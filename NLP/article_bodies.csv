1,"ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - On the eve of Tuesday's historic debate, former President Donald Trump has opened up a small, four-point lead over Vice President Kamala Harris in Georgia, one of about a half-dozen battleground states where the 2024 election will be decided.

The new Quinnipiac University battleground state poll found Trump with 49% support to Harris' 45%, with independent candidate Cornel West and The Party for Socialism and Liberation candidate Claudia De la Cruz each receiving 1%. All other listed third-party candidates received less than 1% support.

The poll also surveyed North Carolina's presidential and gubernatorial races.

""With 32 electoral votes to offer between them, North Carolina and Georgia loom large among the potential pathways to the presidency and neither state offers a clear-cut favorite,"" said Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy. ""In Georgia -- ground zero for political fireworks the last time around -- the Trump ticket has an edge on leadership over Harris.""

The poll was conducted Sept. 4-8 among 969 likely voters in Georgia, with a margin of error of plus/minus 3.2 percentage points.

Here are the poll's highlights:"
2,"Washington -- Vice President Kamala Harris is heading into the presidential debate with former President Donald Trump on Tuesday locked in a tight race with her GOP opponent, but is continuing to see a growing number of Republicans endorse her ahead of the 2024 election.

Harris and Trump are poised to go head-to-head in Philadelphia in their first and maybe only debate before Election Day. Both candidates will have surrogates in the spin room following the matchup, hosted by ABC News. But among those advocating for Harris will be two people who worked in the White House for Trump.

Anthony Scaramucci, who had a brief stint as Trump's White House communications director, and Olivia Troye, who was Homeland Security adviser to Vice President Mike Pence, will be in Philadelphia to speak out against the former president, Harris' campaign said.

Scaramucci and Troye are not the only Republicans who have announced their support for Harris, and the Democratic presidential nominee's campaign rolled out ""Republicans for Harris"" to bolster outreach to GOP voters who oppose Trump.

Several Republicans endorsed Harris at the Democratic National Convention in August, while a group of more than 200 who worked for former Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, as well as Sen. Mitt Romney and the late Sen. John McCain signed onto a letter supporting the Democratic nominee.

Cheney has been one of the most vocal Republican critics of Trump, and she announced her intent to vote for Harris during an event at Duke University on Sept. 4. She represented Wyoming in the House for six years, which included two years in GOP leadership as conference chair before being ousted from the leadership position by pro-Trump Republicans and then defeated by Trump-backed challenger in a primary.

""I don't believe that we have the luxury of writing in candidates' names, particularly in swing states,"" Cheney said. ""As a conservative, as someone who believes in and cares about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this. And because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris.""

The former vice president joined his daughter, Liz Cheney, in announcing his plan to vote for Harris in November. Cheney has a long career in Republican politics, having served four presidents. In addition to being vice president to President George W. Bush, Cheney was secretary of Defense under President George H.W. Bush and White House chief of staff under President Gerald Ford. He represented Wyoming in the House for 10 years.

""In our nation's 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,"" he said in a statement on Sept. 6. ""He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. He can never be trusted with power again. As citizens, we each have a duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution. That is why I will be casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris.""

Like Liz Cheney, Kinzinger has also been one of the most ardent critics of Trump. The former Illinois congressman appeared at the Democratic National Convention on Aug. 22 to urge Republicans to back Harris in November.

""Donald Trump has suffocated the soul of the Republican Party,"" he said. ""His fundamental weakness has coursed through my party like an illness.""

Kinzinger delivered a message to GOP voters to ""vote for our bedrock values and vote for Kamala Harris.""

Grisham was a White House press secretary under Trump and chief of staff to first lady Melania Trump before resigning on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of the former president's supporters violently breached the U.S. Capitol. She addressed the Democratic National Convention on its second night and lambasted Trump as having ""no empathy, no morals and no fidelity to the truth.""

""I love my country more than my party,"" Grisham said. ""Kamala Harris tells the truth. She respects the American people and she has my vote.""

Troye, who was an adviser to Pence, also addressed the Democratic National Convention to speak out against Trump and voice her support for Harris.

She said the Republican nominee's goal is ""to sow doubt and division,"" and characterized a vote for Harris as a vote for democracy.

""You're not betraying our party,"" she said of the GOP. ""You're standing up for our country.""

Scaramucci was White House communications director before he was ousted from the role in July 2017 after serving just 11 days. He has since criticized Trump and the GOP, calling it a ""Trumpist party"" in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

""Kamala Harris is capable and has a great team,"" he said in a July social media post.

Duncan was Georgia's lieutenant governor and split with Trump over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. He, too, delivered remarks at the Democratic National Convention to urge his fellow Republicans to support Harris in the presidential election.

""To my fellow Republicans at home that want to pivot back toward policy, empathy and tone: You know the right thing to do. Now let's have the courage to do it in November,"" Duncan said, calling Harris a ""steady hand.""

3,"PHILADELPHIA, PA -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom is back on the presidential campaign trail.

The high-profile Democrat and two-term governor was one of the top surrogates for President Biden during the president's re-election campaign.

But other than an appearance - but no speaking role - at last month's Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago, Newsom has mostly been off the campaign trail since fellow Californian Vice President Kamala Harris replaced Biden atop the party's 2024 ticket seven and a half weeks ago.

Until now.

Newsom will be one of four Democratic governors - along with Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Roy Cooper of North Carolina and Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico - who will be in the debate spin room on behalf of the vice president.

WHY THE HARRIS-TRUMP DEBATE SHOWDOWN IS SO CRUCIAL

Ahead of his stop in Philadelphia, Newsom was in New York on Sunday to headline a fundraiser for Harris and also made media appearances on behalf of the vice president and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, her running mate.

""What Kamala Harris has done in the past eight weeks is unprecedented in U.S. history. She's closed the gap. We're not just in the margin of error. We've expanded the map of the United States,"" Newsom emphasized early Tuesday in an interview on ""CBS Mornings.""

HARRIS-TRUMP DEBATE BEING HELD IN EXTREMELY CRUCIAL 2024 BATTLEGROUND

Newsom was a prominent Biden surrogate and defended him after the president's disastrous performance in his late June debate against former President Trump, the GOP presidential nominee.

Biden's halting debate delivery instantly fueled questions about his physical and mental abilities to serve another four years in the White House and spurred a rising chorus of calls from within his own party for the 81-year-old president to end his bid for a second term. Facing increased pressure from fellow Democrats, Biden, in a blockbuster announcement on July 21, ended his re-election campaign and endorsed his vice president.

KAMALA HARRIS, DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: LIVE UPDATES

When asked if he would be as voracious for Harris on the campaign trail as he was for Biden, Newsom pointed to his longtime friendship and working relationship with the vice president.

""We knew each other a decade before we both got into politics. One of my oldest friends. So it's a no brainer,"" Newsom told Fox News Digital during the first night of the DNC at Chicago's United Center arena. ""I'm as needed. But obviously all in.""

However, Newsom, who is thought to have long harbored national ambitions of his own, added at the time that he may not be asked by the Harris campaign to hit the trail on behalf of the vice president.

""We'll see. Because everybody's out there. Everybody's doing everything,"" the governor said.

Fast-forward three weeks, and Newsom's back on the campaign trail."

5,"CHICAGO -- For Christopher Pugh, the 2020 election was a turning point.

He already distrusted the government. But as he watched Fox News coverage in the immediate aftermath of the election and read posts on Twitter, the social media platform now known as X, that distrust grew. He now believes the falsehood that the 2020 election was stolen and trusts few people other than former President Donald Trump to deliver him news about election results.

""I trust Donald Trump, not the government,"" said the 38-year-old Republican from Gulfport, Miss. ""That's it.""

While most Americans trust government-certified election results at least a ""moderate"" amount, Republicans are more likely to trust Trump and his campaign, according to a new survey from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and USAFacts. Americans also are heading into the November election with concerns about misinformation. Many have low trust that the information they receive from presidential candidates -- particularly Trump, but also Vice President Kamala Harris -- is based on factual information.

Trump continues to lie about the outcome of the 2020 election, saying it was rigged against him even after dozens of his court challenges failed, reviews, recounts and audits in battleground states all affirmed President Joe Biden's win, and Trump's own attorney general said there was no evidence of widespread fraud. Despite no evidence of any widespread fraud, a 2023 poll found that most Republicans believe Biden was not legitimately elected president."
6,"Washington: Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump are meeting for the first time face-to-face Tuesday night for perhaps their only debate. It is an opportunity to showcase their starkly different visions for the country after a tumultuous campaign summer.

The event, at 9 p.m. Eastern in Philadelphia, will offer Americans their most detailed look at a campaign that's dramatically changed since the last debate in June. It is imperative to mention President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race and the assassination attempt on Trump.

Harris would want to show that she can press the Democratic case against Trump better than Biden did. Trump, in turn, is trying to paint the vice president as an out-of-touch liberal while trying to win over voters sceptical he should return to the White House.

Trump, 78, has struggled to adapt to Harris, 59, who is the first woman, Black person and person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president. The Republican former president has at times resorted to invoking racial and gender stereotypes, frustrating allies who want Trump to focus instead on policy differences with Harris.

The Vice President will attempt to take credit for the successes of the Biden administration while also confronting its failures and justifying her departure from the more liberal stances she adopted previously.

The debate presents a unique opportunity for sustained scrutiny of Harris, who has only participated in one formal interview over the last six weeks.

""If she performs great, it's going to be a nice surprise for the Democrats and they'll rejoice,"" said Ari Fleischer, a Republican communications strategist and former press secretary to President George W. Bush. ""If she flops, like Joe Biden did, it could break this race wide open. So there's more riding on it.""

Tim Hogan, who led Sen. Amy Klobuchar's debate preparations in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, said Harris, a former California attorney general, would bring a ""prosecutor's instincts to the debate stage.""

""That is a very strong quality in that setting: having someone who knows how to land a punch and how to translate it,"" Hogan said.

The initial early ballots for the presidential race are scheduled to be distributed shortly after the debate, which is hosted by ABC News. In Alabama, the dispatch of absentee ballots will commence on Wednesday.

Trump and his campaign have highlighted the far-left stances she adopted during her unsuccessful 2020 presidential campaign. He has received assistance in his informal debate preparation sessions from Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate who sharply criticized Harris during their primary debates.

Harris has sought to defend her shifts away from liberal causes to more moderate stances on fracking, expanding Medicare for all and mandatory gun buyback programs -- and even backing away from her position that plastic straws should be banned -- as pragmatism, insisting that her ""values remain the same."" Her campaign on Monday published a page on its website listing her positions on key issues.

The ex-president has contended that a Harris presidency would endanger the nation's safety, emphasizing that Biden selected her to manage the surge of migrants. This assertion aligns with the Republican's renewed focus on immigration and unauthorized residents in his campaign rhetoric. He aims to depict a Harris presidency as an extension of Biden's administration, which remains unpopular, especially regarding its economic policies, as the electorate continues to experience the effects of inflation despite its recent decline.

Trump's team insist his tone won't be any different facing a female opponent.

""President Trump is going to be himself,"" senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters during a phone call Monday.

Gabbard, who was also on the call, added that Trump ""respects women and doesn't feel the need to be patronizing or to speak to women in any other way than he would speak to a man.""

His advisers suggest Harris has a tendency to express herself in a ""word salad"" of meaningless phrases, prompting Trump to say last week that his debate strategy was to ""let her talk.""

The former president frequently plows into rambling remarks that detour from his policy points. He regularly makes false claims about the last election, attacks a lengthy list of enemies and opponents working against him, offers praise for foreign strongmen and comments about race, like his false claim in July that Harris recently ""happened to turn Black.""

The Vice President, known as the most vocal advocate for abortion access within the Biden administration after the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade in 2022, is anticipated to highlight Trump's contradictory positions on women's reproductive health, including his declaration to support Florida's six-week abortion ban in the upcoming statewide referendum this autumn.

Additionally, Harris aims to present herself as a more reliable leader for the country and its alliances while conflicts persist in Ukraine following over two years of Russian aggression, and as the prolonged war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza continues without a foreseeable conclusion.

She is expected to caution that Trump poses a danger to democracy, citing his efforts in 2020 to reverse his electoral defeat, which incited his supporters to assault the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, and his recent remarks. Last weekend, Trump disseminated another vengeful message on social media, vowing to incarcerate ""those engaged in dishonest conduct,"" encompassing lawyers, political strategists, contributors, voters, and electoral officials if he is victorious.

Harris has spent the better part of the last five days ensconced in debate preparations in Pennsylvania, where she participated in hours-long mock sessions with a Trump stand-in. Ahead of the debate, she told radio host Rickey Smiley that she was workshopping how to respond if Trump lies.

""There's no floor for him in terms of how low he will go,"" she said."
7,"SANTA BARBARA COUNTY, Calif. - The debate between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris may actually only impact a small percentage of the voters, since national polls say most voters have made up their minds.

That doesn't mean the meeting of the candidates won't be of the highest interest to audiences on TV and radio who tune in, but it will more likely reinforce their decisions now going into the voting cycle beginning with the arrival of the ballots in early October for the November 5th election.

The polls show there's still enough voters who are undecided to change the outcome in a tight race, which is what it is shaping up to be.

Central Coast voters will no doubt be as focused on the event and outcome as the rest of the country.

Some spoke to Your News Channel's Tracy Lehr Monday night saying that they will be tuned in, but it is still to be seen if they are going to vote differently based on what the answers are to questions from a news panel.

Harris and Trump will have 90 minutes to cover topics including the economy, immigration, gun control and world crisis points.

(More details, photos and videos will be added here later today.)"
8,"WASHINGTON (OSV News) -- As former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris prepared for their first debate of the 2024 presidential cycle, their party platforms shed light on some key areas of difference between the candidates' policy agendas.

Although the debate will be the first between the pair, it is not the first debate of the 2024 presidential election cycle. President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid in July after a disastrous debate performance the previous month that polls showed solidified voters' concerns about his ability to serve a second term and his age. Harris shifted from the vice presidential candidate to the top of the ticket with Biden's endorsement the same day he announced his decision and formally securing her party's nomination in a matter of weeks.

Questions remain about where Harris' policy positions would differ from the Biden administration if she would become the 47th president. At its August convention, the Democratic Party rolled out a new platform, with some significant changes from previous iterations. The party's pivot to Harris occurred on a short timeline, evident in its 2024 platform, which references ""a second Biden term.""

Likewise, the Republican Party also unveiled a platform at its July convention, the first such document directly overseen by Trump.

Hosffman Ospino, a professor of theology and religious education at Boston College who researches the dialogue between faith and culture as well as Hispanic Catholics, told OSV News that ""taken side by side, both platforms offer starkly different pictures of a nation that ironically has served as home for both Democrats, Republicans and others for many generations.""

""Anyone who takes the time to read them may conclude that there is no common good in our nation,"" Ospino said. ""I refuse to believe that such is the case.""

Ospino said each party ""seems to be envisioning a very different country.""

""Immigration, labor conditions, racial equality, climate concerns, religious freedom, access to basic social services, safety and the guarantee that the judicial system is always fair, among others, are life-or-death realities for most people living in the United States,"" he said. ""Neither platform is completely satisfactory, yet Christian citizens have an obligation to consider each platform from the perspective of the impact that it can have in the lives of most rather than on the individual benefits that they can generate to the few. It is the least we can do as people who proclaim that the most important commandment is love.""

Ospino offered critiques of both platforms, arguing the Republican platform ""demonizes and threatens the well-being of immigrants and their families, scapegoating a population that is making major contributions to the building of this nation,"" while the Democratic platform falls ""mightily short"" from its pledge of social justice ""by choosing silence on the death penalty, making of abortion a political flag rather than speaking about creating conditions for every human life to be respected at every stage.""

Stephen Schneck, a Catholic activist and retired Catholic University of America professor, argued in comments to OSV News that ""the Democratic Party has long been the party of those struggling to achieve the American dream, those living paycheck to paycheck, those who are still working for the rights and equality promised by the Constitution. It's no surprise that the 2024 platform reflects that tradition.""

""Both American political parties fall short of the ideal for political life envisioned in the church's magisterium,"" Schneck said, arguing it is difficult to ""measure a political platform against that.""

""Still, I do appreciate the Democratic platform's greater emphasis on lifting up the most vulnerable in our society and its emphasis on what we Catholics would call 'care for creation,'"" he argued.

The Democratic platform states the party's position on expanding access to abortion and comes as Harris has made increasing access to abortion a key part of her presidential campaign.

The document states the party will oppose ""extreme and dangerous abortion bans"" and that it is ""committed to restoring the reproductive rights Trump ripped away.""

""With a Democratic Congress, we will pass national legislation to make Roe the law of the land again,"" it said.

But in July, members of the Republican National Committee, at the direction of Trump, removed a long-standing call for federal restrictions on abortion after 20 weeks over the objections of pro-life activists who previously asked delegates not to strip the call from the platform. That ban would have attempted to protect nationally about 1% of unborn children who are victims of abortion annually. Pro-life activists were critical of that change, but Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, argued in a July statement that ""the Republican Party remains strongly pro-life at the national level.""

""It is important that the GOP reaffirmed its commitment to protect unborn life today through the 14th Amendment,"" she said. ""Under this amendment, it is Congress that enacts and enforces its provisions.""

Schneck said that ""as a pro-life Democrat I oppose abortion, but am heartened by the platform's promotion of expansive policies for maternal care and strengthened support for early childhood health and education.""

Among other changes to the Democratic agenda was the elimination of a call to end the federal death penalty. The 2020 version of the party's platform stated, ""Democrats continue to support abolishing the death penalty,"" but the 2024 version makes no mention of the practice.

Asked about the removal of the call to end the death penalty from the Democratic Party's platform, Krisanne Vaillancourt Murphy, executive director of the Catholic Mobilizing Network, a group that opposes capital punishment, told OSV News, ""What we know about the federal death penalty is this: it's fallible, expensive and racially biased. Just like state-level capital punishment, federal executions do not make communities safer and they do not deter future instances of crime.""

""As Catholics, we are called to oppose the death penalty in all instances and at every level,"" she said, citing recent writing by Pope Francis, in which the pontiff said, ""Capital executions, far from bringing justice, fuel a sense of revenge that becomes a dangerous poison for the body of our civil societies. ... Indeed, the Jubilee should commit all believers to collectively call for the abolition of the death penalty.""

Vaillancourt Murphy added, ""The federal death penalty has no place in our society. We continue to work with steadfastness for its abolition.""

On immigration, the Democratic platform calls for expanding legal immigration and deterring illegal border crossings.

""A robust immigration system with accessible lawful pathways and penalties for illegal immigration alleviates pressure at the border and upholds our values,"" it stated.

The platform also endorsed the U.S. Citizenship Act, which it said if passed ""would permanently increase family-sponsored and employment-based immigration.""

The RNC platform calls for mass deportations, stating, ""We must deport the millions of illegal Migrants who Joe Biden has deliberately encouraged to invade our Country,"" and lists ""SEAL THE BORDER, AND STOP THE MIGRANT INVASION"" as among promises for a second Trump term.

However, the platform's call for mass deportations runs contrary to the Second Vatican Council's teaching in ""Gaudium et Spes"" condemning ""deportation"" among other actions, such as abortion, that ""poison human society,"" a teaching St. John Paul II affirmed in two encyclicals on moral truth and life issues respectively: ""Veritatis Splendor"" (1993) and ""Evangelium Vitae"" (1995).

The Democratic platform pledged that ""Democrats will protect the First Amendment right to free exercise of religion for everyone, and we will maintain the separation of church and state.""

It argued that in contrast, ""the Trump Administration attacked religious freedom by demonizing some faiths and preferring others.""

""We will advocate for religious freedom across the world,"" it said. ""And, we will continue to honor both religious freedom and other civil rights, not put them at war with one another.""

The Republican platform stated, ""We are the defenders of the First Amendment Right to Religious Liberty. It protects the Right not only to Worship according to the dictates of Conscience, but also to act in accordance with those Beliefs, not just in places of Worship, but in everyday life.""

The document also said, ""Our ranks include men and women from every Faith and Tradition, and we respect the Right of every American to follow his or her deeply held Beliefs,"" but said Republicans support ""a new Federal Task Force on Fighting Anti-Christian Bias that will investigate all forms of illegal discrimination, harassment, and persecution against Christians in America."""
9,"Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the GOP vice presidential nominee, says he wouldn't have certified the 2020 election -- had he been in then-Vice President Mike Pence's position on Jan. 6, 2021 -- until states where then-President Donald Trump and Republicans falsely claimed there was massive electoral fraud submitted ""alternative slates"" of Electoral College electors.

There is no provision in the Constitution for such a scenario and Trump allies are being prosecuted in Michigan, Nevada, Wisconsin, Arizona and Georgia for attempting to replace those states' Electoral College votes for now-President Joe Biden with ones for Trump. The alleged fake electors scheme is a key part of the racketeering prosecution against Trump and several allies in Georgia and in a federal criminal case brought by Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith in Washington.

""I would have asked the states to submit alternative slates of electors and let the country have the debate about what actually matters and what kind of an election that we had,"" Vance said on the venture capitalist podcast ""All-In"" on Monday in Los Angeles. ""I would have asked the states to submit alternative slates. That's what I would have done. Again, I've said that publicly many times.""

The Ohio Republican was asked by host Jason Calacanis, a tech entrepreneur, four times if he would have ""certified the election"" had he been in Pence's position. Four times he declined to say he would. Pence, who was whisked away by Secret Service alongside his wife and daughter as a violent mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol as he oversaw the certification of the Electoral College vote, has said he will not support Trump in 2024.

""I think, in reality, that if Donald Trump wanted to start a nuclear war with Russia, Mike Pence would be at the front of line endorsing him right now,"" Vance charged. ""And fundamentally, the reason the old guard of the Republican Party hates Donald Trump, it's not because of January the sixth, 2021, whatever your views on it, it's because Donald Trump doesn't think that we should start stupid wars in foreign countries, and that's why they all hate him.""

Vance has long questioned the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election, for which no evidence of widespread issues or fraud has ever been found despite years of legal challenges and baseless accusations by Trump and his allies. Dozens of judges and local election officials across the country, including many Republicans, have affirmed the results as legitimate.

In February, Vance said on ABC News ""if I had been vice president, I would have told the states, like Pennsylvania, Georgia and so many others, that we needed to have multiple slates of electors and I think the U.S. Congress should have fought over it from there."" He said similarly in an interview with New York Times columnist Ross Douthat in June.

""The important part is we would have had a big debate. And it doesn't necessarily mean the results would have been any different, but we at least would have had the debate in Pennsylvania and Georgia about how to better have a rational election system where legal ballots are cast,"" Vance said on Monday, naming two states Biden won in 2020. ""Let's talk about Jan. 6 for the next 45 minutes. I'm sure it's the most important thing going on in the country right now.""

Trump said last week he had ""every right"" to attempt to overturn the 2020 election after losing to Biden.

Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign slammed Vance for his comments, warning Trump and Vance are conspiring to seize ""unchecked power.""

""The Trump-Vance ticket is spending the days before the debate ratcheting up their dangerous lies, the same lies that inspired a mob to attack the Capitol and try to overturn the 2020 election,"" Harris campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said in a statement. ""Donald Trump is telling us exactly what he will do if he wins - with the help of his Supreme Court justices, he'll implement his Project 2025 playbook to give himself virtually unlimited, unchecked power and go after his political enemies. Trump's campaign is solely about himself and his revenge and retribution.""

Trump has pledged to purge the federal bureaucracy and replace career civil servants with conservative loyalists, pardon those imprisoned for crimes committed during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack, and imprison his political enemies if he returns to power. In a speech to the Fraternal Order of Police last week, Trump encouraged police to ""watch for voter fraud"" so ""we can keep the cheating to a minimum,"" statements the Harris campaign said amount to ""directing police officers to intimidate election workers and voters."""
10,"ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - Tuesday night's debate between the 45th president of the United States and the nation's 49th vice president might be the only time Donald Trump and Kamala Harris meet face to face this election season.

That's just another reason why tens of millions of Americans are expected to watch the 9 p.m. debate from the city where, almost 250 years ago, the nation's independence was first coined into words: Philadelphia.

Here's everything you need to know about tonight's debate, with the most important piece of information right up front:

You can watch tonight's debate on here, on Atlanta News First and on the ANF+ streaming app (search Atlanta News First anywhere you stream).

Former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee.

Well, Trump is trying to become the first ex-president in history to be elected to the same job after being defeated in his first reelection bid since Grover Cleveland did so back in the 19th century. Trump is also the first convicted felon ever to seek the presidency.

Trump is also seeking to become the first-ever twice-impeached president to reclaim the Oval Office.

On the other side of the stage is Harris, the first woman of color to ever secure a major political party's White House nomination. She's also the nation's first woman and person of color to hold the vice presidency.

You really have been under a rock, haven't you? Biden dropped out of the race after he turned in a disastrous debate performance in late June against Trump in Atlanta.

9 pm EST, 8 pm CST, 7 pm MT, 6 pm PT, or 1 am GMT, if you're into that sort of thing.

The National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. Pennsylvania is expected to be a battleground state in November's presidential election. Georgia - another battleground state - was home to the last presidential debate, back when Biden was still in the race.

""World News Tonight"" anchor David Muir and ABC News Live ""Prime"" anchor Linsey Davis.

The Tuesday night debate -- hosted by ABC News at Philadelphia's National Constitution Center -- has become the first showdown between Harris and Trump, who both agreed to move forward with it after weeks of back-and-forth about its specifics.

According to CBS News, a coin flip determined where Trump and Harris will stand on stage and the order of closing statements.

Trump won the coin toss and chose to give the last closing statement. Harris selected the lectern on the left of the stage, meaning viewers will see her on the right side of their screens.

The campaigns and the network were hashing out the final rules in the days leading up to the debate. The final sticking point was over the microphones.

Harris' campaign wanted both microphones unmuted for the entire event. Trump's team wanted a candidate's microphone to be muted when their opponent is speaking -- a rule the Biden campaign requested during the last debate. The Harris campaign ultimately relented.

Candidates will have two minutes each for their closing statements. There are no opening statements. They will have two minutes to answer moderators' questions, two minutes for rebuttals and an extra minute for follow-ups or clarifications.

Harris and Trump will not be allowed to bring prewritten notes on stage, but will have a pen, notepad and bottle of water at their lecterns.

Campaign staff cannot interact with candidates during the commercial breaks, and there will be no live audience.

ABC has allowed other networks to simulcast the debate. It will air on a number of broadcast and cable networks, including Atlanta News First (CBS) and on the Atlanta News First app."
11,"PHILADELPHIA - It's fitting that Tuesday night's debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump is being held in the key general election battleground state of Pennsylvania.

Harris and Trump will face off at 9 p.m. ET at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, the largest city in the Keystone State. The debate is the first and potentially the only showdown between Harris and Trump.

Both candidates have repeatedly made stops this summer in Pennsylvania, which was one of seven key swing states that decided the outcome of the 2020 election between Trump and President Biden. And Pennsylvania, along with Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada, will likely determine who wins the White House in November.

While the campaigns and their allied super PACs are pouring resources into all seven states, more money has been spent to run spots in Pennsylvania than any of the other battlegrounds. And both sides have dished out more dollars to reserve airtime going forward in the Keystone State than any of the other battlegrounds in the final eight weeks leading up to Election Day on Nov. 5, according to figures from AdImpact, a top national ad tracking firm.

""It's the one state that it's hard to see someone losing and then still winning the presidential race,"" Mark Harris, Pittsburgh-based longtime Republican national strategist and ad maker, told Fox News Digital. ""It's clearly ground zero.""

Harris, a veteran of multiple GOP presidential campaigns said, ""You can see that in media reservations and in the candidates' travel schedules. Clearly, the Trump campaign and the Harris camp believe this is a must-win situation.""

Mike Butler, a Pittsburgh-based Democratic consultant, told Fox News Digital that when it comes to the White House race, ""I don't think any other state quite swings the needle as much as Pennsylvania.""

It is not just the top of the ticket campaigning in Pennsylvania. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democrats' vice presidential nominee, and Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, Trump's running mate, have made numerous stops in the state.

Pennsylvania, along with Michigan and Wisconsin, are the three Rust Belt states that make up the Democrats' so-called ""Blue Wall.""

The party reliably won all three states for a quarter-century before Trump narrowly captured them in the 2016 election to win the White House.

Four years later, in 2020, Biden carried all three states by razor-thin margins to put them back in the Democrats' column, as he defeated Trump.

Fast-forward to the present day, and Pennsylvania remains a jump-ball, as the latest public opinion surveys in the state indicate a margin-of-error race between Harris and Trump.

""It's going to be a fight to the finish. I think Trump has some advantages,"" Harris said. ""But its definitely going to be a very tight race.""

Butler noted that Pennsylvania's had razor-thin margins in the past two presidential elections. ""Trump's numbers are pretty solidly baked in. I can't see him faring any worse than he did the last two times, which means it's going to be a very competitive state,"" he said.

This isn't the first time a presidential debate has been held at the National Constitution Center, which opened 21 years ago and is located on the north end of Independence Mall in Philadelphia's Old City neighborhood.

The venue hosted a 2008 Democratic presidential primary debate.

12,"WASHINGTON -- The second general election debate of the 2024 campaign season is here, but it's the first matchup for the current nominees.

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are taking part in Tuesday night's debate in Philadelphia. After a disastrous performance in the first general election debate of this cycle in June, President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid, upending the campaign in its closing months and kicking off the rapid-fire process that allowed Harris to rise as Democrats' nominee in his place.

The debate will start at 9 p.m. EDT Tuesday and is expected to last 90 minutes. It's being moderated by ""World News Tonight"" anchor David Muir and ""Prime"" anchor Linsey Davis.

What channel is the debate on?

ABC News is carrying the debate live on its broadcast network as well as its streaming platform ABC News Live, Disney+ and Hulu. Several networks have also agreed to carry the event live. The debate will also be steamed here on lvrj.com.

Where is the debate?

The second general election debate of this cycle is taking place at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. As was the case for the June debate, there will be no audience present.

Pennsylvania is perhaps the nation's premier swing state, and both candidates have spent significant time campaigning across Pennsylvania. Trump was holding a rally in Butler, in western Pennsylvania, in mid-July when he was nearly assassinated by a gunman perched on a nearby rooftop. Harris chose Philadelphia as the spot where she unveiled Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate in August.

In 2020, it was Pennsylvania's electoral votes that put Biden over the top and propelled him into the White House, four years after Trump won the state. Biden's victory came after more than three days of uncertainty as election officials sorted through a surge of mail-in votes that delayed the processing of some ballots, and the Trump campaign mounted several legal challenges.

Which candidates will be on stage?

Two candidates -- Harris and Trump -- will be on stage, and it'll be the first time that they've ever met. It's also Harris' first debate since 2020, when she and Trump's running mate -- then-Vice President Mike Pence -- debated through plexiglass shields during the COVID-19 pandemic.

With Biden's departure from the campaign after the first debate, there was some concern whether Trump and Harris would be facing off at all. As the vice president wound her way from Biden's running mate to Democratic nominee, Trump said he had made his initial debate agreement with Biden, inserting doubt into whether he would meet Harris on a debate stage.

Then there was the kerfuffle over the muting of microphones -- except for a candidate's turn to speak -- something Biden's campaign had made a condition of its decision to accept any debates this year. Some aides have said they have come to regret that decision, saying voters were shielded from hearing Trump's outbursts. Harris' campaign said it wanted all microphones to be live, and, while Trump said he'd rather have mics ""probably on,"" his campaign agreed to the same mic muting in place for the June debate with Biden.

The current ABC framework for the second debate has the same rules for mic muting, no live audience or written notes.

So far, the candidates have not come to an agreement on meeting again for another debate.

What's up next?

CBS News will host a vice presidential debate on Oct. 1 between Walz and Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. That event is planned to be held in New York City.

14,"PHILADELPHIA - Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will be face-to-face for the first time during Tuesday night's debate in Philadelphia, marking a pivotal moment during the final sprint of a razor-thin race for the White House.

""We have said over and over again the stakes cannot be higher,"" said Allison Prasch, an expert on U.S. presidential rhetoric at the University of Wisconsin.

A Pew Research Center survey released on Monday suggests the presidential race is deadlocked. It found about half of registered voters -- 49 per cent -- said they would vote for Harris if the election were held today, and an identical share said they would back Trump.

The report, based on a survey conducted from Aug. 26 to Sept. 2, found Trump's advantage is on the economy, with the majority of voters saying they are very or somewhat confident the former president would make good decisions about economic policy.

Harris leads on abortion and several personal traits, including being a good role model and being honest.

Those issues will likely be highlighted during the debate as both candidates make a case for their starkly different visions for the future of America.

Experts say Harris's challenge will be laying out her policies, including on the economy, while also holding back Trump's attacks. Trump's test will be whether he can stay on message and avoid coming off as racist or misogynistic.

Trump's team was preparing the stage Tuesday morning by releasing a new video tying the vice-president's record to decisions by President Joe Biden's administration.

""Kamala Harris has been in the White House for an unimaginable American decline. Basic goods cost more, illegal migrant crime ravages our communities, and we have lost our role as the global leader whose strength brings peace,"" Brian Hughes, Trump campaign senior adviser, said in a news release.

Harris's camp, on the other hand, was arguing there's a risk to democracy if there is a second Trump administration. Instead of holing up with advisers to prepare for the debate, Trump spent the weekend making claims about voter fraud and alleging he would prosecute anyone who ""cheats"" in the election.

""The Trump-Vance ticket is spending the days before the debate ratcheting up their dangerous lies, the same lies that inspired a mob to attack the Capitol and try to overturn the 2020 election,"" said Harris-Walz spokesperson Ammar Moussa in a news release.

This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 10, 2024."
15,"SAN FRANCISCO -- A third character could play a major role in Kamala Harris and Donald Trump's presidential debate tonight -- the state of California.

As he tests lines of attack against his new opponent, Trump has leaned on GOP caricatures of Harris' deep-blue home state as a lawless dystopia rife with tent encampments and shuttered retail stores -- the result of failed Democratic policies. A President Harris would bring that hellscape to the rest of the nation, he argues.

Contentious proposals passed by the Democratic-supermajority statehouse have already created fodder for the Trump campaign, including a bill Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed last week to help undocumented immigrants purchase homes.

Tony Strickland, Orange County chair for the Trump campaign, said he has encouraged the campaign to tie Harris to California's liberal policies and deep-seated affordability problems. He said he expects Trump will continue hammering that theme at the debate.

""Sometimes, people don't realize how bad it is. San Francisco used to be one of the most beautiful cities in the world,"" said Strickland, a Republican city councilmember in affluent coastal Huntington Beach. ""Take it from me, the last thing people want in Middle America is what we have in California.""

But don't expect Harris to rally to California's defense. She's more likely to defend her own record as a prosecutor who locked up rapists and cartel members before turning the tables on Trump, who she said she expects to lie repeatedly on the debate stage.

Harris' team is focused on touting her record in the White House, where the Biden administration passed the largest infrastructure bill in generations, helped the nation recover from the pandemic and put her at the tip of the spear on defending abortion rights after they were struck down by the Supreme Court. But her campaign is sensitive about the state of the economy, and while she's stuck close to Biden personally, her larger goal is to present herself as the candidate of the future, and Trump a figure of the past -- including telegraphing how she plans to lead the country independent of the current administration.

California Rep. Robert Garcia, a national co-chair of the Harris-Walz campaign and her longtime friend, said the GOP's effort to tie Harris to progressive California policies, especially those she wasn't involved in, suggests the Trump camp is still struggling to find its footing.

""They have not been able to do so, moving from one bizarre attack to another,"" Garcia said. ""Everyone knows the vice president is from California. People are going to focus on her record as vice president.""

Republicans have long used California's ultra-liberal reputation to negatively frame prominent leaders from the state, such as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, as out-of-touch elites from the ""Left Coast."" Harris' resume has made that framing more difficult given that career in California was dominated by her work as attorney general, though she did tack left when she was in the Senate and ran for president in 2019.

Brian Brokaw, a Sacramento-based former Harris adviser, said while Trump allies want to blame the vice president for policies that emerged years after she left office in California, he doubts that ""phony"" attack resonates beyond the Republican base already in Trump's corner.

""She's not running for president of California, she's running for president of these United States,"" Brokaw said. ""The comrade Kamala B.S. just doesn't have anything behind it.""

Here are a few of the areas where Trump is likely to attack.

Trump and Republicans in California have consistently sought to cast Harris as soft on crime by anchoring her to the bitter fight over Proposition 47, a decade-old ballot measure that relaxed tough sentencing laws from the 1990s.

Critics say the measure has caused a surge in smash-and-grab thefts and fueled the state's fentanyl epidemic because offenders don't fear they will be arrested or face prison time.

Harris had no role in crafting or promoting the measure. She didn't take a stance on Prop 47 when it was on the ballot during her tenure as attorney general in 2014, which infuriated progressives. She argued she needed to be neutral because her office wrote the ballot summary for it.

That hasn't stopped Trump from blaming her for the initiative's perceived consequences: ""That was her that did that,"" he said last month at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. ""I didn't know this, but you're allowed to rob a store as long as it's not more than $950.""

Harris hasn't taken a stance on a contentious November ballot initiative to roll back parts of Prop 47 that has won the support of some prominent Democratic mayors as well as Republicans.

The GOP has framed Harris as ultra-liberal on immigration, citing her time as district attorney in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, as well as state lawmakers' more recent pro-immigrant policies.

Trump last week called for banning undocumented immigrants from receiving home loans -- a position he took days after legislators in Sacramento approved a proposal to help undocumented immigrants purchase homes. Newsom vetoed the measure on Friday, blunting the issue ahead of the debate.

Still, Republicans have pointed to Harris' defense of city sanctuary policies limiting police cooperation with federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The GOP has also pointed to her more liberal stance on immigration during her last presidential campaign, when she agreed during a debate that migrants crossing the U.S. border should not be subject to criminal penalties.

""They're trying to turn her into a new person that she's not,"" said Strickland, the Orange Country Trump campaign chair.

Harris' allies have stressed that her support for tougher border enforcement isn't new. As attorney general, she embraced a crackdown on transnational gangs and expanded a task force designed to share intelligence on cross-border criminals.

""She's not ideological, and I think that's actually one of her greatest strengths,"" Brokaw, her former adviser, added.

Homelessness is perhaps one of Trump's favorite anti-California targets. He has repeatedly described the demise of the state, and has called San Francisco ""slum like.""

Trump argued this summer that Newsom's executive order directing cities to clear more encampments was a ploy to help Harris win the election. (Newsom's order actually came after a Supreme Court ruling allowed cities to enforce encampment bans, and cities including San Francisco have since taken a harder line.)

""She destroyed California,"" Trump said at a press conference in August. ""San Francisco was a great city 15 years ago. Now, it's almost considered unlivable.""

Democrats were quick to turn the attack line against Trump, noting that Harris and Newsom were the city's district attorney and mayor 15 years ago.

A debate on homelessness could give Harris an opening to tout one of her proposals to make housing more affordable: speeding up construction.

Harris has embraced policies promoted by the Yes in My Back Yard (or YIMBY) movement, which started in San Francisco and blames local regulations and resistance to development for the state's housing affordability crisis.

She has vowed to spur the construction of 3 million new homes by helping to ease such local planning restrictions. ""In many places, it's too difficult to build, and it's driving prices up,"" she said at a recent rally in North Carolina."

Maine voter registration cards can also be downloaded by clicking here. Instructions for completing the voter registration card can be found by clicking here. People who are unable to print voter registration cards can click here to find contact information for their town clerk, who will mail a card to them.

A printed version of the voter registration card with a voter's original signature must be kept on file by their town clerk, so cards cannot be submitted electronically. Completed voter registration cards may be hand-delivered or mailed to your town office or city hall. Click here to find addresses for those municipal buildings. Voter registration cards can also be sent to the Maine Secretary of State's Office in Augusta.

People who are registering to vote in Maine for the first time will need to provide identity documentation that shows they have established residence in the state. The following documents are acceptable proof of identification for the purposes of registering to vote:

Deadlines for voter registration

There is no cut-off date for registering to vote in person at a town office or city hall, which means people can register in person on Nov. 5. People can also register to vote on Election Day at their polling place.

For those who wish to complete their voter registration by mail or through a voter registration drive, the cut-off date for their municipal office to receive their registration card is the close of business on the 21st day before the election -- which is Oct. 15 for the Nov. 5 general election.

Where to vote on Election Day

Every town and city in Maine has its own polling places. You can call your local town office or city hall to find out where you can vote on Election Day, or you can click here to use the state's online voter information lookup service.

Polling place locations can be updated by municipalities by up to 10 days prior to the election, so people are encouraged to double-check where they should cast their ballot in the days leading up to Nov. 5.

What time do the polls open and close?

Polling places in Maine will open sometime between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m., depending on the population of the city or town.

Polls typically open between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. for municipalities with a population of 500 or more, while municipalities with fewer than 500 people may open voting locations as late as 10 a.m.

Mainers are encouraged to contact their local officials, who can provide them with an exact opening time for their polling place.

All polling places in Maine close at 8 p.m. on Election Day. Voters should know that if they are in line at their polling place at 8 p.m. on Nov. 5, they may be allowed to register and vote. Click here for a full guide to Maine voter rights.

How to fill out a ballot

The state of Maine uses paper ballots that voters mark by filling in an oval next to their choices. There are also instructions printed on each ballot that tell voters how to mark their choices.

Voters with questions can ask an election official for help. If a voter makes a mistake, they must fold their ballot and hand it to an election official, who will provide them with a new ballot.

Those who need help reading or marking their ballot can get assistance from a relative or friend, who does not need to be a registered voter or old enough to vote. Election officials can also help voters read or mark their ballots.

However, a voter's employer or union official is prohibited from helping them fill out their ballot. Click here for a full guide to Maine voter rights.

Voting in this election is a bit different, here's how

Maine uses ranked-choice voting in its general elections for federal offices only, which in this year's election means the President of the United States, one of Maine's two U.S. Senate seats and both of Maine's U.S. House representatives.

Ranked-choice voting allows voters to choose candidates in order of preference. So, in this year's general election, there are five candidates on Maine's presidential ballot, and there will also be a write-in spot. That means voters can rank the candidates 1-6 in order of preference.

Voters are not required to choose more than one candidate if they do not want to participate in ranked-choice voting. But if a voter chooses more than one candidate for their top-ranked spot, their vote will not count since election officials will be unable to tell which candidate the voter wanted to cast their ballot for. If a voter chooses a single candidate in multiple ranking spots, then only the voter's first-choice vote will be counted.

When ballots are being counted on election night, only first-choice votes will be tabulated at first. If one candidate receives a majority of the total first-choice votes, then they will be declared the winner of the election. But if no candidate receives a majority, the voting will move into ranked-choice voting rounds.

Click here to watch a video from the Maine Secretary of State's Office that explains how ballots are counted during ranked-choice voting rounds. For those wondering how to properly mark a ranked-choice ballot, click here to see examples.

Do ballots have to be cast in person on Election Day?

Any registered voter in Maine may cast an absentee ballot instead of voting in person at their polling place. Voters do not need to have a specific reason or be unable to vote at the polls on Election Day in order to receive an absentee ballot.

Mainers have been able to request absentee ballots since early August and will be able to do so until 5 p.m. on the third business day prior to the election, which will be Thursday, Oct. 31 for this year's general election.

There are five allowable reasons for requesting an absentee ballot after the deadline, which are the following:

A voter facing any of these scenarios must complete and sign a special circumstances application, which can be obtained from their municipal clerk or the Maine Secretary of State's Office.

Election officials encourage voters to make their absentee ballot request early in order to allow enough time for the ballot to be mailed to them. Voters planning to use the U.S. mail to receive their absentee ballot should make the request no later than 15 days prior to Election Day.

Requesting an absentee ballot

Maine citizens who are registered to vote may use the state's free online absentee ballot request service by clicking here.

Voters can also call the municipal clerk in the town or city where they are registered to vote to request an absentee ballot. Uniformed Service and Overseas voters must request an absentee ballot directly from the Secretary of State's Division of Elections.

In addition, voters can make a written request by completing an absentee ballot application, which are mailed out by election officials or can be downloaded by clicking here. An absentee ballot can also be obtained for an immediate family member in the same way.

Maine election law provides that a voter who will be at least 65 years of age by the next election or who self-identifies as having a disability may apply for ongoing absentee voter status. A voter who qualifies will automatically receive an absentee ballot for each statewide election, municipal election and any other election for which the voter is eligible to vote and need not submit a request for each election. Click here to download an application for ongoing absentee ballot status.

Finally, voters may make a written request for a ""third person"" -- someone other than the voter or an immediate family member of the voter -- to obtain and hand-deliver an absentee ballot. That specific third person who will handle and deliver the ballot must be designated by the voter in a written request or application, and only that designated third person may handle the absentee ballot. Ballots cast this way must be witnessed by either a notary public, a municipal clerk, a clerk of courts or two other witnesses.

Receiving and submitting an absentee ballot

Voters who make their absentee ballot request before the deadline will receive their ballot in the mail at the address they provided.

Printed ballots are sent out to Maine's municipal clerks 30 days before Election Day and they begin to mail them out shortly thereafter. Voters who submit an absentee ballot request in the 30 days before Nov. 5 will likely receive their ballot within seven to 10 business days.

Once they receive their absentee ballot, voters must fill them out and deliver them to their municipal clerk -- or to the Secretary of State's Office if they're a Uniformed Service or Overseas voter. Absentee ballots can be delivered via mail or dropped off either in person or via absentee ballot drop box at a municipal clerk's office.

Voters who choose to send their absentee ballots back by U.S. mail are advised to send their ballot no later than seven business days before Election Day.

In order to be counted, absentee ballots must be received by a municipal clerk by 8 p.m. on Nov. 5.

Maine has an absentee ballot tracking system that shows voters the date their application was accepted by their municipal clerk, the date their clerk mailed out their absentee ballot and the date the clerk received the ballot. Click here to check the status of your absentee ballot.

Voting via absentee ballot in person

Voters may choose to vote absentee at their municipal clerk's office as soon as absentee ballots are available, which is at least 30 days before the election. Those who choose to vote in person at the clerk's office do not need to complete an absentee ballot application. The deadline for absentee voting in the presence of a municipal clerk is 5 p.m. on the Thursday before the election, which is Oct. 31 this year -- unless special circumstances exist.

How officials prevent people from voting twice

When a voter casts an absentee ballot in the state of Maine, their municipal clerk will receive the ballot and verify that it can be accepted. Once the clerk does so, they will mark the voter's name in the voter system as ""AV"" for ""absentee voter."" So when the incoming voter list is printed just before Election Day, voters whose absentee ballots have been received will be checked off the list, and they will not be eligible to receive a ballot if they show up to vote in person.

Officials also said that on Election Day, some voters are still dropping off their absentee ballots, and the offices of municipal clerks are still receiving some by mail. Absentee ballots are processed in batches throughout the day, and the list of those newly received ballots is then shared with each polling place for each batch. Therefore, if an absentee voter tries to vote in person, they will not be able to do so.

Conversely, if a voter who submitted an absentee ballot votes in person before their absentee ballot arrives at their municipal clerk's office, their absentee ballot will be rejected.

Who is on this year's ballot?

In the 2024 general election, Mainers will vote for the office of President of the United States, one of Maine's two U.S. Senate seats, the state's two U.S. House representatives, members of the Maine Legislature (state senators and state representatives) and certain county officers.

The county officers who are up for election will vary depending on the county, but include the following offices: Judge of Probate, Register of Probate, County Treasurer, Register of Deeds, District Attorney and County Commissioner.

17,"Lansing -- Michigan state Rep. Matt Maddock, a Republican and ally of Donald Trump, says Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson ""will be prosecuted and convicted"" if the former president wins another term in the White House this fall.

However, Maddock, who received Trump's endorsement in 2022 for the state House, didn't identify what specific crimes Benson had committed, and instead, pointed to a series of election practices -- some of which Benson wasn't directly involved in -- as violations.

Maddock sent out his initial social media post on the subject Monday night. It came two days after Trump claimed, without providing details to support his accusations, that there was ""rampant cheating"" in the 2020 presidential election and individuals who cheated ""will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, which will include long-term prison sentences.""

In the November 2022 election -- occurring after Trump began making false claims that the 2020 race had been stolen from him because of widespread fraud that have never been proven -- Michigan voters chose to give Benson another four-year term as secretary of state.

Benson, the former dean of Wayne State University's law school, defeated Republican Kristina Karamo by 14 percentage points, 56%-42%, in 2022. Karamo never conceded that she lost.

More: Trump's rhetoric on elections turns ominous as voting nears in the presidential race

Asked about Maddock's comments, Benson's spokeswoman Angela Benander said when Trump makes ""vitriolic, baseless threats against election officials who are simply doing their jobs, this is the kind of false rhetoric it inspires.""

""The secretary's commitment -- and the responsibility of every election official in the nation -- is to rise above the noise and focus on continuing to ensure our elections are fair, secure, accessible and that the results are an accurate reflection of the will of the people,"" Benander said. ""No amount of lies, delusions or threats will distract us from that purpose.""

The Nov. 5 presidential election is less than two months away. Voters will decide whether Trump or Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, the current vice president, will lead the country for the next four years.

More: The Harris-Trump debate becomes the 2024 election's latest landmark event

In a series of tweets over Monday and Tuesday, Maddock said Trump will win the upcoming election and a ""new and improved"" U.S. Department of Justice ""will prosecute Benson and many others for the crimes they committed while rigging elections.""

""Benson will be prosecuted and convicted for the 20 election laws she broke in 2020,"" Maddock said.

Maddock posted a list of 23 election-related actions he believes represented violations, but he didn't cite specific laws.

Many of the allegations appeared to be focused on the alleged actions of local clerks who directly oversee vote counting across the state of Michigan, and not Benson herself.

Among the violations that Maddock alleged but that didn't appear to be because of Benson's actions were ""removal of poll challengers on Election Day,"" ""removal of poll inspectors on Election Day"" and ""failure to match ballot number with absentee ballot registration.""

Another violation alleged by Maddock was ""counting ballots after 8 p.m. deadline.""

As secretary of state, Benson doesn't count ballots, and there's no such 8 p.m. deadline, said Chris Thomas, who served as Michigan's elections director for more than 30 years under Republican and Democratic secretaries of state.

Likewise, Maddock accused Benson of accepting ballots from from the ""criminally insane/incarcerated"" and accepting ballots from ""those registered in other states."" Thomas said as secretary of state, Benson, isn't the person who accepts ballots; local clerks collect and tally ballots.

Another allegation made by Maddock was that Benson was somehow involved in ""counting over votes through adjudication."" As secretary of state, Benson doesn't make decisions about individual ballots, Thomas said.

Maddock's comments amounted to unnecessary hyperbole, Thomas said.

Maddock was first elected to the state House in 2018. He is the president of A-1 Bail Bonds.

In 2021, Trump said Matt Maddock had his ""complete and total endorsement"" tor the state House. ""We need leadership in Michigan who will investigate and document the 2020 voter fraud, the crime of the century,"" Trump added.

Maddock's wife, former Michigan Republican Party Co-Chairwoman Meshawn Maddock, is currently facing felony forgery charges, brought by Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel, for being one of 16 Trump supporters who signed a certificate falsely claiming he had won the state's 16 electoral votes in 2020.

Meshawn Maddock has pleaded not guilty. The false certificates were used by Trump's campaign in an attempt to overturn his loss to Democrat Joe Biden.

The Maddocks have been longtime allies to Trump, visiting both Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. In the past, Meshawn Maddock has repeatedly talked about phone calls she's been on with Trump himself.

Michigan state Sen. Jeremy Moss, D-Southfield, said he didn't believe Democratic legislators had gotten ""ahead of the justice system"" in Meshawn Maddock's prosecution the way Matt Maddock was vowing that Benson ""will be prosecuted.""

People should take the comments Maddock and Trump made about election officials ""incredibly seriously,"" Moss said."
18,"(PHILADELPHIA) -- Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will meet for the first time on Tuesday for the ABC News presidential debate.

It is the only debate the two have scheduled and comes at a critical point as polls show a neck-and-neck race with just eight weeks until Election Day.

The two will face off on key issues starting at 9 p.m. ET. The debate will air on ABC and stream on ABC News Live, Disney+ and Hulu.

Here's how the news is developing:

Trump campaign spokesperson says he's not engaged in traditional debate prep

Trump campaign spokesperson Danielle Alvarez said Tuesday morning on ABC News Live that Trump ""does not do traditional debate prep"" and reiterated that he has been campaigning and engaging in policy discussions instead.

""I would say that the president does not do traditional debate prep. He's on the campaign trail constantly. We see him in key battleground states every week, joined by tens of thousands of patriots,"" she said. ""We know that he does tough interviews, both nationally, locally.""

""That's truly how he prepares for these debates, having those conversations every day. He's ready to step back into the White House,"" she continued. ""We also know that he prefers to have those policy discussions, and he's been doing that with elected members in Congress like Matt Gaetz, with former Congress member Tulsi Gabbard and others -- very similar to what he did to prepare for that first debate against Joe Biden. He has prepared in a similar way again, just by getting out there and talking every day to voters and talking to media.""

Harris not 'underestimating' Trump ahead of debate: Source

Just hours away from the debate, a campaign source is setting expectations that Harris is not ""underestimating"" Trump's ability to debate, and that it would be a ""mistake"" to do so.

The Harris team expects Trump to be ""good"" at debating, stressing that Trump has done this more than anybody else, while it will be Harris's first presidential debate.

The Harris campaign is ""happy to get under [Trump's] skin,"" and they hope that bringing former Trump officials into the spin room later this evening will accomplish this.

On a campaign call last night, a source said Harris is ready for any version of Trump that shows up -- whether it's the presidential Trump, the more mellow Trump during the Biden debate or a more aggressive version.

Harris and Trump square off Tuesday at what could be their only presidential debate, setting high stakes for an event expected to be viewed by millions of Americans and a key sliver of undecided voters. Here's what to look out for.

Can Trump stay focused on policy? Staying on message on his four-year economic record is key, while veering into personal attacks would be counterproductive, allies told ABC News.

Harris has dual goals: make the case for herself as someone who would be a capable president and get under Trump's skin. How will she introduce herself to undecided voters?

Harris releases new ad repurposing Obama's dig at Trump

Vice President Kamala Harris repurposed former President Barack Obama's suggestive dig at Trump over what Obama called his ""weird obsession with crowd sizes"" while speaking at the Democratic National Convention last month.

""Here's a 78-year-old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems ..."" Obama said in the clip used in the ad, just before a clip of Trump at rally plays.

""Ooh, she had a big crowd! Ooh, that crowd,"" Trump said in the snippet, mocking news reports about turnout for Harris.

""This weird obsession with crowd sizes... it just goes on, and on, and on,"" Obama says as the ad returns to him, followed by shots of small Trump crowds and sounds of crickets chirping.

""America's ready for a new chapter. We are ready for a President Kamala Harris,"" Obama says.

The Harris campaign said the ad, titled ""Crowd Size,"" will air on Fox News the day of the debate because ""Trump is known to watch"" the network.

The 30-second ad is set to air nationally on cable news and in local West Palm Beach and Philadelphia markets.

19,"WASHINGTON -- House Speaker Mike Johnson is hosting a ceremony Tuesday to posthumously present Congress' highest honor -- the Congressional Gold Medal -- to 13 U.S. service members who were killed during the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, even as the politics of a presidential election swirl around the event.

Among the 13 honored is Staff Sgt. Taylor Hoover, a 2008 graduate of Hillcrest High School in Midvale who was killed in the attack outside the Kabul airport.

Both Democrats and Republicans supported the legislation to honor the 13 U.S. troops, who were killed along with more than 170 Afghans in a suicide bombing at Abbey Gate near Kabul's Airport in August 2021. President Joe Biden signed the legislation in December 2021. The top Republican and Democratic leaders for both the House and Senate are expected to speak at Tuesday's ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda.

The event is taking place against the backdrop of a bitter back and forth over who is to blame for the rushed and deadly evacuation from Kabul. Johnson scheduled the ceremony just hours before the first debate between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump.

House Republicans also released a scathing investigation on Sunday into the withdrawal that cast blame on Biden's administration and minimized the role of Trump, who had signed the withdrawal deal with the Taliban.

Johnson, a Louisiana Republican and Trump ally, praised the House report, which was led by the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Republican Rep. Michael McCaul.

""We must not allow the Biden-Harris Administration to rewrite history,"" Johnson said in a statement. ""The families of the 13 fallen servicemembers and the allies we abandoned in Afghanistan deserve better.""

White House national security spokesman John Kirby on Monday criticized the House report as partisan and one-sided, and said it revealed little new information as well as several inaccuracies. He noted that evacuation plans had started well before the pullout and the U.S. did not hand over equipment to the Taliban. He said the fall of Kabul ""moved a lot faster than anyone could have anticipated.""

He also acknowledged that during the evacuation ""not everything went according to plan. Nothing ever does.""

""We hold ourselves all accountable for that,"" he said of the deaths.

Kirby added there would be ""quite a few"" people from the Department of Defense at the ceremony Tuesday.

The top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, also issued a memorandum in response to the GOP report, saying he was concerned by the ""attempts to politicize the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.""

""Republicans' partisan attempts to garner headlines rather than acknowledge the full facts and substance of their investigation have only increased with the heat of an election season,"" Meeks said.

Pentagon reviews have concluded that the suicide bombing was not preventable, and that suggestions troops may have seen the would-be bomber were not true.

Regardless, Trump has thrust the withdrawal, with the backing from some of the families of the Americans killed, into the center of his campaign. Last month, his political team distributed video of him attending a wreath-laying ceremony for the fallen service members at Arlington National Cemetery on the third anniversary of the bombing, despite the cemetery's prohibition on partisan activity on the grounds as well as an altercation with a cemetery employee who was trying to make sure the campaign followed those rules.

The Gold Star military families who invited him to the Arlington ceremony have defended Trump's actions. At a fiery news conference outside the Capitol Monday, they implored for the House report to be taken seriously and demanded accountability for those in leadership during evacuation from Kabul.

""President Trump is certainly not perfect. But he's a far better choice, in my opinion, than the mess that Biden and Harris have created since Kabul,"" said Paula Knauss Selph, whose son Ryan Knauss died in the Abbey Gate attack.

While Trump and Republicans have sought to link Harris to the withdrawal as a campaign issue, and Harris has said she was the last person in the room when Biden made his decision, neither watchdog reviews nor the 18-month investigation by House Republicans have identified any instance where the vice president had a significant impact on decision-making.

Still, House Republicans argued that Harris, as well as Biden's national security team, needed to face accountability for the consequences of the deadly withdrawal.

""Kamala Harris wants to be the president of the United States. She wants to be commander in chief. She needs to answer for this report immediately,"" said Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican on the committee.

McCaul, the chairman, also defended the timing of the report by saying that the committee's investigation had to overcome resistance from the Biden administration.

He cast the investigation as a ""truth-seeking mission"" rather than a partisan endeavor, but also bragged that out of all the investigations that House Republicans have launched into the Biden administration in the last two years ""this investigation is the one they fear the most.""

Most assessments have concluded Trump and Biden share blame for the disastrous end to America's longest war, which saw enemy Taliban take over Afghanistan again before the last American troops even flew out of the Kabul airport. The main U.S. government watchdog for the war points to Trump's 2020 deal with the Taliban to withdraw all U.S. forces and military contractors as ""the single most important factor"" in the collapse of U.S.-allied Afghan security forces and Taliban takeover.

Biden's April 2021 announcement that he would proceed with the withdrawal set in motion by Trump was the second-biggest factor, the watchdog said.

Both Trump and Biden kept up the staged withdrawal of U.S. forces, and in Trump's case sharply cut back important U.S. airstrikes in the Taliban, even though the Taliban failed to enter into substantive negotiations with the U.S.-backed civilian government as required by Trump's withdrawal deal.

""To the families who are here, and the many of you have yet to hear these words, so I will say them: we are sorry,"" Johnson said.

21,"BOSTON - Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will not appear on the ballot in Massachusetts for the Nov. 2024 presidential election, Secretary of State Bill Galvin announced Tuesday.

Kennedy was running for president as an independent up until August, but suspended his campaign and endorsed Republican nominee Donald Trump.

Kennedy had collected enough signatures to qualify for the Massachusetts ballot, according to the secretary of state.

""In light of the candidate's recent public statements about the status of his campaign, the Kennedy campaign has assented to the removal of his name from the ballot in Massachusetts,"" Galvin's office said in a statement.

When Kennedy announced his campaign suspension, he initially said he would seek to remove his name from the ballot in 10 battleground states ""where my presence would be a spoiler,"" but remain on the ballot in noncompetitive states.

Since then, however, Kennedy has moved to take his name off ballots in states where the race between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris is not considered to be close. Kennedy also urged his supporters in an email on Sept. 5 to vote for Trump in all states, not just battlegrounds.

On Monday, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that Kennedy will have to stay on the ballot in the hotly contested state. Click here to see a map showing where Kennedy is on the ballot in the 2024 election.

Earlier in the year before the presidential primaries there was a push by some advocates to remove Trump from the Massachusetts ballot over his role in the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol.

22,"(The Center Square) - Public school students in New York City will receive lessons critical of capitalism and asserting that Black Americans should receive reparations, that student loans are equivalent to ""debt peonage,"" the tenets of the Black Lives Matter movement and arguments for abolishing the police.

The 520-page Black Studies Curriculum, which is being implemented by New York City Public Schools this fall, provides lesson plan outlines for teachers on controversial topics like the case for reparations, voter ID laws and the difference between defunding, reforming and abolishing the police.

While many of the topics discussed would likely not be considered controversial, there are some classroom discussions that seem to be driven by stating controversial viewpoints as fact.

Included in the document for 11th-grade students are lesson objectives focused on reparations for Black Americans and the different arguments for reforming, defunding and abolishing the police.

""Students will be able to understand the need for reparations through the historical system of debt peonage, and its resurfaced form via student loan debt,"" a Grade 11 plan overview objective reads.

The lesson defines debt peonage from Webster's Dictionary as ""The use of laborers bound in servitude because of debt"" or a ""A system of convict labor by which convicts are leased to contractors.""

The curriculum defines debt peonage as the system that replaced slavery in the American South which ""exploited Black labor, families, and the attainment of wealth by keeping Black families/people in a continual state of debt - unable to catch up and close the wealth gap.""

That system is still in effect today, the curriculum asserts.

""It also shows up in various contemporary systems in the United States today like systems of incarceration, student loan debt, and housing,"" the curriculum reads.

In another lesson, the curriculum requires teachers to explain to 11th graders the differences between reforming, defunding and abolishing police departments.

""Students will be able to understand the history of policing in America and identify, analyze and explain the difference between the terms reform, defunding, and abolition in order to answer the following essential question: Are Black communities policed differently than other communities in the United States? In New York City? Should we reform, defund or abolish policing in our communities?""

The lesson on policing assumes students ""understand the BLM Movement origins, founders, policy and political aims"" before the lesson begins. The lesson directs students to read a Vox article called ""Police reform, defunding, and abolition, explained.""

""George Floyd's murder and the violence that other Black and brown people have suffered at the hands of police across the country raise police reform concerns. There are many ways to address police reform, from 'delegitimizing the police' to 'restoring legitimacy,"" the curriculum reads.

Students are directed to visit three different stations related to the article ""Station #1: Reforming the Police,"" ""Station #2: Defunding the Police,"" and ""Station #3: The Abolition Vision."" Students are directed to support one of the methods for police reform or an article explaining why they would not choose to reform the police.

Some of the lessons seem to take positions that would establish which political party students should emulate.

Back-to-back lessons for 12th-grade students call Vice President Kamala Harris a ""Black Sheroe"" in the ""Fight for American Democracy"" while using former President Donald Trump's tweets as the basis for a lesson on voter suppression.

In the first lesson, students are directed to create biographies for Black Women in Politics, including Harris. Students were then told to have a ""role play mixer,"" where they would talk with other students to learn more about the historical and current ""Black Sheroes.""

In the next lesson, called ""The Black Vote and Current Trends in Voter Legislation in the United States,"" teachers are told to use tweets from Trump on the 2020 election and ask students about whether the ""ideas in Donald Trump's Tweet influence voting or access to voting.""

Voter identification laws are described as a way to keep Black people from voting. Such provisions are contentious in states like Georgia, where Republicans passed measures requiring voters to show identification, citing election integrity.

Activists have argued that such measures are reminiscent of a poll tax and have filed lawsuits against the state. The curriculum invokes the Georgia law as an activity on voter suppression.

""Inform students they will be assigned an article from the Georgia Voting Law that they will read, annotate, and analyze,"" the curriculum reads. ""After distributing one of the articles to students, tell them they will share details about their article with a partner, and discuss if the actions in their article are a form of voter suppression.""

Students are also told how ""slavery financed the American economy and built wealth for American companies and institutions.""

""Economic lessons include an investigation of the role slavery played in the development of American capitalism and wealth, as well as Black entrepreneurialism, cultural appropriation, and economic independence,"" the document reads.

23,"PHOENIX - Tucson will get a double-dose of presidential campaigning on Thursday, with second gentleman Douglas Emhoff set to appear there the same day as Republican nominee Donald Trump.

Emhoff will stop in Arizona's second most populous city to support his wife, Vice President Kamala Harris, as part of the Democrats' ""New Way Forward"" tour of battleground states, the campaign announced Tuesday.

Other than the date, no other details were released about the second gentleman's upcoming southern Arizona appearance. He'll also campaign in Henderson, Nevada, on Thursday and attend an event in central Florida the next day as part of the tour.

If Harris wins the November election, she'll become the first female president in U.S. history and Emhoff would be the country's first person to use the moniker of first gentleman.

The Emhoff announcement came a day after the Trump campaign said the former president would speak at the Linda Ronstadt Music Hall in Tucson at 2 p.m. Thursday.

The Arizona campaign events will take place two days after Trump faces off with Harris in a presidential debate Tuesday night.

25,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. congressional leaders on Tuesday posthumously awarded the congressional gold medal to 13 service members killed in the Aug. 26, 2021, suicide bombing at Kabul's airport during the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.

The ceremony, led by Republican House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, came as Republicans and Democrats traded accusations of politicizing events surrounding the deadly withdrawal with only eight weeks before U.S. elections.

""Although we can never fully measure your loss, we can and we must memorialize the ultimate sacrifice that was paid,"" Johnson told relatives of the troops who died in the attack.

On Monday, House Republicans released a long-awaited report blasting Democratic President Joe Biden's administration for failures surrounding the withdrawal.

Additionally, the ceremony took place hours before the Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, was to meet former Republican President Donald Trump, his party's nominee, in their only scheduled debate during campaigning for the Nov. 5 election.

Democrats have insisted that some blame for the messy end of the war - less than seven months into Biden's presidency - should be laid at the feet of Trump, who began the withdrawal process by signing a deal with the Taliban in 2020.

Republicans have dismissed that contention as partisan politics, saying Biden could have ignored Trump's agreement or enforced it, accusing Biden administration officials of allowing the Taliban to disregard its commitments and failing to be honest with the U.S. public.

Trump has been criticized for shooting video for his campaign at Arlington National Cemetery, where he appeared at a ceremony honoring troops killed in the evacuation.

26,"PHILADELPHIA, United States (AFP) -- Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will clash in their first and possibly last televised debate Tuesday, in a potentially game-changing moment for the blockbuster 2024 US presidential election.

The stakes could hardly be higher for the Democratic vice president and Republican former president as tens of millions of American voters tune in to see them finally face off.

A single zinger or gaffe could tip the balance of one of the most dramatic White House races in US political history, with the two rivals neck-and-neck in the polls with less than two months until election day.

For Harris, 59, it will be a critical chance to win over voters who still know little about her, as her honeymoon starts to fade after suddenly replacing President Joe Biden in July.

Trump, 78, will meanwhile try to box in Harris on issues like the economy and immigration, but may also unleash more of the racist and sexist insults that he's directed her way during the campaign.

The two candidates will also be meeting in person for the first time at the ABC News debate in Pennsylvania, adding to the potential for a bruising confrontation.

""This debate may go down in the history books. Break out the popcorn,"" said Andrew Koneschusky, a former press secretary for US Senate leader Chuck Schumer.

Harris, America's first female, Black and South Asian vice president, arrived in Philadelphia on the eve of the ABC News debate after five days holed up in a hotel doing intense practise sessions.

One of her aides even reportedly dressed up in a Trump-style boxy suit and long tie so she could get used to unloading her best lines on her opponent.

Trump's team said he has taken a more relaxed approach ahead of his seventh presidential debate, choosing to arrive in Philadelphia just hours before and keeping his preparations limited.

Harris in many ways has the most to prove at the debate. She will be under pressure to spell out her so-far vague policy manifesto to voters, who according to The New York Times poll said they need to know more about her.

Former reality TV star Trump is by far the more experienced presidential debater, with six under his belt, but swing voters may be put off if he insults the candidate aiming to become America's first woman president."
27,"(The Center Square) - Former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s win at the appellate level has been supported by the state Supreme Court 4-3 and he will not appear on North Carolina ballots.

That makes five out of seven battleground states where voters will no longer see his name at the election booth.

More than 2.9 million ballots had already been printed, with better than 136,000 requests for absentee ballots that had been scheduled to go into the mail this past Friday. Kennedy's name is now off five of seven consensus battleground states, with another decision expected Tuesday.

Justices in favor of him staying off the ballot were Chief Justice Paul Newby, Phil Berger Jr., Tamara Barringer and Trey Allen; in dissent were Anita Earls, Richard Dietz and Allison Riggs. The decision affirms last week's ruling by the North Carolina Court of Appeals.

Counties pay for the costs. The State Board of Elections has responsibility to recode the 2,348 different ballot styles statewide for the 2024 general election.

Karen Brinson Bell, executive director for the board, has previously instructed the 100 county boards of election to await mailing any absentee ballots until a date can be set for all. She said it is hoped to meet a Sept. 21 federal deadline.

Kennedy, nephew of former President John F. Kennedy and former U.S. Sen. Ted Kennedy, was to be on the ballot as representative of the We The People Party. The Democratic Party, on July 26, filed a lawsuit to reverse the state board's decision to allow him onto the ballot.

On Aug. 23, Kennedy suspended his campaign and began to request his name be taken off ballots in the battleground states. He subsequently endorsed Republican former President Donald Trump against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.

North Carolina is among the seven battleground states representing 93 electoral college votes. Pennsylvania has 19, North Carolina and Georgia 16 each, Michigan 15, Arizona 11, Wisconsin 10 and Nevada six.

In Michigan on Monday, the state Supreme Court reversed a lower court ruling and his name will appear on ballots. A ruling is expected on Tuesday in Wisconsin. In other battleground states, he is not on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Georgia or Pennsylvania.

According to published reports, he will also not appear on the ballot in Ohio, Florida, South Carolina, Virginia, New York, New Hampshire or Maine. He is on the ballot in Washington, Oregon, California, Alaska, Hawaii, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, Delaware and Vermont."
28,"WASHINGTON -- As Congress returned from a five-week recess Monday, House Republicans attached a provision to bar noncitizens from voting in federal elections -- which is already unlawful -- to a stopgap funding bill that is already teeing up a battle with the Senate and White House.

The GOP drive in Congress echoes state lawmakers' push for ballot measures this November that would bar noncitizens from voting in Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wisconsin.

It also comes in the heat of the presidential campaign, as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump repeatedly calls for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants and faces the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, in a crucial Tuesday night debate.

Current federal government spending will expire Oct. 1, so Congress must pass a continuing resolution, or CR, to approve temporary spending beyond that date or risk a shutdown.

The measure that requires proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections, which U.S. House Republicans and some vulnerable Democrats passed in July, has been added by the House GOP to a CR that would extend spending until March 28. A vote by the House is expected this week.

The White House on Monday vowed President Joe Biden would issue a veto if Congress passed the measure in that form.

""Instead of meeting the security and disaster needs of the Nation, this bill includes unrelated cynical legislation that would do nothing to safeguard our elections, but would make it much harder for all eligible Americans to register to vote and increase the risk that eligible voters are purged from voter rolls,"" the White House said in a statement Monday. ""It is already illegal for noncitizens to vote in Federal elections -- it is a Federal crime punishable by prison and fines.""

Senate opposition

The voting language is a nonstarter among Senate Democrats, who hold a slim majority in the chamber.

""As we have said repeatedly, avoiding a government shutdown requires bipartisanship, not a bill drawn up by one party,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Patty Murray of Washington said in a joint statement Friday.

""If Speaker Johnson drives House Republicans down this highly partisan path, the odds of a shutdown go way up, and Americans will know that the responsibility of a shutdown will be on the House Republicans' hands,"" they continued.

Democrats have argued that the bill is an attempt to sow distrust in U.S. elections ahead of November elections.

House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana has stressed that noncitizen voting in federal elections is an issue, although research has found it rarely happens.

""As the 2024 election nears, it is imperative that Congress does everything within our power to protect the integrity of our nation's election system,"" he said in a statement.

The bill is also supported by Trump.

In April, Johnson while at Trump's residence in Palm Beach, Florida, announced the House would pass a bill relating to noncitizen voting. The former president has often falsely blamed voting by large numbers of undocumented people for his 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton as the reason he lost the popular vote.

Other Democrats objected to passing a CR that would last until next year.

The top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, criticized the six-month measure because it is ""shortchanging veterans and jeopardizing their care by kicking the can down the road until March.""

""A continuing resolution to the end of March provides Republicans with more leverage to attempt to force their unpopular cuts to services that American families depend on to make ends meet,"" she said in a statement.

Texas congressman spearheads bill

The original noncitizen voting bill, H.R.8281, was first introduced by Texas GOP Rep. Chip Roy, a member of the far-right House Freedom Caucus. It passed 221-198, with five Democrats voting with Republicans, but stalled in the Senate.

Those five Democrats who voted in support of the measure are: Reps. Jared Golden of Maine, Henry Cuellar of Texas, Donald Davis of North Carolina, Vicente Gonzalez of Texas and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington.

Under current U.S. law, only citizens can vote in federal elections, but the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 prohibits states from confirming citizenship status.

Along with the ballot measures, hundreds of Republican state legislators have also signed on to a letter by the Only Citizens Vote Coalition urging Congress to pass a bill to bar noncitizens from voting in federal elections.

The Only Citizens Vote Coalition includes election denier activists, organizations headed by former Trump aides and anti-immigrant groups. It was founded by Cleta Mitchell, a key figure who tried to overturn the 2020 presidential election and is now running a grassroots organization to aggressively monitor elections in November.

Five of the eight states -- Idaho, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wisconsin -- with votes set on ballot measures have state legislators who sponsored bills to put the question on the ballot and are signed on to the letter by Only Citizens Vote."
29,"(Editor's Note: The following opinion column does not constitute an endorsement of any political party or candidate, on the part of Newsmax.)

Former President Donald Trump said in an interview with the Washington Examiner that his message to undecided voters in Pennsylvania ahead of November's general election is that his administration would bring prosperity to Pennsylvanians through common-sense approaches to energy, border security and strengthening manufacturing.

""We are going to bring the cost down on energy, and that is going to bring down the cost of everything,"" Trump said.

The former president added that he wants voters to know he would take the country to a better place not just on costs but on the massive influx of illegal immigrants who have crossed the southern border since the beginning of the Biden-Harris administration.

Data from the Department of Homeland Security showed encounters with illegal immigrants at the southern border soared after President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris entered the White House, with at least 6.5 million migrants crossing the border in that time frame.

""They have taken over our cities,"" Trump said in reference to the increase in crime in the United States.

Trump was in Johnstown, a once-mighty manufacturing city located in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, just two days after Harris sat down with CNN host Dana Bash for her first interview in the 39 days since Biden was pushed out of the race and Harris was named the Democratic presidential nominee.

In the interview, Harris dismissed the notion that she would ban fracking and stated that she said so in her debate with former Vice President Mike Pence in 2020. But a quick read of the transcript shows Harris only said Biden would not ban fracking. She did not mention her viewpoint.

Harris followed up her fracking claim by quickly saying her values on climate change have remained the same.

Trump questioned why, if Harris is so supportive of fracking, she hasn't lifted the pause on exports of liquid natural gas that Biden placed on the industry.

""I would lift that immediately,"" Trump said. ""I would get rid of everything that she's done.""

Trump said Harris is accountable for everything that has happened in the Biden-Harris administration, especially because Biden made a point of saying Harris was always the last person in the room with him on big and small decisions.

""Oh, she is totally accountable. She sat in every meeting. She was responsible for what happened in Afghanistan,"" Trump said of the chaotic exit.

""I look forward to debating her,"" he added after watching her interview.

Within minutes after the Examiner interview, Trump walked onto the stage at the Cambria County War Memorial Arena, where the iconic hockey movie ""Slap Shot"" was filmed, and spoke to a packed crowd of supporters. Outside, a screen was set up for the overflow crowd that filled several blocks of the main street leading to the arena.

Trump began by saying, ""Starting on day one, I will seal the border. We will halt the invasion and deport the illegals.""

He then went on to say he would cut regulations that started under the Biden-Harris administration, unleash American energy production, cut consumer energy bills in half, and make the country a more affordable place to live.

Two days earlier, his vice presidential pick, Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, was in Erie County, New York. A week before that, he was in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania.

Trump has also been to Pennsylvania's Luzerne, York and Dauphin counties, all in an effort to shore up votes in the post-industrial communities outside the major cities of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.

Harris has been to western Pennsylvania twice. The first time, she visited one of her campaign field offices in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, and held a small, invite-only rally with union members at the airport.

The second visit was on Labor Day, when she joined Biden at another invite-only rally, with approximately 500 people, at a union hall in Pittsburgh.

Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn. Harris' running mate, to date, has had onlyone interview, the joint one he did with Harris on CNN.

The former high school teacher faced criticism in that interview for claiming ""his grammar isn't always good"" when trying to explain why he falsely said he had been in combat. Walz was never deployed in a war zone; however, he was deployed to Italy.

Between 1992 and 2016, every Democratic candidate running for president won Pennsylvania. In 1996, former President Bill Clinton won by capturing 28 of the state's 67 counties.

What was missed between that year and 2012 was that the state was slowly moving right by 0.04 percentage points every four years. Former President Barack Obama won Pennsylvania in 2012 by only 13 of the state's 67 counties.

The next 2016 Republican nominee only had to gin up approximately 2,000 more votes in the 10 rural post-industrial counties such as Luzerne, Erie, Cambria and Westmoreland. It didn't matter what happened in the heavily populated counties of Allegheny and Philadelphia.

Instead, what mattered was the counties that Hillary Clinton, former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential nominee, failed to visit.

Trump went on to win the 2016 presidential election by gaining those counties. The fact that Pennsylvania had been trending right wasn't the only thing missed. It was that the coalitions of both parties had changed.

Obama had shed the New Deal Democrats from his coalition in 2012, which is why he won the state by fewer voters than he did in 2008. And Trump's constant talk about the dignity of work and showing up in places no candidate typically does paid off.

Four years later, Biden picked off just enough of those heirloom Democrats to narrowly defeat Trump in 2020.

Polling shows Trump and Harris in a statistical tie in the state. At this same time in 2016 and 2020, both Hillary Clinton and Biden held leads over Trump, with Clinton eventually losing to him in Pennsylvania and Biden barely winning the state.

One key rule that the Harris camp tried hard to was the muting of the microphone of the candidate after they were through with the allotted speaking time. Harris's camp wanted the microphones to be left on for the entire duration of the debate because Trump has a tendency to interrupt and talk over the other person as he did famously in the first debate with Biden in 2020.

Trump stood his ground and, the muting rule stayed. The candidates will not make opening statements.

The ABC News debate is scheduled to last for 90 minutes and will be held without an audience."
32,"WASHINGTON - Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican US presidential candidate Donald Trump are preparing to meet for the first time in their only scheduled debate, a clash that could prove pivotal in their pitched battle for the White House.

The nationally televised debate, beginning at 8am Wednesday Thailand time, takes place just eight weeks before the Nov 5 election. The race is a close one that could easily swing in either direction and early voting will start in some states in the coming days.

The encounter is particularly important for Harris, with opinion polls showing that more than a quarter of likely voters feel they do not yet know enough about her, in contrast to the well-known former president.

The debate offers Harris, a former prosecutor, a chance to make her case against Trump, whose felony convictions, outspoken backing for supporters convicted in the Jan 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and frequent falsehoods offer plenty of fertile ground.

It will be the first time the two candidates have met and follows weeks of personal attacks on Harris by Trump and his allies that have included racist and sexist insults.

A similar outburst on stage could turn off undecided voters, according to John Geer, a professor at Vanderbilt University and an expert on presidential politics.

Harris is prepared for the possibility.

""Donald Trump has a real problem with the truth,"" she wrote in an X post Tuesday morning that was echoed in ""Crowd Size"", a campaign ad featuring former president Barack Obama ridiculing Trump's false claims about crowd sizes at his events.

Harris will discuss the economy and her plans for bringing down food and housing prices, her campaign advisers said.

Trump's advisers and fellow Republicans have urged him to focus on Tuesday on illegal immigration and high prices, issues that play well with voters, and on portraying Harris as too liberal for the country.

Lara Trump, the candidate's daughter-in-law, said Trump had prepared for the debate. ""He's ready to talk about why your life was better when he was in office,"" she said on CNN.

Presidential debates do not necessarily change voters' minds, but they can transform the dynamics of a race. President Joe Biden's performance against Trump in June was so damaging that it eventually led him to abandon his campaign.

In a contest that could again come down to tens of thousands of votes in a handful of states, even a small shift in public opinion could alter the outcome. The two candidates are effectively tied in the seven battleground states likely to decide the election, according to polling averages compiled by the New York Times.

""There is more for Kamala Harris to gain and more for her to lose,"" since she remains less known to many voters, said Mitchell McKinney, a former adviser to the US Commission on Presidential Debates.

Viewers will be looking for where she stands on various issues. But just as important, they will be looking to see how she handles herself against Trump.

Trump, by contrast, is already well defined. ""You're either for him or against him"" at this point, McKinney said.

The 90-minute debate, hosted by ABC News, will take place at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. As agreed by the campaigns, there will be no live audience and microphones will be muted when it is not a candidate's turn to speak.

Harris has been preparing in Pittsburgh since Thursday, holding mock sessions on a stage with lights to recreate the debate environment.

Rather than rehearsing, Trump has relied on informal chats with advisers, campaign appearances and media interviews to get set for Tuesday, with former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard -- who had a memorably hostile exchange with Harris in a Democratic presidential debate in 2019 -- offering advice.

On a call with reporters, Gabbard said Trump would treat Harris just as any other opponent.

""President Trump respects women and doesn't feel the need to be patronising or to speak to women in any other way than he would speak to a man,"" she said. ""He is speaking to Kamala Harris' record, and comparing and contrasting that with his record of success.""

While any personal crossfire will get plenty of attention, the two rivals are also likely to skirmish over several major issues.

A Harris campaign official said the vice president is expected to hammer Trump on abortion and describe him as unfit to lead.

Abortion has been a top issue for Harris and Democrats since 2022, when the US Supreme Court -- powered by three Trump appointees -- eliminated a nationwide right to the procedure in a broadly unpopular decision.

Harris has also sought to tie Trump to Project 2025, a conservative blueprint from the Heritage Foundation think tank that proposes expanding executive power, eliminating environmental regulations and making it illegal to ship abortion pills across state lines, among other right-wing goals.

Trump has offered shifting rhetoric on abortion while distancing himself from Project 2025, even though many of his former advisers were involved in drafting proposals.

For his part, Trump will tie Harris to the Biden administration's immigration policy, attacking them for record levels of migrant crossings before a recent spate of executive orders drove the numbers down dramatically.

He is expected to highlight Harris' past support -- since disavowed -- for left-wing stances such as banning fracking, portraying her either as a flip-flopper or an extreme liberal in disguise."
33,"PHILADELPHIA -- Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will be face-to-face for the first time during Tuesday night's debate in Philadelphia, marking a pivotal moment during the final sprint of a razor-thin race for the White House.

""We have said over and over again the stakes cannot be higher,"" said Allison Prasch, an expert on U.S. presidential rhetoric at the University of Wisconsin.

A Pew Research Center survey released on Monday suggests the presidential race is deadlocked. It found about half of registered voters -- 49 per cent -- said they would vote for Harris if the election were held today, and an identical share said they would back Trump.

The report, based on a survey conducted from Aug. 26 to Sept. 2, found Trump's advantage is on the economy, with the majority of voters saying they are very or somewhat confident the former president would make good decisions about economic policy."

35,"Source: United States House of Representatives - Congressman Jerrold Nadler (10th District of New York)

WASHINGTON, DC - Today, Ranking Member Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) delivered the following opening statement, as prepared, for the House Judiciary Committee Hearing on ""The Biden-Harris Border Crisis: Victim Perspectives"":

""Mr. Chairman, before I start, I would like to take a moment and express my sincerest condolences to all of our witnesses who have lost loved ones, and to all of their families. I cannot imagine how difficult this loss has been for you, and I appreciate your being here to share their stories. May their memories be a blessing.

Unfortunately, instead of working in a bipartisan fashion to find meaningful solutions to our broken immigration system, we are sitting in yet one more partisan hearing designed to divide us and to score political points before an election. In fact, one of our Republican colleagues said the quiet part out loud last week when he said, in this season, quote ""These are messaging [hearings] that we've been doing.""

With only eight weeks until election day, our Republican colleagues are trying to do everything they can to blame Vice President Harris for what they now call the ""Biden-Harris Border Crisis.""

They label her the ""border czar"" and the leader of the administration's border policy, even though they know that is not the case.

Let's be clear, Vice President Harris was never in charge of immigration policy for the Biden administration and was certainly not the ""border czar."" That position does not exist so, of course, she could not have been appointed to it. My Republican colleagues know this, of course, but have never let the facts get in the way of their messaging.

The truth is that President Biden directed Vice President Harris to address the root causes of migration from Mexico and the Northern Triangle. In that role, she generated over $5 billion in public and private investments aimed at creating economic opportunities in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras.

And that investment has paid major dividends -- between fiscal years 2021 and 2023, border patrol apprehensions of migrants from those countries dropped by nearly 50 percent.

That's because immigration is impacted by factors beyond one country's policies. People do not leave their lives and homes behind on a whim -- the people crossing our border immigrate because life has become unsustainable in their home countries, because of factors like persecution, or economic, food, or political insecurity. By investing in other countries, we help ensure that people can build a better life for themselves without having to seek security elsewhere.

These investments have contributed to the lowest levels of unauthorized crossings in four years. But you would not know any of that from seeing my colleagues do their press hits on Newsmax or from what we have heard today.

During today's hearing, we are going to hear from family members who have lost a loved one from fentanyl poisoning or as a result of a crime committed by someone who entered the country over the last four years. There is a verse in the Torah that hangs in my office: tzedek tzedek tirdof -- justice, justice shall you pursue.

The families here today want justice for their loved ones. They want to ensure that no other family has to suffer the pain of what they have gone through. These are noble goals. The heinous crimes these families have suffered should be universally condemned. The perpetrators should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of our laws and then they should be removed from the country.

But this is not a story that began four years ago. Tragically, the same story could be told of any president. Even former President Trump's administration released undocumented immigrants who went on to commit crimes.

Now, do I blame President Trump for those crimes? Of course not. He has his own crimes to worry about. And, as I have said all Congress, no president has ever had the resources to detain every individual who crosses the border without authorization. Our immigration system is broken, and it will take a substantial bipartisan effort to fix it.

We need more judges and asylum officers so migrants can have their asylum case heard in a matter of weeks not years. We need to expand lawful pathways for migration, as the Biden-Harris administration has been trying to do, so people can come to the United States after they are vetted in an orderly and safe manner.

And we need to look at immigration in a holistic manner, to see the benefits that immigrants bring to this country, and not focus only on the negatives.

Immigrants' contributions have helped ensure that we came out of the pandemic stronger than any other advanced economy. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that recent immigrants will cut the deficit by $900 billion and add revenues of $1.2 trillion over the next decade. Immigrants make essential contributions to our society, our economy, and our character as a country. And they do so despite an immigration system that has been profoundly broken for decades.

But, all Congress, my Republican colleagues have shown they do not have interest in fixing the system so that we may take advantage of the remarkable contributions that immigrants make to our country while keeping out those who would do us harm. Instead, they would rather blame Democrats and push unworkable solutions.

Republicans spent a year saying that their dream bill, H.R. 2, is the only way to secure the border, even though they know that it cannot become law, having failed twice to pass the Senate, receiving just 32 votes earlier this Congress.

Then they insisted that the price of helping protect Ukraine against Russian aggression was enacting harsh border enforcement legislation. Senate Republicans even managed to find bipartisan support for a border bill in the Senate, a bill that Minority Leader McConnell called the toughest border bill in 30 years.

But Republicans could not take yes for an answer.

Donald Trump said that he did not want to do anything that might help at the border in an election year, because he wants immigration as a campaign issue. Other Republicans said it out loud too: saying they don't want to ""do too damn much to help a Democrat.""

Republicans showed clearly what Democrats have been saying over and over again -- that they don't want to do anything that would help address our immigration system. They clearly have given up.

I wish that was not the case. Vice President Harris has made it clear we need a reformed immigration system with robust lawful pathways to citizenship, strong security and controls at our border, and a modern approach to a global issue that has been neglected for far too long. Democrats stand ready to work on real solutions to these problems. I only wish we had a willing partner.

I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today and I yield back."""
36,"CHICAGO -- For Christopher Pugh, the 2020 election was a turning point.

He already distrusted the government. But as he watched Fox News coverage in the immediate aftermath of the election and read posts on Twitter, the social media platform now known as X, that distrust grew. He now believes the falsehood that the 2020 election was stolen and trusts few people other than former President Donald Trump to deliver him news about election results.

""I trust Donald Trump, not the government,"" said the 38-year-old Republican from Gulfport, Mississippi. ""That's it.""

While most Americans trust government-certified election results at least a ""moderate"" amount, Republicans are more likely to trust Trump and his campaign, according to a new survey from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and USAFacts. Americans also are heading into the November election with concerns about misinformation. Many have low trust that the information they receive from presidential candidates -- particularly Trump, but also Vice President Kamala Harris -- is based on factual information.

Trump continues to lie about the outcome of the 2020 election, saying it was rigged against him even after dozens of his court challenges failed, reviews, recounts and audits in battleground states all affirmed President Joe Biden's win, and Trump's own attorney general said there was no evidence of widespread fraud. Despite no evidence of any widespread fraud, a 2023 poll found that most Republicans believe Biden was not legitimately elected president.

As Trump runs as the Republican candidate for the third time, he also is signaling that he can only lose through widespread fraud. Over the weekend he threatened to prosecute those ""involved in unscrupulous behavior"" this election should he win in November.

""The only way they can beat us is to cheat,"" Trump said at a Las Vegas rally in June.

The recent findings from the AP-NORC survey show that a significant chunk of Trump's supporters might be more inclined to believe what he says about the upcoming election results than they are to trust government certifications of election results.

About two-thirds of Republicans trust Trump's campaign at least a moderate amount to provide accurate information about the results of the 2024 election, while only about half say the same about the official certifications of results, the survey found. By contrast, about 9 in 10 Democrats trust the government certification at least a moderate amount, and an overwhelming majority, 82%, also have at least a moderate amount of trust in Harris and her campaign.

Most Americans -- around 7 in 10 -- trust the government certifications of election results at least a moderate amount, according to the survey. Majorities also trust national and local TV news networks, as well as local or national newspapers, to provide accurate information about the outcome of this year's presidential election.

Danielle Almeida, a 45-year-old Democrat from Briarcliff Manor, New York, said she trusts government-certified election results and finds it alarming that some Americans don't.

""In order to have a democracy, we have to trust the system and the results of our elections,"" she said, adding that she thinks Trump ""does not care about fact-checking because he believes his supporters don't care, either.""

Americans are less likely to trust the campaigns overall -- compared to sources such as the government and the media -- but they have a higher level of trust in Harris and her campaign than in Trump and his campaign to provide accurate information about the outcome of the election. About half have at least a ""moderate"" amount of trust in Harris and her campaign. By contrast, about 4 in 10 have at least a moderate amount of trust in Trump and his campaign.

Some Republicans' distrust of election results started far before the 2020 election.

Richard Baum, 60, a conservative independent from Odessa, Texas, said his suspicions began in the 2000 U.S. presidential race between George W. Bush and Al Gore. After Bush won by a slim margin, ""hanging chads"" became an unlikely symbol of a disputed presidential election as small anomalies common in elections ballooned into major national controversies.

""There was some stuff there that didn't seem right that made a lot of doubts in my mind about if you can trust the government,"" Baum said.

Baum said he would trust election results only if voting took place on only a single day, early voting and mail-in ballots were banned and photo IDs were required at all polling places.

Many Americans doubt the veracity of both presidential candidates' campaign messages, but skepticism about Trump's campaign is higher, the USAFacts/AP-NORC survey found.

Related Story: Trump and Harris Neck and Neck After Summer Upheaval, Times/Siena Poll Finds

About 6 in 10 Americans believe that Trump's campaign messages are ""rarely"" or ""never"" based on factual information, compared to 45% who say that about Harris' campaign messages.

Many Americans also say it's hard to discern fact from fiction when it comes to the candidates. Slightly less than half of Americans say it's ""very easy"" or ""somewhat easy"" to find factual information about the candidates and their positions, and only about one-third say it's easy to know if what candidates are saying is true or not.

About 6 in 10 Americans say it's easy for them to understand the difference between fact and opinion when it comes to information about the upcoming presidential election, but only about 4 in 10 say it's easy to know whether information is true or not.

Americans are, however, more confident about factual information related to election logistics: About 7 in 10 Americans say it's easy to find information about how to register to vote, and about 6 in 10 say it's easy to find information about how to cast their ballot.

Michele Martin, a 56-year-old Pennsylvania Democrat, said she is ""very concerned"" about misinformation from politicians but finds it much easier to access basic voter information.

""It's online. It's mailed to you. It's not hard to find,"" she said.

Related Story: Former Project 2025 Leader Accuses Trump Campaign Advisers of 'Malpractice'

About 8 in 10 Americans say that when it comes to getting information about the government, the spread of misinformation is a ""major problem."" That is essentially unchanged from when the question was asked in 2020.

Lisa Kuda, a 57-year-old Republican from Palm Harbor, Florida, said she gets most of her news from social media and friends. She said she feels alienated from most news sources other than Fox News.

""Misinformation is everywhere,"" she said. ""It's really difficult to find information about candidates.""

When Americans see news about the election and want to find out whether it's true, 40% say they turn to an internet search first. Much smaller shares -- around 1 in 10 for each -- say they first check cable news, national TV news or social media.

Related Story: Trump Threatens to Jail Political and Other Opponents

Baum, from Texas, said he finds it difficult to easily access information about candidates because he believes social media platforms ""are censoring conservative ideologies."" He also doesn't trust Google and instead turns to conservative networks and podcasts such One America News and conservative podcasters to fact-check claims he's unsure about.

Almeida's process looks much different. She starts with a Google search and wades through multiple articles from news outlets such as The New York Times and NBC News, making note of any differences. If multiple articles have the same information, she said, she's more likely to trust it.

""Misinformation is a huge problem,"" she said. ""You have to take time to do your research."""
37,"PHILADELPHIA (CBS) -- The 2024 election will be the first time many college students will cast a ballot in a national political race.

As Vice President Kamala Harris prepares to take on former President Donald Trump on the debate stage at the National Constitution Center, universities around the Philadelphia area are planning to use it as a teachable moment.

Widener University is one of a number of schools across our region hosting watch parties.

Senior Taylor Easter says her peers are looking forward to hearing from candidates regarding issues that are close to their communities.

""I think people are interested in hearing about gun control and reproductive justice,"" Easter said. ""In general there's concern about partisanship, whether or not we are able to have civil conversations with each other.""

Widener is also helping students get registered and ready to vote.

Tonight's watch party is inside Lathem Hall where students will begin arriving before 9 p.m.

First-year student Ryan Francis is majoring in communications. He one day hopes to become a journalist. He says he's hoping to hear the candidates stance on student loans.

""I like to have money and I'd like to hear their stances because I haven't heard a ton from both of them yet,"" Francis said.

Following tonight's debate will be student-facilitated discussions.

Temple University is also planning a watch party on campus.

""This is a very important election of course, but also recognizing that a lot of our students are voting for the very first time,"" David Brown, assisant dean of community and communication, said in a live interview Tuesday morning.

""Our campaign called Temple Votes is really focused on being able to have voter education, engagement and hopefully, registration. That students who are not registered will be able to be informed to get registered,"" Brown added."
38,"CLEVELAND, Ohio - Springfield officials are refuting unsupported claims about migrants committing crimes after U.S. Sen. JD Vance and other conservative political influencers made accusations that went viral on social media.

We're talking about the baseless accusations about refugees killing ducks and eating pets on Today in Ohio.

How did JD Vance, Dave Yost, Jon Husted and Donald Trump get it so wrong in widely publicizing a false claim about Haitian migrant crime - like the killing of ducks in parks -- in Springfield, Oh.

Is the state going to spend $400,000 to circulate a flat-out lie about the anti-gerrymandering amendment on the November ballot?

Controversial Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson has a new accuser, but for the first time, the allegation is rape. What does his accuser say happened and how might this figure into his future in Cleveland?

How are the political campaigns getting all of our cellphone numbers and bombarding us with text messages begging us for money? Is there anything we can do about it?

Did Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost ask Ohio Supreme Court Justice Pat DeWine to recuse himself a few years ago from the redistricting case in which DeWine's dad, the governor, was a key player? Nope. So how does he justify seeking the recusal of another justice in a case that also involves redistricting?

Does Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose have two standards for making decisions on candidates being on the ballot, including one for white males like himself? How does he justify his decision to keep someone on the ballot who failed to disclose a name change, as state law requires?

U.S. Sen. JD Vance and some colleagues took a loss in a US Appeals Court in Cincinnati, even though judges seemed to agree with what Vance argued. This involves campaign spending. What's the case about?

We could be having an adult conversation in Ohio about how to accommodate legal immigration, but no, no, JD Vance, Dave Yost, Donald Trump, Bernie Moreno are turning it into absolute nonsense that crowds out the facts. The first story we're talking about on Today in Ohio, the news podcast discussion from Cleveland .com and the Plain Dealer.

having an adult conversation in Ohio about how to accommodate legal immigration. But no, no, JD Banks, Dave Joseph, Donald Trump, Bernie Moreno are turned into absolute nonsense and crowds out in the back. The first story we're talking about on Today in Ohio is a new podcast extension from Keeley .com and The Great Day. This week, we're going to some guys who are

I'm Chris Quinn. I'm here with Lisa Garvin, Laura Johnston and Leila Tasi. And let's get to that story. How did JD Vance, Davios, John Husted and Donald Trump get it so wrong in widely publicizing a false claim about Haitian migrant crime like the killing of ducks in parks in Springfield, Ohio, Laura?

My guess is that they wanted to believe it, so they didn't check their facts. These claims circulated in right wing social media circles. Republicans in Ohio, around the country, are trying to make illegal immigration a cornerstone campaign in November, even though illegal immigration is not really a big problem in Ohio. But I guess if you can say, hey, Haitian immigrants, migrants, refugees are killing ducks in public parks, then we're going to try to make it an Ohio issue.

But the Springfield city manager is really trying to quell this and saying there have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals in the immigrant community. There are no verified instances of immigrants engaging in any illegal activities such as squatting or littering in front of residents' home. No reports on deliberately disrupting traffic. So apparently these are the rumors that have been circulating.

City manager is saying, not true. They're talking about these Haitian immigrants, 12 to 15 '000 of them who are there under a federal refugee program can be in the country legally until at least 2026. But does that stop JD Vance from posting about it on X? No, he says, months ago, I raised the issue of Haitian illegal immigrants draining social services and generally causing chaos, chaos all over Springfield, Ohio. Reports now show that people have their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn't be in this country.

Where is our borders are? mean, I don't even see the eaten one is just like, my gosh.

What's sad is this is the way the system is supposed to work. We're a country that does bring in people who are in danger elsewhere. And in Haiti, life is cheap. People are getting slaughtered. So this is not illegal. This isn't the loose border. This was by design. And by all accounts, it's going pretty well. The city's only point is this is a 30 % increase roughly in our population. We don't have the

comparable increases in our police and fire department, and that's not in our budget, so we could use some help from the federal government as we accommodate this. Perfenically reasonable, sober conversation we should be having. If we move a bunch of refugees into a city, there should be assistance to that city to accommodate it. But these guys have turned it into utter nonsense. Where does mature conversation go anymore?

Well, and so President Donald Trump, their campaign, cited the Daily Mail, which cited an unsupported statement during a city commission meeting. There were also people, I kid you not, quoting an anonymous Facebook post that described a neighbor's daughter's friend who discovered their cat had been strung up. Who would buy that? That is the most asinine, far -flated, I don't know. You just can't make this stuff up.

Well, it's sad because these are people who are our leaders or want to be leaders. And what you count on in leaders is thoughtful discussion, thoughtful approaches. And they're just ridiculous, flame throwing liars, yet again, telling big lies to scare the hell out of the population. You know what their problem is? They keep trying to convince everybody that immigration is a big problem. And in Ohio, that's not what people are talking about.

They're talking about childcare. They're talking about grocery prices. They're talking about the cost of college tuition. They're talking about paycheck to paycheck living. We don't have an immigration problem in Ohio as much as Bernie Moreno, who's an immigrant, I should point out, is trying to convince us. We do have an immigration problem in Ohio. It's Bernie Moreno.

Right, we are really far from the Mexican border in Ohio. We have a Canadian border. I am a Canadian immigrant, but as far as I know, nobody's pointing fingers at the Canadians saying they're causing problems. But that doesn't stop.

Well, I kind of point the finger at a Canadian and say she's causing problems.

general, just one specific one. But Attorney General Dave Yost, I mean, he's jumping in on this. This is the top law enforcement person official in our state. And he's putting out these statements that say migrants are causing car crashes, stealing property, including livestock. How much livestock is in Springfield, Ohio? It's a city. I don't know that there are cows in the backyard, squatting in homes and killing wildlife for food.

The problem is not migrants. It's way too many migrants in a short period of time, a massive increase in the population without any communication or assistance from the federal government. And that's where it is, right? Because they're going to blame the federal government here. So they can point fingers at Biden and the Democratic president and say it's all their fault. That's why we need Trump in the White House.

Don't you think Dave Yost would have learned his lesson about jumping on bogus news with the seven year old, yeah, the 10 year old abortion, you know, when he cast doubts that she even existed. You'd think that he'd say, wait, wait, wait, before I start throwing gasoline on the fire, maybe I should get my facts right. He was a journalist once, you know, you would think he would respect getting it right. You're listening to Today in Ohio.

Is the state going to spend $400 ,000 to circulate a flat out lie from Frank LaRose about the anti -gerrymandering amendment on our November ballot? Layla.

Well, that's very possible, Chris. The state has just approved spending that money on newspaper ads to, know, air quotes educate voters about issue one, which is the redistricting reform amendment. The state constitution requires the ads to run in newspapers in each of the state's 88 counties once a week in the three weeks before the November 5th election. Now, the ads will include the full ballot language.

along with the official arguments for and against the measure. But here's the kicker, the language for the amendment is still up in the air because there's a lawsuit pending about it and the Ohio Supreme Court hasn't made a final decision yet. And despite this legal limbo, the state had to approve the ad spending by a deadline this week. So the money's been approved, but they won't actually publish the ads until the court gives the go ahead. Democrats on the state controlling board, which is the group that voted on this,

tried to delay this decision until the court settled things, but Republicans on the board rejected that attempt at delay and went ahead with locking in the ad space anyway. And their reasoning was that it's better to be safe than sorry. We'll secure the ad space now and decide what goes in the ads later. But, you know, this is important because the language that's in dispute was written by the ballot board, which is run by Secretary of State, Frank LaRosa, Republican.

And the Democrats and backers of the amendment are concerned because they feel the current language was forced to mislead or it was misleading to voters by suggesting the amendment forces gerrymandering in favor of both Republicans and Democrats, even though it's actually meant to prevent gerrymandering. So we'll have to wait and see how the Supreme court rules on the ballot language before the ads go out.

You're being kind and saying suggesting they call this amendment gerrymandering, which is a flat out lie. We cannot stress that enough. That is a lie of the highest order. It's the opposite of gerrymandering. There is no definition of gerrymandering that would cover what this amendment does. That gerrymandering is where you skew the maps to favor one party over another. This amendment demands that you actually get the maps exactly proportional.

to how Ohio votes. The fact that the ballot board and Frank Larose shoved that lie in there, they should all be thrown out of their jobs. And I gotta tell you, if the Supreme Court approves that, everybody who goes to the polls this November should vote out whoever's in the Supreme Court because this cannot stand. It's a lie and it should not be put in front of the people of Ohio and everybody involved in it. The ballot board should be ashamed of itself.

for telling the people of Ohio that massive lie and they should not be spending nearly half a million dollars to spread it.

And know, Democrats are really worried that La Rose can't be trusted and that even if the court rejects the controversial ballot language, he might just go ahead and use it in the ads anyway. Do you think that that would be he would be so brazen as to use that language, even if the court rejects it?

I would not put anything past him. He is not in any way a servant to the public. He is a servant to the Republican Party and he breaks the rules to do it. I've never seen anybody operate like him. It's every decision he makes is the opposite. We're going to be talking about another one in a few minutes. It's amazing how often he violates his oath to the people of Ohio by making contrary decisions. You're listening to Today in Ohio.

I'm going anything past that. He is not in any way a servant to the public. He is a servant to the Republican Party and to the race for the rule of I've never seen anything operate like this. It's every decision he makes, it's obvious. We're going be talking about another one in a few minutes. It's amazing how often he violates the rules of the people of Ohio by making these kinds decisions. I'm going be listening to Today in Ohio.

Controversial Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson has a new accuser and for the first time the allegation is actually rape. What does his accuser say happen Lisa and how might this figure into his future in Cleveland?

So the lawsuit was filed Monday in Harris County, Houston, Texas district court by Jane Doe. She accuses Watson of sexual assault and battery back in October of 2020.

Apparently they met in July of that year and then arranged a meeting later at her apartment. So he came over and she alleges in the suit that he took off his clothes almost immediately, laid down and demanded a massage. And she apparently complied. And then he pointed to his buttocks and says, I want you to massage my buttocks. At this point, the lawsuit said she was terrified. The filing also says she became, he became upset with the massage and then sexually assaulted her.

So apparently at some point she grabbed a heavy decor item that was sitting on the dresser and threatened him with it and told him to get out. And he did leave, he left enraged according to the lawsuit. She said in the suit that she was worried about reporting these allegations because of Watson's star status in Houston at the time. And since that she's been suffering panic attacks and nervous breakdowns. Her attorney is

Tony Busby of Houston. He's the man who represented the other two dozen women who had sexual harassment or assault claims against Watson. We reached out to Rusty Harden, another powerful Houston attorney who has represented Watson in these other cases. He's not listed as the attorney of record on this new case, so I don't know. We're waiting to hear.

We should point out that in a civil case, the standard that you must get across to a jury is a preponderance of evidence, unlike in a criminal case where it's beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no corresponding criminal charge. Busby said he doesn't know if to file a police report at this point. Because it's rape, though, I think in Houston, the statute of limitations are in Texas. It's five years. So it would still be within that window.

But it puts the Browns and the NFL in a challenging position. The rape allegation is a new one. And they are pretty strict with people who are accused of that kind of sexual violence. And I guess in some ways, they could banish him from playing, and the Browns could drop his contract under certain scenarios.

Well, and I haven't found any verification, but plenty of people said that there is an out in the Browns contract. I don't know the details of that. I don't know if it's true, but I mean, this could give them cause, I guess, to do something. I don't know.

Well, and we should remind everybody that Brown's owners, and Jimmy Haslam, knew of the previous allegations against the Sean Watson. But after talking to him, they said they felt comfortable with him. We'll see if they have the same comfort as this case continues.

Well, but let's not forget that those cases were all no -billed by two different grand juries in Houston. I just want to throw that out there. And I did find a quote, apparently Busby did talk to USA Today Sports. He says he's going to pursue this case aggressively and he wants a jury trial on this one.

He always says that, and then they settle. I think they settled every single case, didn't they?

My guess is that the Haslums are going to be less comfortable with this now that they realize how bad he sucks. If this gives him an out on that contract, let's see how they use this to their advantage.

Yeah, many, many people believe that the deal they made for him may be just the worst football deal ever made. it's saddled Cleveland with mediocrity for years. They gave up all their draft picks and brought in a guy who's not that good. So you're right, Laila. It might be interesting now that they know what his quality is, whether they're less willing to stand by his side. This all happens, of course, is they are trying to jack the public for $1 .2 billion for a stadium. You're listening to Today in Ohio.

How are the political campaigns getting all our cell phone numbers, Laura, and bombarding us with text messages begging and begging and begging us for money? And is there anything we can do about it?

No, not really. You can respond stop as much as you want and maybe that specific one will stop. But we're talking about a whole lot of different groups that have your number literally and it's legal and they can keep doing it. here's one I got. I was prepping for this podcast. came in. It said presidential straw poll before Kamala Harris hits the debate stage. Confirm you're voting for Harris, not Trump. It's reply here. I always delete these. I always say report junk.

I just keep going them. I get ones addressed to my husband, but apparently they're legal because they're considered manually sent and they proliferated since the 2021 US Supreme Court ruling. It loosened consent requirements for these mass texting systems. In the 2022 midterms campaigns and other political groups that more than 15 billion political texts. I can only imagine we're going up exponentially from there because these campaigns buy the list of potential

targets by from data brokers. They compile them from a combination of state voter records, third party consumer data, lists of verified cell phone numbers, and basically just data that you can buy for the right price. And they're trying to get small donations from people or to click on something to show that you are supporting. I don't know if I had clicked on that, what that would have done.

I got the same one. look, I'm overrun. I mean, I've gotten them every year and I've never donated to a political campaign and I'm a registered independent. I get them from Donald Trump, which is kind of funny because, you know, people know I think he's the worst human being ever to be on the political stage. But I got to say the Harris Walls campaign is by far, by far the worst I've ever seen. I've been hitting stop. I've been reporting junk.

Day after day after day I get multiple messages from them each day and I can't get them to stop I I wish there were a law but you know the lawmakers are the ones that pass these laws and so they exempt themselves But it causes serious resentment I don't want that junk in my phone and it just keeps coming and coming and it's don't you get the message? No go away

Right, I completely agree because your phone all of a sudden is like, your iCloud is full, your storage. it's like what? Because I have all these stupid text messages that I don't want in the first place. So that's why I've been deleting them as soon as they get in there so they don't take up space on my phone. But I guess they do this because it works. If it didn't work, they wouldn't do it. mean, is this going to change the way you vote? I mean, it's not going to change the way I vote. But I really do want to just tell them, I'm not going to spend money on you. I'm not going to support your campaign.

and you're really just annoying the heck out of people. You really want to like you.

But it's pathetic begging. It's like, hey, we only have 12 hours. The other side is doing X. We got 12 hours and you haven't given us anything. It's almost implying guilt because you haven't given anything. I think it builds resentment.

I think it does too. And quite honestly, all of my text messages have been Democrats. I mean, they must know I'm a Democrat or I voted Democrat because I've not gotten any Trump, no Moreno, no Republican ones at all. And as I said in the round table on Saturday, we talked about this and I'm like, we've been warned not to click on unsolicited texts. How do we know these are even legit?

Right. And I mean, that's not even talking about the email. I probably get more than 100 solicitations every day from all the campaigns. And I mean, part of that is being a reporter, right? You just get that stuff. But I wonder how many other people are getting this stuff every day. And you just want it to go away.

I wish tonight in the debate one of the questions would be you're annoying the hell out of America by begging them for money. Will you pledge to change the laws so you outlaw these text messages? Put them on the record.

If we do that, can we also talk about TV ads and emails? Because I just feel like you turn around and you're just bombarded.

You're listening to Today in Ohio. Did Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost ask Ohio Supreme Court Justice Pat DeWine to recuse himself a few years ago from the redistricting case in which DeWine's dad, the governor, was a key player? Nope. So, Layla, how does he justify seeking the recusal of a different justice in a separate party in a case that also involves redistricting?

This is becoming quite the legal showdown here. you're right, Chris, it seems really hypocritical for Yoast given the Pat DeWine situation from a while back. So Democratic State Supreme Court Justice Jennifer Bruner just rejected a request from Republicans to remove herself from the major redistricting lawsuit that was filed by citizens, not politicians, over the ballot language of this proposed amendment seeking to create the independent redistricting process. As we mentioned earlier, Republicans who control the Ohio ballot board

wrote the language in a way that says that the amendment requires gerrymandering, which is the exact opposite of what it's supposed to do. And Yost asked Bruner to step aside from this case because last year she filed a different lawsuit challenging a state law that involves Republican Secretary of State, Frank LaRose, who also happens to be tied to this redistricting lawsuit.

That other lawsuit was challenging a state law that requires judicial candidates to list their partisan affiliations on the ballot. So Yost's argument was that Bruner couldn't be impartial on this case. But on Monday, Bruner said, nope, there's no merit to that. And she's staying on the case. Specifically, she drew upon Yost's own arguments from the redistricting lawsuit when the Democratic minority on the ballot board filed arguments with the court independent of the Republican majority.

Yost tried to have those arguments struck from the record. He said the ballot board functions as a single unit and not as a collective of its individual members. So when Bruner wrote her letter rejecting this demand that she recuse herself, she said, hey, remember how you said the ballot board functions as a collective? Well, that flies in the face of your claim that I would be judging LaRose as an individual apart from that collective. I thought that was pretty brilliant. So Bruner's decision is obviously significant because

In past redistricting cases, the Democrats on the court have always kind of hung together. They've been on that side with the courts, four Republicans on the other.

Look, Pat DeWine's refusal to recuse himself in a case that could have held his dad in contempt was the height of hypocrisy on any court. There's no way that wasn't a conflict of interest. And our attorney general was silent on that. But here he is going after a Democratic justice on an issue that's so much more gray. It's hypocrisy, again, in our highest levels of office in Ohio.

You know, maybe I'm being Pollyanna about this, but this decision on the ballot language really seems about as cut and dried as it could possibly be, right? If the language that Lerose proposed says that the proposal would require gerrymandering, that couldn't be more patently false. This should be a unanimous decision on the court's part, regardless of party affiliation. you know, of course this is Ohio, so I guess anything can happen here.

Right, they should say it as clearly as possible and spank him and say, cut it out. Stop playing politics with your job. You're supposed to represent the citizens in elections matters and you represent everybody, not just people in your party. He's he's terrible. And we're to talk about him again in a minute. You're listening to Today in Ohio. Lisa does Ohio Secretary of State, Frank LaRose, have two standards for making decisions on candidates being on the ballot?

I should say it as clearly as possible and spank it. It's like cut it out, stop playing politics. You're supposed to represent its citizens in elections matters and you represent everybody, not just the people who party. He's terrible.

including one just for white males like himself. How does he justify his decision to keep someone on the ballot who failed to disclose a name change as state law requires?

So LaRose ruled that District 59 Republican State Representative Tex Fisher can remain on the

the Mahoning County November ballot, despite not listing a 2020 name change in his candidate paperwork. This would be in violation of an Ohio law that requires candidates to list all names they've used in the last five years, even though there's no space on the form to put those former names. So Fisher changed his legal name from Austin James Fisher to Austin James Texford Fisher.

The chair of the Mahoning County Democratic Party, Chris Anderson filed a complaint against Fisher. And then LaRose's ruling broke a two -two tie on the Mahoning County Board of Elections. which was a party line vote. The Dems were against or for it and the others were against it. But LaRose says the requirement only applies to statements of candidacy and nominating petitions.

Fisher got on the ballot because he was an appointee. He was appointed in June by the local Republican party to replace Al Cutrona, who resigned his seat in June for Ohio Senate appointment. So he didn't submit that paperwork because he was appointed. So I don't know, that sounds a little bit like weak sauce, but Fisher says it was really disheartening to deal with this petty, blatantly partisan stunt by the board.

He says it's overly harsh and unfair, and he would, if elected, introduce a bill to make it a penalty for not listing, to reduce the penalty for not listing previous names on the paperwork.

It is harsh and unfair, but it did take somebody off the ballot this year. I mean, how do you do two different standards? LaRose is using a technicality to take care of a Republican, but this is not right. You can't have separate standards. Somebody got yanked off the ballot because they were transgender who changed their name and didn't disclose it on the form, which doesn't have a place to disclose it.

and then they allow this guy to stay on it. doesn't make sense that we have the double standard. Frank Laroche had stepped in earlier and made sure the other candidate also could be on the ballot.

Well, I guess the only reason he stepped in was to break the tie because Vanessa Joy, the transgender Democratic candidate, was left off the District 50 primary ballot by the Stark County Board of Elections. But two other transgender candidates in other counties were allowed to stay on their ballot. And interestingly enough, Fisher actually supports, he says there was no clear intent to deceive voters in his case and Vanessa Joy's case. So he's kind of backing her up a little bit.

Yeah, I mean, the right thing is actually happening here. He shouldn't get kicked off the ballot, but Vanessa Joyce shouldn't have been kicked off the ballot either. That's where the wrong thing happened. You're listening to Today in Ohio. U .S. Senator JD Vance and some colleagues took a loss in a U .S. appeals court in Cincinnati, even though the judges seemed to agree with everything that Vance was arguing. All right, this is a complicated case involving campaign spending. Simplify it for us.

Okay, so this is about overturning federal limits on the political party's ability to coordinate the spending with the candidates. It's about how much the parties can give the candidates themselves in order to get elected. And this is the US Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. like you said, agreed with these plaintiffs, but they said, we can't overturn a 2001 Supreme Court ruling that upheld the limits, that that would have to come from the Supreme Court itself. These caps were established in 1972 in a campaign finance law.

And they're currently $32 million for a presidential candidate, $1 .1 million for a Senate candidate in Ohio. It differs in different states, $62 ,000 for a House candidate in Ohio. And while the Supreme Court overturned federal limits on overall party spending on candidates in 1996, then in 2001, they upheld these limits. They said that eliminating them would allow donors to circumvent federal limits and contribute to corruption, which...

We love to talk about corruption on this podcast. It just, I get what they're saying. I'm all for upholding campaign finance laws and making sure things are above board and that you're not swaying too much with the campaign money. But when we have dark money groups that can collect as much money and don't have to tell you where and can spend it on whatever candidate they want, it just seems like this is.

obsolete this limit in the face of what else is happening in campaign finance. Right.

which is what they argued and what the judges agreed to. They just said, we're not going to overrule the Supreme Court. They have to overrule themselves, tossing it up. So I'm sure it'll be appealed and there'll be some sort of decision that comes out of that.

And it'll be like, hey, give as much money as you want to these people and keep texting everybody you know.

You're listening to Today in Ohio. Well, do we finally have a date when that old Sheridan Hotel at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport is coming down to make way for much needed parking?

This place has been sitting vacant. It's in really rough shape for the past year. And demolition is finally set to begin on October 1st, and it could take up to four months to finish the job. The Sheraton opened way back in 1959, but its condition has gone downhill. Partly due to the pandemic's hit on travel, the city actually paid over $12 million last year to end the lease with the private company that ran the hotel. And it's been closed since May of 2022.

Now Cleveland based Bauman Enterprises will be handling the demolition for just over two million as part of a four million dollar contract to take down several buildings on airport property. So you know what's next for the site in the short term it's going to be turned into more parking. That's great news because parking at Hopkins has been tight lately. Air travels booming again with passenger numbers expected to hit over 10 million this year. That's the highest since 2008.

And unlike 2008 when Cleveland was a hub for continental airlines, most of those passengers now are starting or ending their trips in Cleveland, which really puts extra pressure on parking.

I don't remember, did it say exactly how many more spaces we'll get?

well, that's significant. I still don't understand why Cleveland tore down that other garage back when Frank Jackson was mayor that had tons of additional parking because it helped solve what was needed. But they tore that thing down without explaining it.

Yeah, seems like they're moving in the right direction of solving their parking problems. I there's talk of adding a second parking garage down the line, and they're giving travelers some relief on that. And you experience their smart par"
39,"Washington, Sep 10 (Prensa Latina) Democratic and Republican presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will face off today in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in a highly anticipated and potentially momentous debate for the U.S. elections in November.

Vice President Harris and former President Trump will attend the face-off presented by ABC News, at 21:00 Eastern local time, at the National Constitution Center. It will be the first time these two will meet in person.

Tonight's televised exchange is the only one scheduled between both rivals, ahead of the elections that will take place in less than two months, although early voting begins Sept. 16 in Pennsylvania, which will prove key in this election cycle, and in four other states later this month.

According to representatives of the Republican's team, ""we'll be ready tomorrow, President Trump will be ready. ""The question is whether Kamala Harris will be ready because she will have a lot of things to defend,""Jason Miller, senior advisor to the campaign stressed.

On the other hand, the Harris campaign launched a statement on Monday featuring several former Trump administration executives, including former Vice President Mike Pence and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, two critics of an eventual return of the tycoon to the White House.

The Democratic National Committee waved a banner over Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia prior to the division-leading Phillies game against the Tampa Bay Rays that read, ""Don't strike out on Trump, go to bat for Harris,"" local media report."
40,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (WBTV) - Millions of ballots must be reprinted for the 2024 general election in North Carolina after the state Supreme Court ordered Monday that former candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s name be removed.

North Carolina counties were supposed to begin sending out absentee ballots for this year's general election on Friday, Sept. 6. Counties were disrupted then by a court of appeals order requiring new ballots to be printed without Kennedy's name on them.

A legal battle over the removal of Kennedy's name began in late August after the former independent presidential candidate dropped out of the race.

On Aug. 29, the North Carolina State Board of Elections voted in favor of keeping Kennedy's name on the ballot due to the monetary and logistical challenges that reprinting would cause. Members of the elections board argued then that nearly 2 million ballots had already been printed across dozens of counties by that time, and to reprint them would take time and be costly to taxpayers.

It would take at least 13 days to reprint and redistribute ballots without Kennedy's name, according to Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the state's elections board.

Kennedy sued the state board of elections in an effort to get his name removed from the ballot. A Wake County Superior Court judge on Sept. 5 ruled against Kennedy, telling the state to continue with its plans to send out already-printed ballots.

Kennedy appealed that decision to the North Carolina Court of Appeals and won last Friday, just as absentee ballots were expected to start getting mailed out. The elections board appealed to the state Supreme Court, which ordered on Monday, Sept. 9 that Kennedy's name must be removed from North Carolina ballots.

As of Monday, more than 2.9 million ballots had already been printed statewide. All of those ballots must be reprinted without Kennedy's name.

Prior to the state Supreme Court's decision, the North Carolina Board of Elections said it was creating new ballot proofs to send to county elections boards in case a reprint became necessary.

""There are 2,348 different ballot styles statewide for the 2024 general election. More than 2.9 million ballots had already been printed before the order by the Court of Appeals,"" the board said Friday in a press release.

Election workers throughout the state had to grapple with last-minute delays related to processing and sending absentee ballots. The state's board of elections instructed counties to not send or reprint any ballots until the legal battle was sorted.

""Elections in North Carolina are constantly changing, so we're just accustomed to that, and just roll with it and do what we need to do,"" Kristin Holloway, director of Union County's board of elections, told WBTV last week.

---> Watch: North Carolina court battle over RFK Jr.'s name on ballot puts elections board in 'holding pattern'

There were about 3,000 requests for absentee ballots in North Carolina's Union County. In Mecklenburg County, where Charlotte is located, there were more than 100,000 absentee ballot requests.

Reprinting ballots without Kennedy's name will require extra work for many counties. According to Holloway in Union County, their board will have to talk to their vendors, get Kennedy's name removed, approve new ballots, reorder ballots, reprint them, redo their ""test deck,"" and then reprogram their equipment.

County boards were legally required to begin sending absentee ballots in the mail by Sept. 6, until the appellate court ruling.

Former independent candidate Kennedy initially fought to get his name on the ballot in North Carolina. In late August, however, he suspended his presidential campaign and endorsed the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump.

Typically, if a candidate drops out of a race with enough time before an election, their name won't get included on the ballot. Kennedy, however, suspended his campaign just before voting begins in North Carolina, creating a too-tight deadline for County Boards of Elections to remove his name without the legal battle that ensued.

Kennedy first joined the race as a Democratic candidate, but left the party last fall and chose to run independently. He's technically part of the new We the People Party that was formed earlier this year, and was eventually accepted as an official party by the North Carolina State Board of Elections.

The North Carolina Democratic Party challenged that board decision, but the challenge was rejected by the Wake County Superior Court. A state judge earlier this month refused to block the printing of Kennedy's name and other We the People Party candidates on North Carolina's presidential ballots.

Kennedy suspended his independent campaign in late August and endorsed Trump in the same breath. He said the decision was due to internal polls that showed his presence on the ballot would hurt Republican nominee Trump and benefit Democratic nominee and current Vice President Kamala Harris.

Polls at that time did not show that Kennedy would have a significant impact on support for either of the major-party candidates, however.

---> Harris-Trump presidential debate: How to watch on Sept. 10, 2024

North Carolina voters who requested an absentee ballot are not required to request a new one if they are to be reprinted, the state board said. Voters who have not yet requested an absentee ballot can still request one anytime before 5 p.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 29.

Absentee ballots must be received by the appropriate county board office by 7:30 p.m. on Election Day -- Nov. 5, 2024 -- in order to be counted.

The deadline to register to vote in North Carolina by mail is Oct. 11, 2024. Same-day voter registration is available, however, when voting in person, both on Election Day and during early in-person voting."
41,"WASHINGTON: Bogus stories that immigrants from Haiti are eating neighborhood pets and ducks from public parks in a mid-western US town exploded in public sphere on the eve of the Presidential debate on Tuesday as MAGA activists sought to put Kamala Harris on the back foot on the hot button immigration issue.

Sketchy reports and unsubstantiated rumors about grisly excesses by Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, had been circulating on the fringes of social media for days before Donald Trump, Elon Musk and other MAGA principals amplified it this week, adding to an already fervid tirade against illegal immigration.

Springfield, an Ohio town of around 50,000 people, is reported to have up to 15,000 immigrants under an Immigration Parole Program that gives them temporary protected status. Like with many small communities in the US which have had to host refugees and asylum seekers from across the world, there is an undercurrent of resentment among some locals who have had to share social services and foot the bill for taking care of them.

In an effort to tap into the resentment and fire up his nativist base, Trump has repeatedly invoked dodgy reports of Venezuelan gangs taking over apartment complexes in Colorado, warning his MAGA flock that soon their homes will be stolen from them. He now has a powerful ally in Musk, who, notwithstanding the fact that he is himself a South African immigrant, amplified several unsubstantiated reports about illegal aliens overrunning the country, eating everything from pet cats to bald eagles, and violently taking over American homes.

""Mad Max is becoming real fast,"" Musk said on Monday, in response to a post about Venezuelan gangs taking over a hotel in El Paso, Texas, referring to an Australian movie series about social collapse and dystopian future. Musk also argued that unchecked immigration into the US would result in perpetual one-party because immigrants would end up voting for Democrats.

Trump himself has repeatedly talked up another bogus story about American public schools forcibly subjecting children to sex change operations, wildly exaggerating the more accommodating Democratic position on LGBTQ rights. On Monday, his campaign gave credence to the grisly ""Haitians eating cats"" story with a social media post that read: ""President Trump will deport migrants who eat pets. Kamala Harris will send them to your town next. Make your choice, America.""

Trump's running mate JD Vance posted a video of himself discussing migration to Ohio at a recent hearing, saying, ""Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn't be in this country. Where is our border czar?""

The ""Haitians eating cats in Springfield"" rumor appeared to originate in an incident in Canton, Ohio, some 100 kms away, where a woman named Telia Ferrell was arrested for killing a cat. In video footage shared on social media, the police are heard asking her ""Did you eat that cat?"" without any response from the woman, who appears to be in a daze. Ferrell is said to be a US citizen with no links to Haiti.

The crude exercise of linking Harris to such incidents on the eve of the Presidential debate appear to be aimed at portraying her as a fifth columnist out to destroy America by streaming in millions of immigrants. The right wing echo chamber also circulated an unrelated clip of Harris saying the Biden administration has given Temporary Protection Status (TPS) to 100,000 Haitian migrants, linking it to unsubstantiated reports about pets being abducted for consumption.

Despite officials in Springfield clarifying that ""there have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community,"" Trump and his MAGA associates continue to whip up a frenzy, ostensibly in an effort to move the needle on the 2024 election that polls show the two candidates tied.

AI generated visuals of Trump coddling cats and ducks flooded the MAGA-sphere ahead of the debate on Tuesday. ""Please vote for Trump...so Haitian immigrants don't eat us,"" Republican Senator Ted Cruz said in one post."
42,"PHILADELPHIA -- Former President Donald Trump said that the biggest challenge in debating Vice President Kamala Harris Tuesday night will be the fact that over the years, she's shifted her positions on so many issues.

""You don't know what to expect. She's changed all of her policies over the years,"" Trump told NBC News in phone interview Tuesday morning.

He added, however, that he believes it makes it ""easier"" to define her in the minds of voters.

""It makes it much easier. She's no longer believable,"" Trump said.

The debate here Tuesday night, sponsored by ABC, is Trump's second of the 2024 election -- but his first against his new opponent. It's Harris' first general election debate as a presidential candidate ever.

Trump enters debate day feeling -- in his words -- ""great."" The former president's debate preparations have been far less extensive and structured than what Harris has been doing, but he participated in extensive sessions over the past two days, according to a source familiar.

Three sources who speak to Trump regularly, including one directly involved in the debate prep process, described Trump as either nervous or disengaged with debate preparation in the past few weeks. But that changed as the debate grew closer, and he's been much more dialed in.

The three sources -- who requested anonymity to describe private conversations with the candidate and his team -- said that he is in a much more focused head space Tuesday than he has been in recent days -- with two suggesting that favorable public polling have helped.

Two of the sources said that that the Trump strategy will not be to paint Harris as a flip-flopper, but rather to take her most liberal past position and make her own it. One person pointed to comments by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., as a road map. On Sunday, he went on NBC News' ""Meet the Press"" that Harris is a progressive but ""doing what she thinks is right in order to win the election.""

Trump, too, has frequently shifted his positions over the years, including on issues like abortion and TikTok.

Harris, for her part, will try to ""remind people of what it was like during Donald Trump's years,"" according to a source familiar with her debate strategy.

Her team had unsuccessfully pushed to have the candidates' microphones on the whole time. But even with the microphones muted while the other person is speaking, they're preparing for unscripted and potentially volatile moments -- including the possibility that Trump makes derogatory comments about her, according to sources familiar with her preparations.

The Harris campaign did not immediately return a request for comment."
43,"WASHINGTON - A ceremony on Tuesday will posthumously present Congress' highest honor -- the Congressional Gold Medal -- to 13 U.S. service members who were killed during the chaotic and deadly withdrawal from Afghanistan.

House Speaker Mike Johnson is hosting the ceremony, which is scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. ET in the Capitol Rotunda. The top Republican and Democratic leaders for both the House and Senate are expected to speak.

The Congressional Gold Medal is awarded for distinguished achievements and contributions by individuals, institutions, or groups.

The ceremony comes as the politics of a presidential election swirl around the 2021 withdrawal. Here's what to know:

The 13 U.S. troops were killed along with more than 170 Afghans in a suicide bombing at Abbey Gate near Kabul's Airport in August 2021.

Both Democrats and Republicans supported the legislation to honor the fallen service members, and President Joe Biden signed the legislation in December 2021.

Tuesday's ceremony is taking place against the backdrop of a bitter back and forth over who is to blame for the rushed and deadly evacuation from Kabul. Johnson scheduled the ceremony just hours before the first debate between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump.

Most assessments have concluded Trump and Biden share blame for the disastrous end to America's longest war, which saw enemy Taliban take over Afghanistan again before the last American troops even flew out of the Kabul airport.

The Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) - the main U.S. government watchdog for the war - pointed to Trump's 2020 deal with the Taliban to withdraw all U.S. forces and military contractors as ""the single most important factor"" in the collapse of U.S.-allied Afghan security forces and Taliban takeover, followed by Biden's April 2021 announcement that he would proceed with the withdrawal.

On Sunday, House Republicans released a scathing investigation into the withdrawal that cast blame on Biden's administration and minimized the role of Trump, who had signed the withdrawal deal with the Taliban.

Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, praised the recently-published House report that blames Biden's administration and was led by the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Republican Rep. Michael McCaul.

""We must not allow the Biden-Harris Administration to rewrite history,"" Johnson said in a statement. ""The families of the 13 fallen servicemembers and the allies we abandoned in Afghanistan deserve better.""

White House national security spokesman John Kirby on Monday criticized the House report as partisan and one-sided, and said it revealed little new information as well as several inaccuracies. He noted that evacuation plans had started well before the pullout and the U.S. did not hand over equipment to the Taliban. He said the fall of Kabul ""moved a lot faster than anyone could have anticipated.""

He also acknowledged that during the evacuation ""not everything went according to plan. Nothing ever does.""

""We hold ourselves all accountable for that,"" he said of the deaths.

Trump has put the Afghan withdrawal, with the backing of some of the families of the Americans killed, into the center of his campaign. Last month, his political team distributed video of him attending a wreath-laying ceremony for the fallen service members at Arlington National Cemetery on the third anniversary of the bombing, despite the cemetery's prohibition on partisan activity on the grounds as well as an altercation with a cemetery employee who was trying to make sure the campaign followed those rules.

The Gold Star military families who invited him to the Arlington ceremony have defended Trump's actions. At a news conference outside the Capitol on Monday, they implored for the House report to be taken seriously and demanded accountability for those in leadership during the evacuation from Kabul.

""President Trump is certainly not perfect. But he's a far better choice, in my opinion, than the mess that Biden and Harris have created since Kabul,"" said Paula Knauss Selph, whose son Ryan Knauss died in the Abbey Gate attack.

While Trump and Republicans have sought to link Harris to the withdrawal as a campaign issue, and Harris has said she was the last person in the room when Biden made his decision, neither watchdog reviews nor the 18-month investigation by House Republicans have identified any instance where the vice president had a significant impact on decision-making.

Still, House Republicans argued that Harris, as well as Biden's national security team, needed to face accountability for the consequences of the deadly withdrawal.

""Kamala Harris wants to be the president of the United States. She wants to be commander in chief. She needs to answer for this report immediately,"" said Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican on the committee.

McCaul, the chairman, also defended the timing of the report by saying that the committee's investigation had to overcome resistance from the Biden administration.

The top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, also issued a memorandum in response to the GOP report, saying he was concerned by the ""attempts to politicize the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.""

""Republicans' partisan attempts to garner headlines rather than acknowledge the full facts and substance of their investigation have only increased with the heat of an election season,"" Meeks said.

Later this month, Congressional Gold Medals will also be awarded to the NASA mathematicians known as the ""Hidden Figures"" who played a significant role in astronaut John Glenn's launch into orbit.

Recipients of the prestigious awards are Katherine Johnson in recognition of her service to the U.S. as a mathematician, Dr. Christine Darden for her service as an aeronautical engineer to the U.S., and Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson in recognition of their service to the nation during the space race.

NASA Administrator Bill Nelson will represent the agency during a Congressional Gold Medal ceremony at 3 p.m. ET on Sept. 18 at the Emancipation Hall in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.

Billie Jean King, the tennis Hall of Famer and outspoken activist for women's equal rights in sports, could also be awarded a Congressional Gold Medal - becoming the first individual female athlete to receive the prestigious award.

Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey said last week that they have enough votes in the House to grant her the distinguished award. The only step left was to get the bill to the floor for a vote. The companion bill in the Senate passed unanimously.

Lawmakers introduced the bill in September 2023 on the 50th anniversary of King's victory over Bobby Riggs in the ""Battle of the Sexes,"" still the most-watched tennis match of all-time. That same year, King led the successful push for the U.S. Open to award equal prize money to its men's and women's champions, and the WTA Tour was created.

Baseball players Jackie Robinson and Roberto Clemente, and golfers Jack Nicklaus, Byron Nelson and Arnold Palmer are among some of the athlete recipients."
44,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. small-business confidence fell in August, reversing the prior month's jump amid growing uncertainty ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election and expectations of weak sales.

The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) said on Tuesday its Small Business Optimism Index dropped 2.5 points to 91.2 last month. The index had surged in July to the highest reading since February 2022. The survey's Uncertainty Index increased 2 points to 92, the highest since October 2020.

Economists, however, cautioned against reading too much into the ebb in sentiment and rise in uncertainty.

Small business owners tend to lean Republican and some economists had viewed the jump in sentiment as largely driven by politics and a stock market rally following then-Democratic Party candidate President Joe Biden's poor debate performance against Republican Party candidate Donald Trump.

Economists had anticipated a reversal after Biden dropped out of the White House race and handed the baton to Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump and Harris are locked in a tight contest, and the stock market has been lackluster.

""It is important to not get hung up on the headline index as political bias can distort the signal,"" said Bernard Yaros, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. ""The NFIB uncertainty index typically increases during presidential election years. However, it is rising much sooner and faster than normal, consistent with other measures of policy uncertainty.""

The net share of businesses expecting higher inflation-adjusted sales volumes in the next three months fell 9 points to -18%.

""Clearly, 'uncertainty' has been on the rise,"" said NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg. ""And the stock market is expressing some unease ... and the election is just weeks away.""

Though business owners continued to worry about inflation, the share ticked down and fewer reported raising average selling prices. But labor shortages remain a challenge for small businesses, even as job openings in the nation have declined, resulting in a rise in the share of owners planning to raise compensation in the next three months.

Forty percent of all owners reported job openings they could not fill in August, up 2 points from July. Most of the unfilled positions were for skilled workers, and were concentrated in the transportation, construction and manufacturing sectors.

Job creation plans, however, continued to decline. That is in line with the slowdown in nonfarm payrolls gains.

The share of owners planning capital investment increased, with many of them buying new equipment, improving or expanding facilities. A very small minority reported that financing was their top business problem.

The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates next week, kicking off its easing cycle with a 25 basis points reduction. The U.S. central bank has kept its policy rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range for more than a year, having raised it by 525 basis points in 2022 and 2023."
45,"WASHINGTON - Tuesday's presidential debate will offer Americans their most comprehensive view yet of Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.

The candidates will face off for the first time at 9 p.m. in Philadelphia.

This high-stakes encounter provides both candidates a crucial platform to present their contrasting visions for the nation following a turbulent summer of campaigning.

Trump has faced challenges in adjusting to Harris, who is the first woman, Black person, and person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president.

Meanwhile, Harris will undergo a rare session of extended questioning, having participated in only one formal interview since assuming the Democratic nomination six weeks ago.

The ABC News Presidential Debate will also air live on ABC News.

The Associated Press was provided a copy of the rules ahead of the debate, and they report the parameters in place for the September 10 debate are nearly the same as they were for the June debate between Trump and President Joe Biden.

That means there won't be an audience or live microphones.

ABC News says the candidates will stand behind lecterns, will not make opening statements and will not be allowed to bring notes during the 90-minute debate, the Associated Press reports.

Vice Presidential candidates JD Vance and Tim Walz are set to debate on October 1 in New York City, hosted by CBS News."
46,"BOSTON (WHDH) - A new presidential debate is bringing with it a new rival for former President Donald Trump Tuesday.

But as he gets set to take the stage in Philadelphia, Trump is leaning on a familiar playbook for preparations, meeting with senior advisors and policy experts.

Vice President Kamala Harris is taking a different approach, holding mock debates and seeking advice from people who have sparred with Trump before.

On the eve of the debate, 7NEWS spoke with Emerson College pollster Spencer Kimball, who said the stakes in this debate may be especially high for Harris, since she is more of an unknown candidate than Trump.

""Voters are going to look at everything she says and how she acts and walk away with their impression of her,"" Kimball said Monday night. ""And that's going to be very costly.""

""If she has a great night, she has a chance to win over some voters,"" Kimball said. ""If she has a poor night, there's a chance that they slip away.""

Trump was on the debate stage in June when he faced President Joe Biden. The debate sparked weeks of concern and ultimately prompted Biden to end his re-election campaign.

Biden endorsed Harris as his replacement atop the Democratic ticket.

After Harris secured the Democratic nomination, named Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, and rallied her party at the Democratic National Convention, attention quickly turned to a debate with Trump.

Representatives from both campaigns reportedly sparred over rules for the debate before settling on a similar slate of rules to those used in the June debate.

Each candidate will be allowed two minutes to answer questions. Microphones will only be live for the candidate whose turn it is to speak. And candidate will not be allowed to bring prewritten notes on stage.

There will be no live audience.

With the first early ballots in the general election set to go to voters hours before the debate, Kimball said the challenge for both Harris and Trump will be to define the presidential race in ways that favor their respective bids for the White House.

""Is it about immigration? Is it about the economy? Is it about threats to democracy?"" he said. ""That's what I think both candidates are going to wrestle up against on Tuesday night -- defining what this campaign is for the voters.""

Beyond Tuesday, there are no further presidential debates currently scheduled.

The vice presidential debate between Walz and Sen. JD Vance of Ohio is set for Oct. 1.

Tuesday's ABC News Presidential Debate is scheduled to begin at 9 p.m. 7NEWS will have a simulcast of the debate.

47,"PHILADELPHIA -- Tuesday has arrived, and with it, a crucial chance for both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump to make their case to voters on stage in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Party operatives and campaign officials who spoke with the Washington Examiner outlined strategies for each candidate on how to emerge successful from Tuesday's debate.

Harris, who saw a huge polling boost after replacing President Joe Biden atop the Democratic ticket in July, has failed to expand her lead over Trump since August and is seeking momentum heading into Election Day.

Trump is looking to the debate as a chance to ""reset his campaign"" and finally ""draw the lines of distinction against Harris,"" according to Louis Perron, a PhD global political consultant and the author of ""Beat the Incumbent: Proven Strategies and Tactics to Win Elections.""

""Don't accuse her for something ridiculous like her laughter. Tie her to the incumbent administration and key unpopular decisions,"" he told the Washington Examiner. ""And he needs to do it in a calm, settled manner. In style, like in the last debate against Biden.""

Harris, on the other hand, must appear both presidential -- an admittedly cliche response but something she has been attempting to channel since at least the convention with her wardrobe choices and speech tenor -- and not be afraid to ""get in the mud"" with Trump, according to three veteran Democratic strategists with close ties to her 2024 campaign.

""You heard it from Michelle Obama herself at the convention. We're done with that 'when they go low' stuff. Trump hasn't seen anyone try to match his vitriol on stage at a debate, something that just given her age alone, Vice President Harris is much better equipped to do than President Biden,"" one Democratic strategist told the Washington Examiner, suggesting that Harris has learned lessons from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's failed 2016 campaign against Trump. ""The gloves are coming off.""

""Voters know just who Donald Trump is. His many flaws and crimes have been documented non-stop for the past eight years, and I'd like to see the vice president detail her plan for the number one issue this cycle: the economy,"" a second Democratic strategist explained. ""The Trump campaign has criticized her nonstop failing to produce a complete policy platform. Well, this is the time to do it. Take away their only real talking point to date.""

Pennsylvania voters themselves gave similar responses to the Washington Examiner in recent days.

Emily Pugliese, a 43-year-old Philadelphia resident and policy expert at an environmental nonprofit organization, suggested that Harris can make the ""bumbling fool"" Trump ""implode"" by simply being herself, and ""speaking clearly and concisely, which she's excellent at doing.""

Pugliese also claimed that Harris will ""absolutely"" get under Trump's skin by calling him a convicted felon, adding it's ""just the truth.""

Kassel Coover, a 42-year-old marketing professional from Chester County, wants to see Harris hit ""hard on the economy.""

""Even though the jobs reports say that the economy is doing well, you know, from where I am, there are a lot of people out of work, and we need to know that job creation is going to pick up,"" Coover stated in an interview on the outskirts of a Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff event on Sunday.

Caroline Bradley, a 46-year-old marketing professional and friend of Coover, added that Harris doesn't think ""she needs to be ladylike and quiet"" in countering Trump's bravado on stage.

""I think that she needs to label him as the old man that he is. Every single time he goes against her, saying some baloney because he doesn't know anything, and he lies a lot 'well, old man Trump over there, you know, just like grandpa,'"" she stated. ""He's been campaigning as being the young guy. She needs to flip it.""

Trump supporters want to see the former president ""tell the truth"" and draw contrasts between his policies in office and those of the Biden-Harris administration.

""He wants to be everybody's president. He has something to run on and Harris doesn't have anything to run on. That's the problem,"" David Gehring, a 37-year-old Trump Force 47 volunteer from the Pittsburgh suburbs, said of Trump. ""We have someone running for president right now that has been in there for four years and is not running on her success. She's running on what she's going to do to change things. Ma'am, you're in office today. Get to work. You're there now. Bring down inflation now.""

""Speak to what he has done that no one can dispute. Speak to the uncovering that has occurred on the legal maneuvering on the other side, he's smart,"" added Carolyn Dorazio, a business attorney and Trump Force 47 volunteer also from the Pittsburgh suburbs, added. ""Speak to the facts. When she says 'you're a convicted felon,' well no, part of the basis of that frivolous lawsuit, as attorneys will know that term. They were all frivolous. They just filed them and got away with it because they had judges that didn't care. They were politicizing the process.""

And it would appear that even Trump fans are concerned that the former president's past ""nasty woman"" tactics might backfire on the former president. Asked if he wants to see Trump continue his name-calling on stage, Gehring conceded that the campaign ""can do with a little bit less of that.""

""He has so much to run on. He has so much that he's done,"" he explained. ""There have been some really great results. I wish he would do a little bit less of that, perhaps.""

48,"WASHINGTON -- Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris will meet in a highly anticipated and potentially consequential debate Tuesday night in Philadelphia -- just over two months after President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance precipitated his exit from the race.

The debate, to be hosted by ABC News, is set for 9 p.m. Eastern and will be the first time Trump and Harris will meet in person, according to Harris. Viewers can livestream the debate on ABC.com or on the platforms ABC News Live, Disney+ and Hulu. The debate will also be simulcast on C-SPAN.

The event is the only scheduled televised exchange between the candidates before Election Day in November, though early voting kicks off in the battleground state of Pennsylvania Sept. 16 and in four other states later this month.

'We'll be ready'

Trump surrogates on Monday said the former president plans to challenge Harris on views she's changed over the years, including on fracking and immigration.

""We'll be ready tomorrow, President Trump will be ready. The question is will Kamala Harris be ready because she's gonna have a lot of things to defend,"" Jason Miller, Trump campaign senior adviser, said on a call organized by the Republican National Committee that also featured Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida and former Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, a Democratic Party defector who has endorsed Trump.

""You can't prepare for President Trump. There's just no way to do it,"" Miller later added.

Trump will also seek to tie Harris to all decisions made under the Biden administration. Gaetz dubbed her ""co-president"" and alleged on the call that Harris is ""in charge of the entire administration.""

Republicans are using the narrative to blame Harris for the 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in which 13 service members died.

The GOP-led House Committee on Foreign Affairs released a 353-page report Monday blaming the deadly conclusion of the two-decade U.S. war in Afghanistan squarely on the Biden-Harris administration. Harris' last name is mentioned 285 times in the report.

""Kamala Harris is unfit to be our president and commander-in-chief,"" Gabbard said on the call.

Retired U.S. military leaders issued a letter defending Harris' fitness to lead the country, and blaming Trump's ""chaotic approach"" to negotiating with the Taliban before leaving office.

""He repeatedly fails to take responsibility for his own role in putting service members in harm's way,"" the former generals wrote on behalf of the veterans' advocacy group National Security Leaders for America.

Trump attracted his own attention related to the Afghanistan withdrawal when his campaign staffers confronted an Arlington National Cemetery official on Aug. 26, the third anniversary of the 13 service members' deaths. The incident was first reported by NPR.

Trump has denied his staffers pushed the cemetery official aside in order to take photos in a restricted area, but the U.S. Army confirmed the incident.

'Go to Bat 4 Harris'

The vice president prepped for the debate in a Pittsburgh hotel over the weekend before traveling across the swing state Monday for the following night's prime-time event.

The Harris campaign began the week by releasing an ad Monday featuring several former Trump administration officials, including former Vice President Mike Pence and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, who have spoken out against a second Trump presidency.

The Democratic National Committee flew a banner Monday above Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia ahead of the division-leading Phillies' home game against the Tampa Bay Rays. The banner read: ""Don't Strikeout W/Trump Go to Bat 4 Harris.""

After roughly 50 days into her campaign and just 56 days until the election, Harris released her policy platform one day ahead of the debate. The four-pillar plan includes promises to lower taxes on the middle class and build affordable housing, protect reproductive freedoms and civil rights, secure the border and address gun violence, and ""stand up to dictators"" and support veterans.

Harris also vowed to support an ethics code for the U.S. Supreme Court, and to ""ensure that no former president has immunity for crimes committed while in the White House"" -- a reference to the high court's July ruling that granted former presidents immunity for core official acts and presumptive immunity for ""outer perimeter"" duties, but none for personal actions.

The Trump campaign accused Harris' platform of ""dishonesty"" in a campaign email sent Monday. ""We know the results of her policies: chaos, devastation and destruction.""

Trump and the Republican party released a platform in July that centered on 20 core promises which swore to ""seal the border,"" ""carry out the largest deportation operation in American history,"" and ""end inflation,"" among others.

When asked by reporters Saturday in Pittsburgh's Strip District market area if she was ready to debate Trump, the former California prosecutor and U.S. senator answered, ""Yes, I am. Yes.""

What's the main message she wants to tell Trump on the debate stage?

""There is a lot,"" Harris said in response to the question.

""But look, it's time to turn the page on the divisiveness. It's time to bring our country together to chart a new way forward,"" she said.

Trump's legal issues ahead of debate

While Harris hunkered down for debate prep, Trump has been focusing in recent days on his myriad legal issues and hosting long-winded appearances.

On Saturday the former president held court for nearly two hours at a campaign rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin, and repeated a debunked claim that Venezuelan gang members had overtaken an Aurora, Colorado, apartment building. He told the crowd that removing Venezuelan immigrants from the state will ""be a bloody story.""

He also downplayed his New York state conviction as a ""witch hunt,"" as he has several times before.

Trump, the only former president to become a convicted felon, learned Friday that a Manhattan judge delayed his sentencing until after the November election. Trump was convicted in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to a porn star ahead of the 2016 presidential election.

Trump also spoke for nearly an hour Friday at Trump Tower during what was billed as a press conference but included no questions. The appearance followed oral arguments in his appeal of a civil trial verdict in which he was found liable of sexual abuse and defamation of writer E. Jean Carroll.

On Thursday his lawyers pleaded not guilty on his behalf in federal court to a renewed indictment alleging he co-conspired to subvert the 2020 presidential results. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan set a pre-trial schedule that includes deadlines both before and after November's election.

The vice presidential debate between Ohio U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is scheduled to be hosted by CBS News in New York City on Oct. 1."
49,"PHILADELPHIA - Two well-known former Democrats turned independents who are backing Donald Trump will be in the spin room at Tuesday night's debate between the former president and Vice President Kamala Harris, to talk up Trump's performance.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. the well-known environmental activist and vaccine skeptic who last month suspended his own presidential campaign and endorsed Trump, will be on hand at Philadelphia's National Constitution Center, the Trump campaign confirmed to Fox News.

Joining Kennedy and Gabbard in the spin room at the debate - which is the first and potentially only face-to-face showdown between Harris and Trump before Election Day on Nov 5 - is a squad of high-profile Republicans.

Topping the list is Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio.

50,"philadelphia - It is the birthplace of U.S. independence, the 'City of Brotherly Love,' and the hometown of beloved fictional boxer 'Rocky' Balboa.

Now Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, will be center stage again when Kamala Harris and Donald Trump meet in a highly anticipated televised debate that could weigh heavily on the November election.

The two, who have never met in person, will square off at 9 p.m. ET (0100 GMT) for a 90-minute debate hosted by ABC News.

Police are bracing for protests, with pro-Palestinian groups angry with Harris' continued support of Israel planning to demonstrate. Barricades have been erected around the National Constitution Center, the site of the debate, barring access to the historic area that includes the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall, where the U.S. Constitution was signed.

People wave as the motorcade with the Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, arrives near her hotel in Philadelphia, Sept. 9, 2024, ahead of the presidential debate with Republican nominee Donald Trump.

Meanwhile, several of the city's bars and universities are planning watch parties. Top Democrats will gather at a hotel for a watch party that Harris is expected to attend after the debate ends. Trump's plans after the debate are not yet public.

Some Philadelphia residents said they hoped to learn more about Harris.

'I wasn't, like, super impressed with her in 2020 when she had the presidential debates and for the primary,' said Dan Bessler, a Philadelphia resident and sales worker. 'But she is a prosecutor. ... I think she'll be able to hold her own better than Biden was able to at his age.'

President Joe Biden's faltering debate performance against Trump in June essentially ended his political career, sparking powerful Democrats to convince him he should step aside ahead and allow Harris, his vice president, to run instead.

Since then, Harris has broken fundraising records and sparked new enthusiasm in the party, but opinion polls suggest a tight race looms with Trump.

With 19 electoral votes, Pennsylvania is the biggest prize of the basket of battleground states expected to decide the election. Most pundits predict whoever wins Pennsylvania will win the White House.

Democrats historically win Pennsylvania by running up huge margins in Philadelphia, to offset losses throughout much of the rest of the state.

In 2020, the city saw its highest turnout since 1984 - 68% - but it paled beside the statewide figure of 76.5%.

51,"LAS VEGAS -- Sam Brown, a first-time candidate in Nevada who could tip control of the upper chamber this November, can score an upset against first-term Democrat Sen. Jacky Rosen, GOP leaders say.

Brown, 40, a combat veteran who survived massive burn injuries during a 2008 incident in Afghanistan when a roadside bomb exploded under his vehicle's fuel tank, trails 67-year-old Rosen by 10.7 percentage points in the current RealClear Politics polling average.

Former President Donald Trump is in a virtual Silver State tie with VP Kamala Harris. The Democrat nominee has a 0.6% RCP average poll lead, well within the margin of error. But one insider from Brown's campaign said their internal polls are showing the Senate race is also within the margin of error.

Although the late Democrat Sen. Harry Reid -- who spent 30 years in the Senate including eight as majority leader -- remains an influential presence here three years after his death, there are signs Nevada could tip towards the GOP, especially if Trump carries the state this year.

Two years ago, Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, whose father preceded Reid as Nevada Senator, lost a Senate bid to Catherine Cortez Masto by 8,000 votes. That's roughly four ballots per precinct, per Montana Sen. Steve Daines, who heads up the GOP's Senate campaign arm. Bad 2022 election day weather -- snow in northern Nevada and light rain in the southern part of the state -- may have held back GOP turnout, he added.

That's not to mention the uphill battle for turnout in midterm elections with no presidential candidates topping the ticket, which was the case in 2022. Daines insisted that in 2024, however, trends favor the GOP.

""Remember, on that night ... Joe Lombardo was also elected governor,"" Daines said. So Nevada elected a Republican governor in 2022, the only Republican governor pickup in the nation"" that year.

Brown's ""voters haven't come home yet,"" Daines said of the state's Republicans, ""but they will come home."" He said that efforts from groups such as the Club for Growth, which is pledging $2 million in support of Brown's bid, will also pay off.

Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who chaired the GOP Senate campaign arm last midterm election cycle, was equally optimistic about Brown's prospects when speaking with reporters last week.

""I think Sam's going to win,"" said Scott, who's angling for majority leader if Republicans regain control of the Senate. ""He's clearly a war hero, he went to serve this country. He's got the right views. He knows that we can't have have government that has no accountability. We've got to support Israel. We've got to destroy Hamas.""

Rosen has counterpunched Brown's campaign with ads claiming the Republican would support a nationwide abortion ban, which he denies. She claimed in a statement Brown ""will say anything to get elected as he tries to cover up his decade-long opposition to abortion rights.""

But the Brown campaign insider said Rosen's abortion refrain is an attempted deflection from issues affecting Nevadans' pocketbooks.

""They only want to talk about abortion because Jackie's record on housing affordability, on voting, for spending packages that just have increased inflation, increased our national debt, which hits everyone in the pocketbook,"" the insider said of the Rosen campaign."
52,"Washington -- Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are set to meet in Philadelphia on Tuesday for their first -- and perhaps only -- debate before the November presidential election.

The match-up will mark the first time Trump and Harris have met in person, and it comes at a crucial point in the election season. A new CBS News poll shows the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees locked in tight races in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin with less than 60 days until voters choose who will be the next president.

Hosted by ABC News, the debate was initially supposed to be the second meeting of Trump and President Biden, but Mr. Biden's decision in late July to bow out of the race set off a frenetic series of events that culminated with Harris accepting the Democratic presidential nomination at the party's convention last month.

The weeks leading up to the debate have seen the two sides sparring over the rules. Harris' campaign pushed for microphones to be on throughout the debate, while Trump said his campaign agreed to the same rules that were in place for the first face-off. When he and Mr. Biden met, microphones were active only when a candidate was speaking.

Muted microphones ultimately prevailed after Harris' campaign accepted the rules set forth by ABC, though it warned she will be ""fundamentally disadvantaged"" by the format.

The debate is set to run 90 minutes and will be hosted by ABC's David Muir and Linsey Davis. Both candidates will stand behind podiums, and they cannot bring props or prewritten notes on stage, according to rules released by ABC. There will not be a public audience in the room. ABC is allowing other TV networks to simulcast the debate.

Harris has spent the days leading up to the meeting in Pittsburgh, where she participated in extended mock debates. Trump, meanwhile, has been going over policy positions with advisers in the run-up to the event, though his preparations have been characterized as informal.

The ABC-hosted debate is the only one that both Harris and Trump have agreed to so far. The former president had proposed a total of three match-ups, with the other two hosted by Fox News and NBC News. But the vice president has only agreed to Tuesday's debate, while her campaign has indicated she would be open to one more in October. Trump has also suggested several times he may pull out of the ABC debate while criticizing its top hosts, though he appears poised to participate.

53,"ALLENTOWN, Pa. -- Kamala Harris' husband headlined a slate of Democrats rallying in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley over the weekend, all of whom came out swinging against former President Donald Trump.

Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff delivered Saturday's last and longest speech in support of his wife's presidential campaign -- asserting the veep is ""who she's always been,"" despite being called out for flip-flopping on the issues.

""You know what we're seeing right now? The most badass version of Kamala Harris when we needed it!"" Emhoff told the crowd.

""This ain't a honeymoon... This is what a real leader looks like.""

Emhoff debuted some policy proposals for a potential Harris administration while taking aim at Trump for his ""hate"" that is ""poisoning the blood"" of America -- a reference to the ex-prez's previous comments on illegal immigration.

Emhoff said Harris has proposed increasing the tax deduction for small businesses' startup expenses from $5,000 to $50,000. She also plans to oversee the construction of 3 million new housing units to lower living costs and include a $25,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers, per the second gentleman.

Other speakers at Saturday's rally included Department of Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, hometown Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.) and Allentown Mayor Matt Tuerk, who introduced the Emhoff to the stage.

Cardona -- who spoke partially in Spanish to the many Latinos in attendance -- enthusiastically worked the crowd by rapping Black Sheep's ""The Choice Is Yours"" to contrast the records of Harris and Trump.

""You got one [candidate] that wants to fix the education system in Puerto Rico and fix the energy system, the grid in Puerto Rico,"" Cardona said of Harris, ""and then the other one throws paper towels into a crowd after a hurricane,"" he said of Trump. ""We haven't forgotten it.""

Rally attendees told The Post they are concerned about a variety of issues, but excited to vote in-person on Election Day.

Michele Bright, a 49-year-old commercial lender from nearby Easton, came out to support the Harris' campaign, citing women's rights as a key issue for her, but told The Post: ""We've gotta do something about the economy, the housing market and immigration,"" Bright said.

An Allentown man, 25-year-old Frederick Stevens, wanted to hear Emhoff and Cardona speak about education issues -- particularly as Allentown schools continue to struggle.

""Our schools are nationally underperforming. We need federal money, and we need to get the test scores so we can get the federal money,"" he told The Post."
54,"Washington DC [US], September 10 (ANI): Ahead of the US presidential elections this November, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are set to face off in their first debate in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday.

The debate will mark the first time that the Democratic and Republican candidate will meet in person and share a stage. The two will spar for 90 minutes in a setting, which will have no studio audience nor will the two be allowed to have pre-written notes or props. The two candidates will also not be permitted to question each other directly.

ABC News outlet, which is moderating the debate, said the showdown is taking place months after the last debate ended President Joe Biden's re-election bid and catapulted Harris as the Democratic candidate.

As the countdown to Election Day reaches its final stretch, the stakes have never been higher. Tonight's highly anticipated debate will see the candidates grilled on the issues that matter most to voters, including the economy, immigration, and reproductive rights, as each tries to persuade millions of voters and viewers that they're the ones best suited to be president.

""I think there's an outsized expectation of 'gosh, the last guy dropped out, let's watch it.' So, I think that there's a lot more at stake than normally I would ever say is at stake,"" said Sean Spicer, Trump's first White House press secretary, as cited by ABC.

Tonight's highly anticipated debate promises to be a pivotal moment for Kamala Harris, as she faces intense scrutiny over the Biden administration's handling of contentious issues like border security and inflation. Moderators will likely push her to reconcile her current positions with the more liberal stances she took during her 2020 presidential campaign, including her recent shifts on fracking, border policy, and healthcare.

Donald Trump, renowned for his capacity to dominate the political conversation and exploit his opponents' vulnerabilities, will likely seek to capitalize on his strengths on immigration and trade.

As Trump engages with Harris, he must tread carefully to avoid alienating female voters, among whom his support is already tenuous. If he comes across as condescending or dismissive, it could further erode his standing with this critical demographic. Harris, as the first woman of color to run for vice president on a major party ticket, presents a historic opportunity for the Democratic Party to connect with diverse voters and challenge Trump's divisive rhetoric.

Democrats who spoke to ABC News said that Harris has two main goals ""affirm to voters that she is ready to lead the country and the free world and to describe in more detail what policies she'd pursue as president.""

Similarly, Republicans who spoke to ABC News said Trump should focus on policy contrasts, boasting that he has the edge on issues like inflation and immigration and can try to pin her down on her policy reversals on things like fracking - while he himself searches for consistent stances on issues like abortion.

ABC News said that Trump blamed the Biden-Harris administration's handling of the economy, saying their policies are to blame for inflation, which reached a 40-year high in 2022 but has since cooled to 2.9 per cent year-over-year as of July.

Trump has pledged to cut costs by restoring ""energy independence"" through drilling more oil and lowering gas prices. He's also said he would reduce the national debt, eliminate regulations and implement a variety of tax cuts for domestic corporations as well as tariffs on foreign imports.

Harris has presented an ""opportunity economy"" plan, which includes USD 25,000 in down-payment support for first-time homeowners, construction of 3 million new housing units, raising the minimum wage and a federal ban on corporate price-gouging on food and groceries.

She has also pitched a USD 50,000 tax benefit for new small businesses and a lower long-term capital gains tax of 28 per cent.

""World News Tonight"" anchor and managing editor David Muir and ABC News Live ""Prime"" anchor Linsey Davis will serve as moderators.

It's a big test for the Disney-owned network in the only scheduled debate between Harris and Trump in the 2024 race that could serve as a make-or-break moment for either campaign.

So while this debate could help set the political environment for the last two months of the 2024 presidential race, it also will be the last chance for the two candidates to reach some voters in states where every ballot matters. (ANI)"
55,"SHOWDOWN IN PHILADELPHIA: In what is their first, and may well be their only face-to-face showdown, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will square off at 9 p.m. in a tightly constrained 90-minute debate before an audience-free auditorium in Philadelphia's National Constitution Center. The candidates will answer questions in two-minute increments, and according to the rules, they are not supposed to question each other.

The debate comes as the latest New York Times and Siena College poll shows Trump has retaken a narrow but statistically insignificant lead over Harris, 48% to 47%, well with the three-percentage-point margin of error.

However, the poll shows that Trump enjoys a clear edge in who voters believe would handle the issues they consider most important -- the economy, inflation, and immigration. When asked, ""Which candidate do you think would do a better job of handling the issue you think is most important?"" 50% said Trump, 45% said Harris.

When asked to rank the issues, 22% said the economy, including jobs and the stock market, was the most important factor guiding their vote, with 12% picking immigration. Both were topics where Trump polled stronger. Harris has an edge on abortion, which 15% of voters said would decide who they voted for.

Foreign policy ranked ninth, with only 3% of voters surveyed saying it would factor into their decision, 2% citing the war in the Middle East, and fewer than one-half of 1% naming Ukraine's war with Russia.

HARRIS AND TRUMP TO GET CORNERED ON POLICY AT PHILADELPHIA DEBATE

BLAMING HARRIS FOR AFGHANISTAN: Republican efforts to hang the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan three years ago on Harris seems to be resonating with voters. On Monday, the House Foreign Affairs Committee released a highly critical report which concluded, among other things, ""The Biden-Harris administration's failure to plan for all contingencies, the U.S. government conducted an emergency evacuation without the necessary personnel, supplies, and equipment. The administration's dereliction of duty placed U.S. servicemembers and U.S. State Department personnel in mortal danger, where the Taliban - our sworn enemy - became the first line of defense.""

""Harris has admitted in the past, and has gone on record to say she was the last to actually come into the room with regards to this Afghan botched withdrawal,"" Rep. Cory Mills (R-FL) said on Fox Business News yesterday. ""It was also made very clear by Gen. [Frank] McKenzie and former Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff, Gen. [Mark] Milley, that President Trump had actually, at the behest of his generals, had recommended for a smaller contingent force to remain behind when he realized that in the event of withdrawing civilians, that we would actually need to maintain a temporary military presence.""

The New York Times Siena College poll shows 49% of voters believe Harris deserves some or ""a lot"" of blame for the disastrous withdrawal. The poll also indicates another Harris weakness: 63% of respondents say she shares blame for problems at the border.

WHITE HOUSE PUSHBACK: Retired Rear Adm. John Kirby, who was the Pentagon's chief spokesman during the August 2021 withdrawal, delivered the administration's rebuttal to what it characterized as a highly partisan, one-sided account of the events leading up to the chaotic fall of Kabul.

""Clearly, there were moments of great violence, and there were moments of mission execution that didn't go exactly the way we wanted it to go,' Kirby said at yesterday's White House briefing. ""Nobody has walked away from that. But in the main, we were able to get 120,000-some-odd folks out of there safely with an airplane taking off about once every hour.""

But he argued the die was cast when the Trump administration signed what amounted to articles of surrender with the Taliban in Qatar in February of 2020.

""The Trump administration cut a deal called the Doha Agreement that mandated a complete U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and, yes, that included Bagram Air Base by the end of May 2021. That deal also released 5,000 Taliban fighters from prison -- 5,000 fighters,"" Kirby said. ""As General Frank McKenzie, former commander of U.S. Central Command, said himself in testimony, the Doha -- Doha deal had a, quote, 'really pernicious effect,' unquote, on the Afghan government and military. As we saw, it demoralized them and disenfranchised them. They knew right then and there that America was on its way out.""

""Indeed, in October of 2020, then-President Trump ordered his military to rush the exit from Afghanistan and have everybody leave by Christmas of that year,"" Kirby said. ""President Biden, for his part, faced a stark choice when he came to office: abide by the flawed agreement and end America's longest war or blow up the deal, extend the war, and see a much smaller contingent of American troops back in combat with the Taliban. He chose the former, and he was able to buy additional time to prepare for that withdrawal all the way into the summer.""

U.S., CHINA COMMANDERS TALKING: President Joe Biden's meeting last November with Chinese President Xi Jinping has produced one tangible result: a slight crack in the icy relations between the two countries' militaries.

Yesterday, U.S. Indo-Pacific Commander Adm. Samuel Paparo talked face-to-face via video teleconference with Gen. Wu Yanan, the commander of the People's Liberation Army's Southern Theater Command.

""During the call, Paparo underscored the importance of sustained lines of communication between the U.S. military and the PLA, noting that such discussions between senior leaders serve to clarify intent and reduce the risk of misperception or miscalculation,"" the Indo-Pacific Command said in a press release. ""Citing several recent PLA unsafe interactions with U.S. allies, Paparo reinforced the PLA's obligation to comply with international laws and norms to ensure operational safety. Paparo also urged the PLA to reconsider its use of dangerous, coercive, and potentially escalatory tactics in the South China Sea and beyond.""

""Gen. Wu and Paparo had a constructive and respectful exchange of views between experienced professionals,"" the release said. ""Paparo expressed hope that this discussion with his PLA counterpart would be the first of many such conversations.""

CHINA HAWKS IN CONGRESS KEEP PRESSURE ON WHILE SPENDING FIGHT DOMINATES DISCUSSIONS

THE FUTURE OF US TROOPS IN IRAQ: The U.S.-Iraq Higher Military Commission is charged with determining the future military relationship between the United States and Iraq. Currently, some 2,500 U.S. troops are assisting in the battle against ISIS.

U.S. troops remain in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government, which has indicated it might be time for most of those troops to leave. ""The US-Iraq Higher Military Commission executive working group continues to have their discussions,"" spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Monday. ""I'm not going to get ahead of the HMC.""

""As was clearly stated in the joint statement put out by the President and President Sudani, the two leaders reaffirmed that they would review the factors to determine when and how the mission of the global coalition in Iraq would end and transition in an orderly manner to our enduring bilateral security partnership in accordance with Iraq's constitution and the US-Iraq strategic commitment,"" Ryder said.

""We value the work that's being done via the Higher Military Commission process. Those conversations inform senior leader decisions, ultimately which rest at the seat of government, right? So, the president and the Iraqi leadership,"" Ryder said. ""I don't have any announcements to make in terms of any force posture adjustments at this time.""

56,"WASHINGTON -- House Speaker Mike Johnson is hosting a ceremony Tuesday to posthumously present Congress' highest honor -- the Congressional Gold Medal -- to 13 U.S. service members who were killed during the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, even as the politics of a presidential election swirl around the event.

Both Democrats and Republicans supported the legislation to honor the 13 U.S. troops, who were killed along with more than 170 Afghans in a suicide bombing at Abbey Gate near Kabul's Airport in August 2021. President Joe Biden signed the legislation in December 2021. The top Republican and Democratic leaders for both the House and Senate are expected to speak at Tuesday's ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda.

The event is taking place against the backdrop of a bitter back and forth over who is to blame for the rushed and deadly evacuation from Kabul. Johnson scheduled the ceremony just hours before the first debate between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump.

House Republicans also released a scathing investigation on Sunday into the withdrawal that cast blame on Biden's administration and minimized the role of Trump, who had signed the withdrawal deal with the Taliban.

Johnson, a Louisiana Republican and Trump ally, praised the House report, which was led by the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Republican Rep. Michael McCaul.

""We must not allow the Biden-Harris Administration to rewrite history,"" Johnson said in a statement. ""The families of the 13 fallen servicemembers and the allies we abandoned in Afghanistan deserve better.""

White House national security spokesman John Kirby on Monday criticized the House report as partisan and one-sided, and said it revealed little new information as well as several inaccuracies. He noted that evacuation plans had started well before the pullout and the U.S. did not hand over equipment to the Taliban. He said the fall of Kabul ""moved a lot faster than anyone could have anticipated.""

He also acknowledged that during the evacuation ""not everything went according to plan. Nothing ever does.""

""We hold ourselves all accountable for that,"" he said of the deaths.

Kirby added there would be ""quite a few"" people from the Department of Defense at the ceremony Tuesday.

The top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, also issued a memorandum in response to the GOP report, saying he was concerned by the ""attempts to politicize the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.""

""Republicans' partisan attempts to garner headlines rather than acknowledge the full facts and substance of their investigation have only increased with the heat of an election season,"" Meeks said.

Pentagon reviews have concluded that the suicide bombing was not preventable, and that suggestions troops may have seen the would-be bomber were not true.

Regardless, Trump has thrust the withdrawal, with the backing from some of the families of the Americans killed, into the center of his campaign. Last month, his political team distributed video of him attending a wreath-laying ceremony for the fallen service members at Arlington National Cemetery on the third anniversary of the bombing, despite the cemetery's prohibition on partisan activity on the grounds as well as an altercation with a cemetery employee who was trying to make sure the campaign followed those rules.

The Gold Star military families who invited him to the Arlington ceremony have defended Trump's actions. At a fiery news conference outside the Capitol Monday, they implored for the House report to be taken seriously and demanded accountability for those in leadership during evacuation from Kabul.

""President Trump is certainly not perfect. But he's a far better choice, in my opinion, than the mess that Biden and Harris have created since Kabul,"" said Paula Knauss Selph, whose son Ryan Knauss died in the Abbey Gate attack.

While Trump and Republicans have sought to link Harris to the withdrawal as a campaign issue, and Harris has said she was the last person in the room when Biden made his decision, neither watchdog reviews nor the 18-month investigation by House Republicans have identified any instance where the vice president had a significant impact on decision-making.

Still, House Republicans argued that Harris, as well as Biden's national security team, needed to face accountability for the consequences of the deadly withdrawal.

""Kamala Harris wants to be the president of the United States. She wants to be commander in chief. She needs to answer for this report immediately,"" said Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican on the committee.

McCaul, the chairman, also defended the timing of the report by saying that the committee's investigation had to overcome resistance from the Biden administration.

He cast the investigation as a ""truth-seeking mission"" rather than a partisan endeavor, but also bragged that out of all the investigations that House Republicans have launched into the Biden administration in the last two years ""this investigation is the one they fear the most.""

Most assessments have concluded Trump and Biden share blame for the disastrous end to America's longest war, which saw enemy Taliban take over Afghanistan again before the last American troops even flew out of the Kabul airport. The main U.S. government watchdog for the war points to Trump's 2020 deal with the Taliban to withdraw all U.S. forces and military contractors as ""the single most important factor"" in the collapse of U.S.-allied Afghan security forces and Taliban takeover.

Biden's April 2021 announcement that he would proceed with the withdrawal set in motion by Trump was the second-biggest factor, the watchdog said.

Both Trump and Biden kept up the staged withdrawal of U.S. forces, and in Trump's case sharply cut back important U.S. airstrikes in the Taliban, even though the Taliban failed to enter into substantive negotiations with the U.S.-backed civilian government as required by Trump's withdrawal deal."
57,"WASHINGTON -- Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will meet in person for the first time Tuesday night for perhaps their only debate, a chance of high pressure Unpleasant show their very different views for the country after a tumultuous campaign summer.

The event, at 9 p.m. Eastern in Philadelphia, will offer Americans their most detailed look at a campaign that has changed dramatically since the last debate in June. President Joe Biden has quickly curved of the race after his disastrous performanceTrump survived an attempted murder and bothedges their running companions chose.

Harris wants to show that she can make the Democratic case against Trump better than Biden. Trump, for his part, is trying to paint the vice president as an out-of-touch liberal as he tries to win over voters skeptical of his return to the White House.

Trump, 78, has had trouble adjusting to Harris59, who is the first woman, Black person and person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president. The former Republican president has at times resorted to invoking racial and gender stereotypes, frustrating allies who want Trump to focus instead on policy differences with Harris.

The vice president, in turn, will attempt to take some credit for the Biden administration's accomplishments, while also addressing its downfalls and explaining why it has moved away from its more liberal positions in the past.

The debate will expose Harris, who has had just one formal interview in the past six weeks, to a rare moment of sustained questioning.

""If she does well, it'll be a nice surprise for Democrats and they'll cheer,"" said Ari Fleischer, a Republican communications strategist and former press secretary to President George W. Bush. ""If she flops, like Joe Biden did, it could really blow this race wide open. So the stakes are even higher.""

Tim Hogan, who led Sen. Amy Klobuchar's debate preparations during the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, said Harris, a former California attorney general, would bring ""the instincts of a prosecutor to the debate stage.""

""That's a really strong asset in that environment, having someone who knows how to throw a punch and how to translate it,"" Hogan said.

The first early ballots in the presidential race will go out a few hours after the debate, hosted by ABC News. Mail-in ballots will begin to be sent out in Alabama on Wednesday.

Trump and his campaign have been highlighting the far-left positions she took during her failed 2020 presidential bid. He has been joined in his informal debate prep sessions by Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate who tore Harris to pieces during their primary election debates.

Harris has attempted to defend her shifts from liberal goals to more moderate positions on fracking, expanding Medicare for All and mandatory gun buybacks -- and even her retreat from her position that plastic straws should be banned -- as pragmatism, to insist that her ""values remain the same."" Her campaign published a page on its website Monday listing its positions on key issues.

The former president has argued that a Harris presidency would threaten the country's security, stressing that Biden tapped her to address the influx of migrants, while the Republican has renewed dark warnings about immigration and those in the country illegally, which have been central to his campaign. He has sought to portray a Harris presidency as a continuation of Biden's still-unpopular administration, particularly his economic record, as voters continue to feel the sting of inflation even as it has cooled in recent months.

Trump's team emphasizes that his tone will not change with a female opponent.

""President Trump is going to be himself,"" senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters during a call Monday.

Gabbard, who was also present at the call, added that Trump ""respects women and doesn't feel the need to be condescending or talk to women any differently than he would a man.""

His advisers suggest that Harris tends to express herself in a ""word salad"" of meaningless phrases, prompting Trump to say last week that his debate strategy was to ""let her talk.""

The former president frequently engages in rambling remarks that veer away from his policy points. He frequently makes false claims about the last election, attacks a long list of enemies and opponents working against him, praises foreign strongmen and comments on race, such as his false claim in July that Harris recently ""happened to be black.""

The vice president, who has been the Biden administration's most outspoken pro-abortion advocate after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, is expected to focus on Trump's inconsistencies on women's reproductive care, including announcing that he will vote on a statewide referendum this fall to protect Florida's six-week abortion ban.

Harris also wanted to portray himself as someone who could play a more stable role in leading the country and protecting alliances, with war still raging in Ukraine more than two years after the Russian invasion, and Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza continuing with no end in sight.

She will likely warn that Trump poses a threat to democracy, with his efforts in 2020 to overturn his presidential election loss and his angry supporters inciting an attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, over comments he made just last week. Trump has again issued a retaliatory message on social media, threatening that if he wins, he will ""lock up those engaged in unconscionable conduct,"" including lawyers, political operatives, donors, voters and election officials.

Harris has spent the better part of the last five days preparing for the debate in Pennsylvania, where she participated in hours of mock sessions with a Trump stand-in. Before the debate, she told radio host Rickey Smiley that she was brainstorming how to respond if Trump lies.

58,"WASHINGTON -- An open congressional seat is a rarity in politics and usually results in bitter, highly competitive races because it's the best way to win a seat in Congress.

But the Minnesota 3 Congressional District race between state Sen. Kelly Morrison, a Democrat, and Tad Jude, a former judge and Republican state legislator, is bucking that trend.

Two-thirds of members of Congress enter the U.S. House through an open seat, like the one vacated by Rep. Dean Phillips, the Democrat who currently represents the 3. Phillips decided against re-election after his failed bid to challenge President Biden.

Yet the race for the 3 has been decidedly low-keyed. There have been no attack ads - or ads of any kind - on television, at least not yet, no mudslinging and no involvement by the national parties or outside groups in this contest. That's especially unique in a year of mean-spirited, bare knuckled hyper partisanship.

The 3 District race is characterized by civility, house parties, boots-on-the-ground campaigning and a lot of door-knocking. Morrison said there's ""less mudslinging and more talk about policy solutions"" in the race. Jude,72, said the toughest competition is the ""sign war,"" with the rival campaigns vying to put up the most yard signs and keeping them up.

An open seat usually provokes much fiercer fighting, said Hamline University political science professor David Schultz.

""Open congressional seats are really scarce,"" he said. He called the comparatively quiet nature of the races ""an anomaly.""

That may be because the voting pattern has shifted so much in the 3 Congressional District, which was once represented for decades by a Republican and is now considered ""solid Democrat"" by the Cook Political Report and other analysts.

Both candidates have experienced running for public office and both say they adhere to the moderate wing of their respective parties.

""There is a long tradition of having moderate, bipartisan legislators in this seat,"" said Morrison, who touts her bipartisan work in the state legislature.

Meanwhile, Jude, who lives in Maple Grove, said he would join the centrist and bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus if elected to Congress.

Phillips is a member of that caucus of moderate Democrats and Republicans. When he was elected in 2018, Phillips defeated six-term Republican incumbent Erik Paulsen, who sometimes broke with his party and kept his distance from Donald Trump.

But by the time Paulsen lost his seat, the 3 Congressional District, which encompasses the suburbs north, east and south of Minneapolis, had for some time been drifting towards the Democratic Party.

In 2012, the district went narrowly for Barack Obama. In 2016 it went by a much larger margin for Hillary Clinton and in 2020 by an even larger margin for Joe Biden.

""What a lot of Republicans are concluding now is that this is a Democratic district and basically they are conceding,"" Schultz said.

While both tout their moderation, there are sharp differences between the candidates.

Morrison, 55, who lives in Deephaven with her husband and two children, is a gynecologist-obstetrician who hopes her pro-choice message resonates in the suburban 3 District. She said she decided to trade medicine for politics when Trump was elected in 2016 and she was concerned about the ""divisiveness"" of his politics.

After Trump nominated Amy Coney Barrett, a critic of Roe v. Wade, to the U.S. Supreme Court, Morrison reacted again, co-founding the Reproductive Rights Caucus in the state legislature. She said she was ready to do battle when the Supreme Court overturned Roe two years ago with its Dobbs v. Jackson decision.

Morrison said her ""particular skill set"" as an OB-GYN who supports reproductive rights ""kind of fits the ethics of the 3 District,"" which is home to many higher income households and where slightly more than half of its adult residents have bachelor's or advanced degrees.

She said she admires Phillips and his optimistic ethics of ""radical hospitality."" She's known Phillips for decades, having been in his class at The Blake School, a private preparatory high school in Minneapolis. While Morrison said although Phillips is pro choice, the struggle for abortion rights ""isn't his focus.""

Jude, meanwhile, supports former president Trump and the Supreme Court's Dodd decision, which allowed individual states to set their own abortion policy. Since the decision was handed down, 14 states have enacted near-total abortion bans, while four states - Georgia, South Carolina, Florida and Iowa -have banned abortion past roughly six weeks of pregnancy.

Another big difference is in their campaign fundraising. Morrison has raised nearly $1.4 million and Jude about $163,000.

A lawyer with a long career in public service, Jude was the youngest candidate, when at 20 years old he won a seat in the Minnesota House in 1972. He has also served as a state senator, a Hennepin County commissioner and a district court judge.

""I enjoy public service, but I really enjoy solving problems,"" he said.

One example he gave was his successful effort to derail proposed landfills in Hennepin County as a county commissioner, ""which saved our air and water quality.""

Jude said he would take his problem-solving skills to Congress and focus on reining in government spending and undocumented migration as well as legislation that would limit the authority of the White House and federal agencies.

""You should have policies created by elected representatives, not bureaucrats,"" he said.

As far as the ""Walz factor,"" Jude shrugged off the impact of having the governor at the top of the ballot.

""The highly educated voters of the 3 District are more likely than others to split their ticket,"" he said.

Schultz, however, said the presence of Walz, as well as Vice President Kamala Harris and Sen. Amy Klobuchar on the ballot will help Democrats like Morrison because it will get the Democratic vote out and win over independents.

""This is the best ticket for Democrats right now,"" he said."
59,"Washington DC [US], September 10 (ANI): Ahead of the US presidential elections this November, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are set to face off in their first debate in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday.

The debate will mark the first time that the Democratic and Republican candidate will meet in person and share a stage. The two will spar for 90 minutes in a setting, which will have no studio audience nor will the two be allowed to have pre-written notes or props. The two candidates will also not be permitted to question each other directly.

ABC News outlet, which is moderating the debate, said the showdown is taking place months after the last debate ended President Joe Biden's re-election bid and catapulted Harris as the Democratic candidate.

As the countdown to Election Day reaches its final stretch, the stakes have never been higher. Tonight's highly anticipated debate will see the candidates grilled on the issues that matter most to voters, including the economy, immigration, and reproductive rights, as each tries to persuade millions of voters and viewers that they're the ones best suited to be president.

""I think there's an outsized expectation of 'gosh, the last guy dropped out, let's watch it.' So, I think that there's a lot more at stake than normally I would ever say is at stake,"" said Sean Spicer, Trump's first White House press secretary, as cited by ABC.

Tonight's highly anticipated debate promises to be a pivotal moment for Kamala Harris, as she faces intense scrutiny over the Biden administration's handling of contentious issues like border security and inflation. Moderators will likely push her to reconcile her current positions with the more liberal stances she took during her 2020 presidential campaign, including her recent shifts on fracking, border policy, and healthcare.

Donald Trump, renowned for his capacity to dominate the political conversation and exploit his opponents' vulnerabilities, will likely seek to capitalize on his strengths on immigration and trade.

As Trump engages with Harris, he must tread carefully to avoid alienating female voters, among whom his support is already tenuous. If he comes across as condescending or dismissive, it could further erode his standing with this critical demographic. Harris, as the first woman of color to run for vice president on a major party ticket, presents a historic opportunity for the Democratic Party to connect with diverse voters and challenge Trump's divisive rhetoric.

Democrats who spoke to ABC News said that Harris has two main goals ""affirm to voters that she is ready to lead the country and the free world and to describe in more detail what policies she'd pursue as president.""

Similarly, Republicans who spoke to ABC News said Trump should focus on policy contrasts, boasting that he has the edge on issues like inflation and immigration and can try to pin her down on her policy reversals on things like fracking - while he himself searches for consistent stances on issues like abortion.

ABC News said that Trump blamed the Biden-Harris administration's handling of the economy, saying their policies are to blame for inflation, which reached a 40-year high in 2022 but has since cooled to 2.9 per cent year-over-year as of July.

Trump has pledged to cut costs by restoring ""energy independence"" through drilling more oil and lowering gas prices. He's also said he would reduce the national debt, eliminate regulations and implement a variety of tax cuts for domestic corporations as well as tariffs on foreign imports.

Harris has presented an ""opportunity economy"" plan, which includes USD 25,000 in down-payment support for first-time homeowners, construction of 3 million new housing units, raising the minimum wage and a federal ban on corporate price-gouging on food and groceries.

She has also pitched a USD 50,000 tax benefit for new small businesses and a lower long-term capital gains tax of 28 per cent.

""World News Tonight"" anchor and managing editor David Muir and ABC News Live ""Prime"" anchor Linsey Davis will serve as moderators.

It's a big test for the Disney-owned network in the only scheduled debate between Harris and Trump in the 2024 race that could serve as a make-or-break moment for either campaign.

So while this debate could help set the political environment for the last two months of the 2024 presidential race, it also will be the last chance for the two candidates to reach some voters in states where every ballot matters. (ANI)"
60,"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Top US Republicans peddled false claims denigrating immigrants Monday, saying Haitian arrivals are stealing and eating pets -- a conspiracy theory, debunked by authorities, that went viral as Donald Trump stokes fears ahead of November's election.

Trump running mate J.D. Vance and Republican lawmakers, officials and influencers have pushed unfounded rumors out of Springfield, Ohio that have thrust the city's growing Haitian population into the center of the US presidential race.

""Protect our ducks and kittens in Ohio!"" Republicans on the US House Judiciary Committee posted on their X account, with an obviously fake image of Trump rescuing a white duck and a striped cat.

""Please vote for Trump so Haitian immigrants don't eat us,"" Senator Ted Cruz posted over an image of kittens.

Republicans appeared to be using the stories, which have clear racial undertones, to fuel a political attack against Trump's rival Kamala Harris to suggest she has failed to rein in illegal immigration during her three-plus years as US vice president.

Immigration is seen as a critical issue in a nail-biter of an election, and the two candidates square off Tuesday night in their first and potentially only presidential debate.

Some right-wing social media accounts had amplified a news report about a woman in Ohio allegedly eating and killing a pet cat. And while no evidence emerged linking the woman to migrants or the Haitian community, footage of her arrest was widely shared by influencers.

City law enforcement quickly debunked the conspiracy theories. ""There have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community,"" Springfield police said in a statement, adding there have been no verified instances of immigrants engaged in illegal activities like squatting in front of residents' homes.

But the disinformation posts have snowballed, having been viewed millions of times. X owner Elon Musk, who recently endorsed Trump and has 197 million followers on the platform formerly known as Twitter, has reposted some of the images.

Vance, who is from Ohio, took to X to claim that ""Haitian illegal immigrants (are) draining social services and generally causing chaos all over Springfield, Ohio.

""Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn't be in this country.""

Trump himself weighed in Monday, posting on Truth Social: ""20,000 Haitian migrants were dumped into the small town of Springfield, Ohio,"" referring to the large influx of migrants from the impoverished Caribbean nation in recent years.

Social services, schools and housing have been stressed in the city for years, with some pointing to migration as a factor. The issues have been brought up at city functions, including an August 27 Springfield City Commission.

Leading Democrats largely have not addressed the pet theft claims."
61,"Washington -- Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are set to meet in Philadelphia on Tuesday for their first -- and perhaps only -- debate before the November presidential election.

The match-up will mark the first time Trump and Harris have met in person, and it comes at a crucial point in the election season. A new CBS News poll shows the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees locked in tight races in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin with less than 60 days until voters choose who will be the next president.

Hosted by ABC News, the debate was initially supposed to be the second meeting of Trump and President Biden, but Mr. Biden's decision in late July to bow out of the race set off a frenetic series of events that culminated with Harris accepting the Democratic presidential nomination at the party's convention last month.

The weeks leading up to the debate have seen the two sides sparring over the rules. Harris' campaign pushed for microphones to be on throughout the debate, while Trump said his campaign agreed to the same rules that were in place for the first face-off. When he and Mr. Biden met, microphones were active only when a candidate was speaking.

Muted microphones ultimately prevailed after Harris' campaign accepted the rules set forth by ABC, though it warned she will be ""fundamentally disadvantaged"" by the format.

The debate is set to run 90 minutes and will be hosted by ABC's David Muir and Linsey Davis. Both candidates will stand behind podiums, and they cannot bring props or prewritten notes on stage, according to rules released by ABC. There will not be a public audience in the room. ABC is allowing other TV networks to simulcast the debate.

Harris has spent the days leading up to the meeting in Pittsburgh, where she participated in extended mock debates. Trump, meanwhile, has been going over policy positions with advisers in the run-up to the event, though his preparations have been characterized as informal.

The ABC-hosted debate is the only one that both Harris and Trump have agreed to so far. The former president had proposed a total of three match-ups, with the other two hosted by Fox News and NBC News. But the vice president has only agreed to Tuesday's debate, while her campaign has indicated she would be open to one more in October. Trump has also suggested several times he may pull out of the ABC debate while criticizing its top hosts, though he appears poised to participate."
62,"(PHILADELPHIA) -- Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump square off Tuesday at what could be their only presidential debate, setting high stakes for an event expected to be viewed by millions of Americans and a key sliver of undecided voters.

Harris' momentum -- after her unusual rise as the Democrats' nominee shot her into a neck-and-neck race -- has now stalled, making the head-to-head matchup an opportunity to get that started again if she can adequately make the argument for her own candidacy and cast Trump as unfit for another term.

Trump, meanwhile, has struggled to find a way to consistently and effectively attack his new opponent but has remained highly competitive, thanks to a large base of immovable supporters and the broad swath of Americans who already have fixed views of him. Tuesday's debate offers him an opportunity to solidify his support while painting Harris in a negative light to an electorate that has less cemented perceptions of her.

The ABC News debate, moderated by David Muir and Linsey Davis, will take place on Tuesday, Sept. 10 at 9 p.m ET. A prime-time pre-debate special will air at 8 p.m. ET. It will air on ABC and stream on ABC News Live, Disney+ and Hulu. Viewers can also stream the debate on the ABC app on a smartphone or tablet, on ABC.com and connected devices.

Trump has worked to peg Harris as a ""California liberal,"" letting voters' perceptions of the progressive bastion paint a picture of a candidate who served as the state's attorney general and junior senator. He's also hammered her on immigration and inflation -- two voter concerns on which polls suggest he has an edge.

However, he's also veered into personal remarks, including falsely questioning Harris' racial identity (she's Black and south Asian), touting what he says are his superior good looks and promoting vulgar and false allegations that past romantic relationships of Harris' helped propel her political career.

Staying on message on his four-year economic record, which saw low inflation before the pandemic and less fervor over unauthorized border crossings, is key, allies told ABC News.

Veering into personal attacks would be counterproductive, they argued, drawing media attention away from what they view as a favorable policy issue set.

""I think he does,"" former White House press secretary Sean Spicer said when asked if Trump makes an effective contrast on the trail. ""If I had a critique, it would be that he'll make the case sometimes and then, with all due respect, he will sometimes go beyond the case and give the media something else to focus on.""

""He needs to avoid creating a moment that takes the focus away from her record. So, if it's about her personality or her appearance as opposed to her record, that will change the focus of what people talk about the next day,"" Spicer said.

How does Harris introduce herself to undecided voters?

While Trump comes in with nearly universal name recognition, 28% of likely voters in a recent New York Times/Siena College poll said they feel they ""need to learn more about Kamala Harris."" That means that while many voters have heard of Harris, she is less defined than Trump in their eyes and thus has more work to do to introduce herself -- lest she be defined by her opposition.

Harris has dual goals in Tuesday's debate: make the case for herself as someone who would be a capable president and get under Trump's skin to spark a reaction to suggest he isn't worthy of another four years in the White House.

""I think there needs to be a long litany of just pummeling Donald Trump while also being extremely clear about what your vision is for the future,"" said Bakari Sellers, a prominent Harris ally and Democratic media commentator.

Harris on the trail has sought to do both.

Monday, she fleshed out her policy proposals in a new page on her website, her most expansive explanation yet of her platform. And in early stump speeches, she boasted of her time working as a prosecutor and state attorney general combating gangs and other criminal activity, saying to crowds that she knows ""Donald Trump's type,"" in a clear reference to his legal travails.

The way she balances those two dictates could offer clues as to the way she and her campaign best think she can march to victory in November.

Will there be any hot mics?

Harris had a memorable debate performance in 2020, when she faced off against then-Vice President Mike Pence. Pence was muscling in on her answers, allowing her to declare, ""I'm speaking,"" in one of the more viral instances of the night.

It's unclear whether she'll be able to replicate such a moment.

The candidates' microphones will be muted while their opponent is answering a question, something Harris' team argued against in the hopes of tempting Trump to aggressively interrupt her and come off as unpresidential.

In an election in which policy is largely taking a backseat to personality, producing such a clash might possibly spark one of the debate's most notable moments.

How big of a role will President Joe Biden play?

Harris has been walking a tightrope since the start of her campaign between recognizing her role in Biden's administration and touting its achievements while also casting herself as a candidate in her own right, particularly after the unusual way in which she became her party's nominee.

A recent New York Times/Siena College poll showed that roughly 61% of likely voters said the next president should represent a major change from Biden. Only 25% of them said Harris represented that change, compared to 53% who said Trump did.

Harris so far has appeared mostly on the campaign trail by herself, and in a joint appearance in Pittsburgh and at Democrats' convention last month, Biden spoke first before handing the stage off to Harris, underscoring her role in the electoral spotlight.

Trump, meanwhile, has at times focused extensively on Biden, particularly in the days and weeks after the president ended his campaign and handed the reins to Harris.

Such a strategy risks focusing too much on Biden rather than Trump's own opponent -- but, allies said, tying Harris to voter disapproval of the way the current president has handled the economy and inflation could be a boon.

""For him to be viewed as having a successful debate, he has to continue that assault,"" said one former campaign aide in touch with Trump's current team. ""She's the vice president United States seeking the second term of Joe Biden. We can make that case.""

Is there a major moment that moves the electoral needle?

The last debate between Biden and Trump was clearly consequential -- it ended the former's campaign. That doesn't mean Tuesday's debate will pack the same punch.

Surely, millions will tune in to the latest salvo in a race packed with unpredictable twists and turns, raising the stakes. But many debates make little more than ripples in presidential races -- an outcome that might benefit neither candidate.

As it stands, it's a neck-and-neck race. Harris would like a moment that revives her momentum, which jolted her into contention but now is stalled; Trump would like a moment to erase some of the gains Harris has made and actually reverse her improved poll numbers."
63,"WASHINGTON (dpa-AFX) - Gold held steady on Tuesday as investors digested mixed Chinese trade data and looked ahead to the release of key U.S. inflation readings this week for additional clues on the size of potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve at its meeting next week.

Spot gold slipped 0.1 percent to $2,503.81 per ounce while U.S. gold futures were little changed with a positive bias at $2,532.9.

The U.S. CPI data is due on Wednesday and the PPI on Thursday. The readings could offer hints about the size of the Federal Reserve's interest rate reduction next week.

CME Group's FedWatch Tool currently indicates a 73 percent chance the Fed will lower rates by 25 basis points and a 29 percent chance of a 50-basis point rate cut.

Meanwhile, with the U.S. election nearing, Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump will face off in a debate for the first time later today.

Elsewhere, the European Central Bank is expected to lower borrowing costs for a second time this year on Thursday due to falling inflation and sluggish growth.

The British pound edged up versus the euro and dollar as new labor market data supported the view that the British economy was on a solid footing.

Capital Economics' economist Ashley Webb said that further easing in British wage growth is a welcome sign but will not be enough to prompt a back-to-back 25 basis points interest rate cut, from 5.00 percent to 4.75 percent in September.

64,"WASHINGTON, Sept 10: House Speaker Mike Johnson is hosting a ceremony Tuesday to posthumously present Congress' highest honour -- the Congressional Gold Medal -- to 13 US service members who were killed during the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, even as the politics of a presidential election swirl around the event.

Both Democrats and Republicans supported the legislation to honour the 13 US troops, who were killed along with more than 170 Afghans in a suicide bombing at Abbey Gate near Kabul's Airport in August 2021.

President Joe Biden signed the legislation in December 2021. The top Republican and Democratic leaders for both the House and Senate are expected to speak at Tuesday's ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda.

The event is taking place against the backdrop of a bitter back and forth over who is to blame for the rushed and deadly evacuation from Kabul. Johnson scheduled the ceremony just hours before the first debate between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump.

House Republicans also released a scathing investigation on Sunday into the withdrawal that cast blame on Biden's administration and minimized the role of Trump, who had signed the withdrawal deal with the Taliban.

Johnson, a Louisiana Republican and Trump ally, praised the House report, which was led by the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Republican Rep. Michael McCaul.

""We must not allow the Biden-Harris Administration to rewrite history,"" Johnson said in a statement. ""The families of the 13 fallen servicemembers and the allies we abandoned in Afghanistan deserve better.""

White House national security spokesman John Kirby on Monday criticised the House report as partisan and one-sided, and said it revealed little new information as well as several inaccuracies. He noted that evacuation plans had started well before the pullout and the US did not hand over equipment to the Taliban. He said the fall of Kabul ""moved a lot faster than anyone could have anticipated.""

He also acknowledged that during the evacuation ""not everything went according to plan. Nothing ever does.""

""We hold ourselves all accountable for that,"" he said of the deaths.

Kirby added there would be ""quite a few"" people from the Department of Defence at the ceremony Tuesday.

The top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, also issued a memorandum in response to the GOP report, saying he was concerned by the ""attempts to politicize the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.""

""Republicans' partisan attempts to garner headlines rather than acknowledge the full facts and substance of their investigation have only increased with the heat of an election season,"" Meeks said.

Pentagon reviews have concluded that the suicide bombing was not preventable, and that suggestions troops may have seen the would-be bomber were not true.

Regardless, Trump has thrust the withdrawal, with the backing from some of the families of the Americans killed, into the centre of his campaign. Last month, his political team distributed video of him attending a wreath-laying ceremony for the fallen service members at Arlington National Cemetery on the third anniversary of the bombing, despite the cemetery's prohibition on partisan activity on the grounds as well as an altercation with a cemetery employee who was trying to make sure the campaign followed those rules.

The Gold Star military families who invited him to the Arlington ceremony have defended Trump's actions. At a fiery news conference outside the Capitol Monday, they implored for the House report to be taken seriously and demanded accountability for those in leadership during evacuation from Kabul.

""President Trump is certainly not perfect. But he's a far better choice, in my opinion, than the mess that Biden and Harris have created since Kabul,"" said Paula Knauss Selph, whose son Ryan Knauss died in the Abbey Gate attack.

While Trump and Republicans have sought to link Harris to the withdrawal as a campaign issue, and Harris has said she was the last person in the room when Biden made his decision, neither watchdog reviews nor the 18-month investigation by House Republicans have identified any instance where the vice president had a significant impact on decision-making.

Still, House Republicans argued that Harris, as well as Biden's national security team, needed to face accountability for the consequences of the deadly withdrawal.

""Kamala Harris wants to be the president of the United States. She wants to be commander in chief. She needs to answer for this report immediately,"" said Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican on the committee.

McCaul, the chairman, also defended the timing of the report by saying that the committee's investigation had to overcome resistance from the Biden administration.

He cast the investigation as a ""truth-seeking mission"" rather than a partisan endeavour, but also bragged that out of all the investigations that House Republicans have launched into the Biden administration in the last two years ""this investigation is the one they fear the most.""

Most assessments have concluded Trump and Biden share blame for the disastrous end to America's longest war, which saw enemy Taliban take over Afghanistan again before the last American troops even flew out of the Kabul airport. The main US government watchdog for the war points to Trump's 2020 deal with the Taliban to withdraw all US forces and military contractors as ""the single most important factor"" in the collapse of US-allied Afghan security forces and Taliban takeover.

Biden's April 2021 announcement that he would proceed with the withdrawal set in motion by Trump was the second-biggest factor, the watchdog said.

Both Trump and Biden kept up the staged withdrawal of US forces, and in Trump's case sharply cut back important US airstrikes in the Taliban, even though the Taliban failed to enter into substantive negotiations with the US-backed civilian government as required by Trump's withdrawal deal. (AP)"
65,"PITTSBURGH -- Ninety minutes Tuesday night may well offer newly anointed but still relatively little-known Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris her last and best chance to define herself for voters, even as Donald Trump tries to do it for her.

The vice president has managed to consolidate most of her party's voting coalition in the seven weeks since President Joe Biden abruptly ended his reelection campaign and threw his support behind her. But her failure to lock down some groups, such as young Black men and Latinos, has left her campaign in a precarious position against the coup-attempting former president with less than two months left until Election Day.

""The challenge for both, in a sense, is to define Harris, as Trump is well-known,"" said David Axelrod, the Democratic consultant who helped Barack Obama win the White House in 2008.

Trump, who has been convicted of 34 felony counts, has spent the duration of her presidential candidacy attacking Harris as a ""Marxist"" and ""communist"" who holds extreme views on cultural issues. Harris has emphasized her résumé as a prosecutor and California's elected attorney general in her attempt to portray herself as a pragmatic centrist.

Recent polling shows that, despite both of their efforts, a significant percentage of Americans say they don't really know much about her. A recent New York Times survey found that 28% of likely voters say they need to know more about Harris, while only 9% say the same about Trump.

One Republican consultant who has worked on multiple presidential campaigns, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he cannot think of a higher-stakes confrontation in the history of modern presidential races.

""I'm not sure I have enough wine handy tomorrow to get me through this debate,"" he said. ""I think it could be a complete game changer. It's going to be the single most important debate after the previous single most important debate that got Biden bounced.""

Tuesday's contest was initially supposed to be the second one between Biden and Trump. That matchup ended, though, in the weeks following Biden's disastrous performance in their first debate of the 2024 election cycle, on June 27. Biden sounded hoarse and looked weak, which his campaign blamed on a cold, and flubbed questions, reinforcing many voters' concerns about his age. At one point, he said he finally ""beat Medicare"" when he meant to take credit for beating the pharmaceutical industry.

Biden's polling numbers cratered in the days and weeks to come, as did his fundraising, and prominent supporters urged him to drop out. On July 21, he announced on social media that he was ending his reelection campaign and followed up shortly with another post endorsing Harris for the nomination.

Tuesday's debate will be hosted by ABC News at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia but will be simulcast by most other broadcast and cable networks. It is scheduled to begin at 9 p.m. EDT.

Harris has spent days holed up at the Omni William Penn Hotel in downtown Pittsburgh, on the other side of the state, to focus on debate preparations. During a brief visit to a nearby spice store Saturday afternoon, she said was ready to face Trump.

Asked what message she hoped to get across, she had ready lines she uses frequently as she presents herself as a ""change"" candidate: ""It's time to turn the page on the divisiveness. It's time to bring our country together. Chart a new way forward.""

Harris' only experience in a national general election debate was in 2020 against then-Vice President Mike Pence. Trump, meanwhile, has now done six general election debates: three against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016, two against Biden in 2020 and the one this June against Biden.

By most accounts, though, Trump has lost five of those, with his tendency to bully his opponents and repeat outrageous, over-the-top lies turning off many viewers. Only in his last encounter with Biden, when the 81-year-old president largely defeated himself with his answers, did Trump tone down his act as Biden faltered.

Both Democratic and Republican consultants and officials agreed that a success for Harris is one where she offers a vision for the country while not getting herself bogged down responding to Trump's likely attacks.

""Kamala needs to show that she is tough enough to handle Trump smartly. Have a commanding presence while being liked enough,"" said former Florida GOP chair Al Cardenas, a vocal Trump critic.

Added current Florida Democratic chair Nikki Fried: ""The bar is set so low for Donald Trump as nothing he says is coherent. She just needs to let Donald be Donald.""

Steve Schale, a Democratic consultant who has worked with a pro-Biden super PAC for years, agreed. ""Just keep doing what she was doing at the convention: Lean into the median voter, and don't let him pull you into his sandbox. As long as he wants to remind people of the chaos that defined his presidency, just let him do it.""

Trump's tendency to remind Americans of his chaos had his supporters hoping that he would find a way to restrain himself.

""I encourage President Trump to stay on the issues, and he's going to beat her on every issue that is important to people, in terms of the border, in terms of the cost of things, in terms of crime, chaos, what we're seeing around the country right now,"" said Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.).

Whether Trump is capable of that, though, is an open question.

""He needs to be more disciplined than he has about trying to tie her to the things people most object to about Biden's record and paint her as more of the same,"" Axelrod said. ""Personal attacks don't help him, but the question is, can he help himself?"""
66,"VALDOSTA, Georgia -- Vivian Childs, a staunch supporter of former President Donald Trump, schooled a roomful of Republicans on how to win over black voters in the battleground state of Georgia.

Focus on Trump's economic policies, on illegal immigration and inflation, the black Baptist minister told the gathered group of volunteers and campaign staff at the former president's newly opened office in the rural city of Valdosta last month.

Tell voters what Trump has done for them and that he will bring the change America needs, she exhorted. ""We are the party of hope,"" she said. ""We are the party of truth.""

There was a mood of urgency at the office, a grand building with white pillars and porches. By Trump's own admission, Georgia has become a must-win state, one he thought he had locked up until Kamala Harris became his Democratic rival in July.

Her late entry ignited a burst of popular enthusiasm, and opinion polls in Georgia show the candidates neck and neck, a huge turnaround from early July when polls showed Trump leading Democratic President Joe Biden by as many as six percentage points.

In particular, an intense battle is being waged for the black voters who make up a third of the state's population, the biggest proportion of black voters in any of the seven battleground states that will decide the Nov. 5 presidential election.

Childs, part of the national ""Black Americans for Trump"" coalition of advocates, conceded the nomination of Harris initially changed the race in Georgia. ""There was a lot of excitement, absolutely,"" she said. ""She's black and a woman.""

She insisted that excitement was fading.

""We have got to stop dividing our country based on how we look,"" she added. ""I'm telling people to talk to black people the same way they talk to white people: look at President Trump's resume, his policies, what he's done for all Americans.""

Reuters spoke to three dozen campaign officials, party chairs, local activist groups, and allies working on behalf of Trump and Harris to get a sense of each candidate's operation in the closely fought state in the 2020 election.

In churches and county fairs, on doorsteps and social media, and across the airwaves, both campaigns are courting black people, a voting bloc that has traditionally leaned heavily Democratic but where Trump has been making gains, according to opinion polls.

""It has gotten really intense in Georgia,"" said Essence Johnson, a black woman who chairs the Democratic Party in Cobb County, a sprawling region outside of Atlanta.

Indeed, at the Pig and Peaches barbecue festival in Cobb County, battle lines were drawn.

The Democratic stall courted voters of color with literature on student loan forgiveness, help for historically black universities, and lowering drug prices. The Republican stall, a hundred yards away, was replete with Spanish-language leaflets and literature focused on inflation, abortion, economic opportunity, and faith.

""A lot of African Americans, Asians and Hispanics have these shared values,"" said Salleigh Grubbs, the Republican county chair, who has been organizing events at schools in the more racially diverse southern part of the county, holding house parties and door knocking in predominately Black neighborhoods.

Cobb County illustrates the demographic changes that have transformed Georgia from a reliably Republican state into a battleground. Once a predominately white, Republican county, it's now 30 percent black, 14 percent Hispanic, and 6 percent Asian.

Johnson, the Cobb County Democratic chair, said Harris's entry in the race had shifted things dramatically. ""It's a reflection in the mirror for a lot of us,"" she said of Harris.

A black men's forum held just before Biden ended his reelection bid on July 21 drew 14 attendees, she said, but 125 people showed up for another held just after Harris entered the race. Sixty people marked a good crowd at county party meetings when Biden was the candidate; 235 people attended once Harris became the nominee.

Before Biden dropped out, Trump's campaign was so confident of victory in Georgia that it had spent less than $3 million on ad buys. Since Harris's emergence, the campaign and an affiliated group responded by sinking more than $30 million into advertising in the state, outspending the Harris campaign through the month of August.

Both sides have committed to spending more than $37 million each in Georgia through Election Day, according to AdImpact, a firm that tracks political advertising.

The Georgia Black Republican Council, which has endorsed Trump, is launching ads on black radio stations in eight metro areas, focused on immigration, the economy, and opposition to abortion, said Camilla J. Moore, the council's chair.

Ads from the Trump campaign are mostly negative, attacking Harris for inflation, blaming her for people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally, and accusing her of being a dangerous liberal.

Janiyah Thomas, black media director at the Trump campaign, said the former president had a proven track record of creating opportunities for the black community.

""To every black American struggling to make ends meet, our message is clear: vote for the candidate who has consistently delivered on promises,"" she added.

In August and September 2019, while Trump was president, the black unemployment rate reached a new low of 5.3 percent. Under Biden, the rate fell even lower, to 4.8 percent, in 2023.

Harris is running ads focused on proposals to lower drug prices, taxing large corporations, and the ultra-wealthy to pay for housing, and tax breaks for working parents.

Harris' campaign said it had been reaching out to black voters across Georgia ""since day one.""

""Vice President Harris is fighting to lower costs for our families, protect our freedoms and make sure everyone in Georgia can not just get by, but get ahead,"" added Porsha White, the campaign's state director.

Trump took about 11 percent of the black vote in Georgia in the 2020 election, according to exit polls. If he were to pull in any higher share in November, he could win the state, said Andra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University.

A poll conducted for CNN during the last week of August showed Harris with a one-percentage-point lead in the state, 48 percent-47 percent, with Trump getting 10 percent of the black vote.

A Trump victory in Georgia would relieve pressure for him to win all three of the midwestern battleground states, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.

Georgia's governor, Brian Kemp, showed that a Republican can increase his share of the black vote in 2022, when he beat a black Democrat, Stacey Abrams, in part because support from black voters jumped 7 percentage points from their first match-up in 2018. Kemp focused on the economy and gun rights, said his former campaign manager, Bobby Saparow.

Bruce LeVell, a black businessman from Atlanta, said Trump's message on pocketbook issues resonated with voters of color.

""Black men especially and some of the women are really taking a look at their wallets,"" said LeVell, who hosted a roundtable of black business owners with Trump when he visited Atlanta in early August.

At the Embassy church in Austell in southern Cobb County, meanwhile, senior pastor B. Dwayne Hardin is also spreading the gospel of conservatism.

At a recent service kicked off with an hour of boisterous gospel songs, Hardin told his black congregation that America is heading towards socialism and that children are being indoctrinated in schools.

He said it was important to vote for people who ""shake things up.""

Afterwards, in his private office, Hardin said he doesn't tell people to vote for Trump, but that Trump is on the right side of the issues such as individual liberty, school choice, and economic empowerment.

""Do not worship the idol of skin color,"" he said he tells his flock."
67,"WASHINGTON, Sept 10 (Reuters) - U.S. small-business confidence fell in August, reversing the prior month's jump amid growing uncertainty ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election and expectations of weak sales.

The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) said on Tuesday its Small Business Optimism Index dropped 2.5 points to 91.2 last month. The index had surged in July to the highest reading since February 2022.

Small business owners tend to lean Republican and some economists had viewed the jump in sentiment as largely driven by politics and a stock market rally following then-Democratic Party candidate President Joe Biden's poor debate performance against Republican Party candidate Donald Trump.

Economists had anticipated a reversal after Biden dropped out of the White House race and handed the baton to Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump and Harris are locked in a tight contest, and the stock market has been lackluster.

The survey's Uncertainty Index increased 2 points to 92, the highest since October 2020. The share of businesses expecting higher inflation-adjusted sales volumes in the next three months fell 9 points to -18%. ""Clearly, 'uncertainty' has been on the rise,"" said NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg. ""And the stock market is expressing some unease ... and the election is just weeks away.""

Though business owners continued to worry about inflation, the share ticked down and fewer reported raising average selling prices. But labor shortages remain a challenge for small businesses, even as job openings in the nation have declined, resulting in a rise in the share of owners planning to raise compensation in the next three months.

Forty percent of all owners reported job openings they could not fill in August, up 2 points from July. Most of the unfilled positions were for skilled workers, and were concentrated in the transportation, construction and manufacturing sectors.

Job creation plans, however, continued to decline. That is in line with the slowdown in nonfarm payrolls gains.

The share of owners planning capital investment increased, with many of them buying new equipment, improving or expanding facilities. A very small minority reported that financing was their top business problem.

The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates next week, kicking off its easing cycle with a 25 basis points reduction. The U.S. central bank has kept its policy rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range for more than a year, having raised it by 525 basis points in 2022 and 2023.

68,"Washington -- Abortion is one of the issues that could drive voters' decisions in the November election, the first presidential contest held since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago and paved the way for 22 states to restrict access to the procedure. Going into the 2024 election, the two presidential nominees, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, have talked about their views of and stances on abortion and and what the future might hold for abortion access if elected.

Democrats are hoping the issue of abortion access will galvanize voters to elect Harris, while Republicans have sought to frame the issue as one best left to the states, while facing questions about whether a federal abortion ban would be on the table if former President Donald Trump were elected to a second term.

An August CBS News poll found that 60% of voters believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, and among women likely voters who want abortion to be legal, 76% support Harris.

Here is where Trump and Harris stand on abortion.

Trump has throughout the campaign had shifting views on abortion, frustrating social conservatives and anti-abortion rights groups that are pushing for a nationwide ban. The Republican nominee has repeatedly taken credit for the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade in June 2022 and touted that three of the justices he appointed to the high court voted to unwind the constitutional right to abortion.

He has said the court's landmark decision means the issue is now left up to voters in the states.

""My view is now that we have abortion where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land,"" he said in a video posted to social media in April.

Trump has stopped short of backing a federal abortion ban, but said during a March radio interview that ""people are agreeing on 15, and I'm thinking in terms of that.""

Still, as Democrats, including Harris, have sought to tie Trump and Republicans to abortion restrictions enacted in 22 states after Roe was reversed, the former president has attempted to counter their attacks.

""My administration will be great for women and their reproductive rights,"" he declared on social media on Aug. 23, the morning after Harris delivered a speech accepting the Democratic presidential nomination that claimed Trump's second-term agenda includes limiting access to birth control, outlawing medication abortion and banning abortion nationwide.

The former president has also criticized some of the most restrictive state laws on abortion -- namely a six-week ban in place in Florida, where he lives -- and said he favors exceptions in cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is at risk. The former president called Florida's ban a ""terrible thing and a terrible mistake.""

He reiterated in an interview with NBC News in September that six weeks is ""too short"" and said he is ""going to be voting that we need more than six weeks.""

Trump's comments earned him swift backlash from conservatives, who criticized him for supporting a proposed amendment to the Florida Constitution that is on the November ballot. The measure would prohibit laws that restrict abortion before fetal viability, generally considered to be between 22 and 24 weeks of pregnancy.

Trump quickly backtracked amid the fallout and said he would be voting ""no"" on the abortion amendment, which, if defeated in November, would leave Florida's six-week ban in place.

Harris has made abortion rights a focal point of her campaign and has worked to connect abortion restrictions enacted in more than 20 states to the Republican nominee, calling them ""Trump abortion bans"" in speeches from the trail.

In her keynote address at the Democratic National Convention accepting the party's presidential nominee, the vice president pledged to sign into law legislation that restores the federal right to abortion -- if such a bill is passed by Congress.

""Ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom, like the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do,"" she said during a campaign event in Savannah.

Harris' campaign website pledges that if elected president, ""she will never allow a national abortion ban to become law. And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide, she will sign it.""

Access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) services became a campaign issue after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled in February that frozen embryos created during the IVF process could be considered children. The decision threatened the availability of IVF services in Alabama and thrust access to fertility treatments into the national conversation, including among the presidential candidates.

Trump announced last month a new plan that would require the federal government to pay for IVF treatments or mandate insurance companies cover costs associated with IVF, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars per cycle.

Harris, though, has pinned the blame for any threats to fertility treatments on Trump, calling him the ""architect of this entire crisis."" The vice president said the Alabama Supreme Court's ruling is a ""direct result"" of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe.

Harris has repeatedly said she supports a woman's right to make decisions about her body and family-planning, and lamented in her convention speech that since Roe's reversal, she has heard stories of couples who have had their IVF treatments cut off."
69,"WASHINGTON (Gray DC) - Tuesday night Americans will see the second debate of the 2024 presidential cycle, but only the first between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. Tuesday's debate in Philadelphia held by ABC comes after some disagreements over the rules of the event.

The duo will square off at the National Constitution Center Tuesday night, moderated by ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis with many of the same rules as CNN's debate in late June. That event proved fateful for President Joe Biden who dropped out of the race following a subpar performance.

Like the showdown in Atlanta, Tuesday there will be no audience, no handwritten notes, no opening statements and microphones will be muted when it is not a candidate's turn to speak. The last rule a point of contention for the Harris campaign which argues Americans should see substantive exchanges between the candidates - and potential outbursts from Donald Trump as seen in past election cycles.

The candidates will be able to offer rebuttals and follow ups. The 90-minute showdown is the first and currently only debate scheduled between these two candidates. A vice-presidential debate hosted by CBS is slated for October 1."
70,"WASHINGTON - Former President Donald Trump has a very basic plan for debating Vice President Kamala Harris - attack, attack, attack - but says he has no idea how it will play out in prime time on Tuesday.

Describing debates as spur-of-the-moment events, Trump braced supporters for the Harris showdown in Philadelphia by citing a quote attributed to 1980s boxing champion Mike Tyson: ""Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.""

""You can go in with all the strategy you want, but you have to sort of feel it out as the debate's taking place,"" Trump said last week during a Fox News town hall in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

That said, Trump and aides said he plans to go after Harris over issues like the economy, inflation, and immigration - and will likely make a few personal attacks, despite admonitions from allies that he stick to the issues.

Trump has also prepared by seeking to lower expectations - and trying to intimidate moderators - by questioning the fairness of the debate sponsors, ABC News.

""It'll be an interesting evening,"" Trump told Fox.

As with previous presidential debates against Democratic foes Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, Trump and his aides said he has prepared in his traditional non-traditional way: Discussions with aides and advisers, interviews, and speeches.

One difference this time around: Debate consultations with former U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who ran for president as a Democrat and ripped Harris during an early primary debate in 2019.

Trump is hoping for the kind of debate he had June 27 against Biden, the incumbent president whose poor performance pretty much pushed him out of the presidential race. The 81-year-old Biden endorsed Harris, his vice president, right after announcing his withdrawal on July 21.

Since then, Trump has oscillated between policy attacks and personal attacks on Harris, even while acknowledging that his advisers are urging him to stick to the issues.

North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who almost wound up as Trump's running mate, told NBC's ""Meet The Press"" that ""when he stays on the issues, policies ... those are the winning issues.""

Trump aides said his top priority is to tie together Harris and Biden in both domestic and foreign policy. ""She owns every failure of the Harris-Biden administration,"" said senior adviser Jason Miller.

Yet since Harris joined the race, Trump has mocked the pronunciation of her first name, her race, and even her laugh. He has falsely accused Harris of being a ""communist"" and a ""Marxist,"" all in unprecedented language for a major party candidate.

Political analysts said pollsters said Trump's conservative base loves the personal attacks, but they tend to turn off moderate and independent voters who believe politics is too negative and divisive.

Pollster Frank Luntz said Trump also risks alienating voters by going off on negative tangents, as he did over the weekend.

On Friday, he held a ""news conference"" in which he took no questions from reporters but complained about the numerous women who have made allegations against him. Over the weekend, he posted angry Truth Social messages threatening to prosecute opponents over alleged campaign ""skullduggery"" during his 2020 election loss to Biden.

""Conditions are favorable for him to win the election,"" Luntz said, but ""just, like in 2020, his persona may sink him.""

Like any boxer, Trump must also be prepared to defend himself.

After the June 27 debate, Democrats said Biden's troubles obscured coverage of the 78-year-old Trump's many lies about their record. Harris and aides indicated they plan to make that an issue during Tuesday's set-to in Philadelphia.

""We should be prepared for the fact that he is not burdened by telling the truth,"" Harris said Monday in an interview with radio host Rickey Smiley, adding that Trump has an ""old and tired playbook.""

While exuding his usual confidence, Trump is also preparing for a possible bad night by engaging in the time-honored practice of lowering expectations.

In this case, Trump has attacked the debate sponsors by claiming that ABC News has been unfair to him; his criticism also looks like an effort to intimidate the questioners.

Discussing his debate plans, Trump told the Fox News town hall that ""it depends a lot on ABC. Will they be fair or not? If they're not going to be fair, I'm going to be a little bit different than if they are.""

Trump made the same sorts of complaints about CNN right before his encounter with Biden.

Aaron Kall, debate coach at the University of Michigan who has watched all of Trump's previous debates over the years, said this is an example of the maverick candidate engaging in more a more traditional form of preparation.

""Lowering expectations,"" he said. ""Working the refs."""
71,"PHILADELPHIA -- Ahead of the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, Pennsylvania's undecided voters want the candidates to discuss the economy, border security, and abortion to aid their decision on whom to vote for.

Trump and Harris will meet at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia on Sept. 10. It is the second debate of the 2024 campaign, following Trump's face-off against President Joe Biden in Atlanta on June 27, with the latter dropping out of the race in July. The Epoch Times spoke with several voters in Pennsylvania who are not yet committed to any candidate to understand how Trump or Harris could persuade them.

Asked what issue she'd like to hear debated, Cyndi McGuinn said, ""[It's] women's rights [to abortion], obviously. ... That's huge right now."" An undecided voter from the Philadelphia suburbs who works at a Whole Foods store, McGuinn added that foreign policy, specifically the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, would also be important.

McGuinn believes Harris is doing a better job at addressing those issues. Harris has made access to abortion a central argument of her campaign, vowing to sign a law that grants abortion access nationwide -- pre-empting bans in conservative states -- and to use the federal government to enhance abortion access.

Other voters reported concerns about domestic policy and Harris's agenda that have prompted them to consider voting for Trump.

Lucera was also concerned about government spending and the national debt. She wanted candidates to describe their plans to reduce the deficit and avoid further spending. ""Our deficit is out of [control]. ... It's ridiculous now. Where's this money coming from?"" she said.

Border security was a common concern among undecided voters who spoke with The Epoch Times, though not everyone was convinced that Harris had failed on the issue.

""I do care a lot about border crossings ... [but] I'm leaning 90 percent towards Harris,"" said Carolyn McIntyre, a voter from Bristol, Pennsylvania.

She expressed concerns about Trump's personality.

""I always voted Republican until Donald Trump came along,"" McIntyre said. ""On paper, a lot of his things look good, but once you put him and who he is into the equation, it changes everything.""

She specifically mentioned Trump's actions on Jan. 6, 2021 -- when he attempted to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election -- as a basis for her objection to him. His behavior during the debate would be a factor in her decision, she said.

Gun control was on voters' minds, as well, after a Sept. 4 shooting at Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia, in which a 14-year-old student, Colt Gray, killed four people. McIntyre said she agreed with the Second Amendment but wanted to hear about stricter gun control measures.

""We need to have incredibly stronger background checks [and] red flags,"" McIntyre said. ""Responsible gun owners need to be investigated, also, because a lot of them are not responsible. They're not locking their guns up. Their 14-year-olds are getting them,"" she said.

Harris has called for more background checks and stricter regulations on the sale of firearms, and has criticized the U.S. Supreme Court for rulings that limit states' gun regulations. Trump has largely opposed more gun restrictions.

Nearly all voters, including those who have decided on their candidate, said the economy, especially the cost of living, was a subject they wished to hear.

""The economy would be one very important [issue],"" said David Zane, an undecided voter from Salem, Pennsylvania. Zane spoke highly of Trump's performance on the issue but was considering voting for Harris so she may become the first woman president.

""[Trump] seems to know what he's doing,"" said Zane, who voted for him in 2020. ""We always need change. ... It's about time [for a woman president].""

Trump and Harris's campaigns did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Epoch Times plans to contact the named voters after the debate for their views on Trump and Harris's performance."
72,"Washington: The second presidential debate is going to be held before the presidential election in the US. Former President Donald Trump and current Vice President Kamala Harris will face each other in this debate. As per Indian time, it can be seen from 7 to 8 am on Wednesday (9 pm on Tuesday according to US time). There will be a political debate between the two leaders during the debate. During the debate, both the leaders will be under pressure to tell their different views about the country. The debate will be held in East Philadelphia. Earlier, the first presidential debate was held on 28 June. Joe Biden and Donald Trump were face to face in the first debate. Trump was seen dominating the debate from the beginning. Trump was declared the winner of the first presidential debate.

President Joe Biden decided to drop out of the presidential race after his disappointing performance. After this, candidates from both parties announced their vice-presidential candidates. Harris wants to show that she can lead the Democratic side against Trump in a better way than Biden. At the same time, Trump is trying to portray the vice-president as an out of touch liberal.

Harris (59) is the first woman, black and person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president. Former Republican President Trump (78) has often resorted to racial and gender stereotypes against her, frustrating her allies who want Trump to instead focus on policy differences with Harris. Kamala Harris has spent most of the last five days in Pennsylvania preparing for the debate. Before the debate, she told radio host Ricky Smiley that she was working on how to respond to Trump if he lies. She said, ""There is no limit to how low he will stoop.""

Before the presidential election in America, debates are held between the candidates on important issues. On the basis of this, voters form their opinion about the candidates. This is called presidential debate. Two such debates are held before the election. The first presidential debate was held between John F. Kennedy of the Democratic Party and Richard Nixon of the Republican Party. Nixon lost the 1960 election and Kennedy became the President. (AP)

Tweet Of US Vice President Kamala Harris

In a post on X, she said, ""As a young girl visiting my grandparents in India, my grandfather took me on his morning walks, where he would discuss the importance of fighting for equality and fighting corruption. He was a retired civil servant who had been part of the movement to win India's independence. My grandmother traveled across India--bullhorn in hand--to speak with women about accessing birth control. Their commitment to public service and fight for a better future live on in me today. Happy National Grandparents Day to all the grandparents who help shape and inspire the next generation.""

Vice President Kamala Harris Nominated As Democratic Nominee For US Presidential Election

Harris was nominated as the Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden quit the presidential race amid mounting concerns over his age, particularly after his poor show in the debate with Donald Trump in June.

If elected president, the 59-year-old Harris would become the first woman in history to become the US president. The vice president is only the second woman ever nominated for the presidency by a major political party.

Vice President Kamala Harris On Former US President Donald Trump's Racial Attacks

Earlier on August 30, CNN's chief political correspondent Dana Bash asked Harris about Donald Trump's racial attacks, most notably when he said his opponent ""wasn't Black enough"".

In response, Harris shook her head, as if speechless, and appeared like she did not want to spend too much airtime on the subject.

About Former US President Donald Trump's Remarks

Former US President Donald Trump had launched a strong personal attack on Harris on August 1, by claiming that she, after being of ""Indian heritage"" for years, ""turned Black"" a few years ago.

""She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn black, and now she wants to be known as black. So I don't know, is she Indian or is she black?"" CNN quoted him as saying."
74,"Philadelphia, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 10th Sep, 2024) Kamala Harris touched down in Philadelphia on Monday on the eve of her first -- and possibly only -- presidential debate with Donald Trump before the knife-edge 2024 US election.

With less than two months until polling day, the face-off could be a turning point in a bitter contest between the Democratic vice president and Republican former president.

Harris's Air Force 2 landed in Pennsylvania's largest city and she will spend the night here, while Trump is not due to arrive until hours before Tuesday evening's primetime clash on ABC news.

The two candidates have never even met before, and the debate is set to be a contrast in styles between a former prosecutor and a convicted felon who has targeted Harris with racist and sexist insults.

""There's no floor for him in terms of how low he will go and we should be prepared for that,"" Harris told radio host Rickey Smiley in an interview broadcast Monday, when asked how she planned to handle Trump's attacks.

""And we should be prepared for the fact that he is probably going to speak a lot of untruths.""

With scandals dogging her rival, who has not committed to accepting the result of November's election if he loses, Harris also has much to prove.

The 59-year-old's honeymoon after replacing an aging Joe Biden at the top of the ticket appears to be fading, with polls showing she needs to reach out to voters who do not know much about her policies.

She addressed the growing pressure late Sunday when her campaign put out a policy page, touching on subjects from unions and cost-of-living issues to health care.

Trump, 78, will be under pressure to rein in his insults and aggression as he goes up against a mixed-race candidate vying to be the first female president in US history.

- 'Not fit to be president' -

But he has experience on his side, with six prior presidential debates under his belt -- and his restrained approach against an imploding Biden in their debate in June proved brutally effective.

Trump struck a typically dark tone in rallies and social media posts over the weekend as he reached out to his right-wing base, at one point warning of ""long prison sentences"" for all those he said were planning on ""cheating"" in November.

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre responded on Monday by saying: ""That kind of rhetoric coming from a former president is dangerous.""

The Harris campaign also targeted Trump in an ad Monday featuring former vice president Mike Pence and other ex-cabinet members saying he was ""not fit to be president again.""

Harris has been holed up for most of the last five days in a hotel in Pittsburgh -- also in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania -- doing intense debate practice sessions with her staff."
75,"WASHINGTON - Former US President Donald Trump said Saturday that Israel is ""doomed"" if Vice President Kamala Harris is elected to the White House in November.

""If I don't win this election, Israel, with comrade Kamala Harris at the helm of the United States, is doomed. Israel is doomed.

""Israel will be gone. One year, two years. Israel will no longer exist,"" Trump told supporters in the state of Wisconsin.

The Republican nominee claimed he is ""the only one"" who can end the chaos in the Middle East and prevent World War III.

""I better win, I better win, or you're going to have problems like we've never had. We may have no country left. It may be our last election,"" he said.

Trump and Harris are gearing up for their first presidential debate, which will be moderated Tuesday by David Muir and Linsey Davis from ABC News at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia."
76,"Philadelphia, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 10th Sep, 2024) Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will clash in their first and possibly last televised debate Tuesday, in a potentially game-changing moment for the blockbuster 2024 US presidential election.

The stakes could hardly be higher for the Democratic vice president and Republican former president as tens of millions of American voters tune in to see them finally face off.

A single zinger or gaffe could tip the balance of one of the most dramatic White House races in US political history, with the two rivals neck-and-neck in the polls with less than two months until election day.

For Harris, 59, it will be a critical chance to win over voters who still know little about her, as her honeymoon starts to fade after suddenly replacing President Joe Biden in July.

Trump, 78, will meanwhile try to box in Harris on issues like the economy and immigration, but may also unleash more of the racist and sexist insults that he's directed her way during the campaign.

The two candidates will also be meeting in person for the first time at the ABC news debate in Pennsylvania, adding to the potential for a bruising confrontation.

""This debate may go down in the history books. Break out the popcorn,"" said Andrew Koneschusky, a former press secretary for US Senate leader Chuck Schumer.

One of her aides even reportedly dressed up in a Trump-style boxy suit and long tie so she could get used to unloading her best lines on her opponent.

Trump's team said he has taken a more relaxed approach ahead of his seventh presidential debate, choosing to arrive in Philadelphia just hours before and keeping his preparations limited.

The debate may lack the full-scale shouting matches of previous years, as the two candidates' microphones will be muted when they are not speaking, at the Trump team's request.

But it will still be a potential turning point -- as well as a contrast in styles.

In one corner is a former prosecutor who has in the past delivered ice-cold put-downs to debate rivals including Biden himself and Trump's former vice president Mike Pence in the past.

""There's no floor for him in terms of how low he will go,"" Harris said in a radio interview broadcast Monday. ""He is probably going to speak a lot of untruths."""
77,"Philadelphia: Police are bracing for protests in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania as presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will go head-to-head in the highly-anticipated presidential debate on Tuesday (local time), their first and possibly only televised debate that will become a crucial factor in the upcoming elections in November. The two will take on each other in a 90-minute debate hosted by ABC News.

However, as with the Democratic National Convention (DNC) last month, police are expecting some form of protests as many pro-Palestinian groups are angry with Harris' continued support of Israel in the 11-month war against Hamas in Gaza. Barricades have been erected around the National Constitution Center, the site of the debate, barring access to the historic area that includes the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall.

Kamala Harris has expressed sympathy with the pro-Palestinian demonstrators who have been staging protests for some months. The DNC had been plagued by these protests, where tens of thousands of people gathered and burned American flags. Despite calling for an urgent ceasefire deal, Harris has so far refused to criticise Israel's approach.

Notably, Democrats have been struggling with the issue of how to handle the Israel-Gaza war since protests erupted in several universities. Protesters have been critical of Harris saying that she wants a ceasefire while the Biden admin is sending money and weapons to Israel, according to Newsweek. These anti-Israel protests have cast a shadow on Harris' run, with experts saying she could lose key swing states.

Harris and Trump will face off at 9 pm ET (6:30 am Wednesday in India) in possibly their only televised debate in Philadelphia. Harris seems to have more to gain or lose from the debate - as several Philadelphia residents said they hoped to learn more about Harris. Top Democrats will gather at a hotel for a watch party that Harris is expected to attend after the debate ends. Trump's plans after the debate are not yet public.

President Joe Biden's faltering debate performance against Trump in June essentially ended his political career, sparking powerful Democrats to convince him he should step aside ahead and allow Harris, his vice president, to run instead. Harris is expected to take lessons from Biden's performance by giving a keener ear to Trump's provocative statements and would focus on calling out Trump's inconsistencies around women's reproductive care in an attempt to portray him as unfit.

Trump and his campaign have spotlighted far-left positions she took during her failed 2020 presidential bid. The former president has argued a Harris presidency is a threat to the safety of the country, highlighting that Biden tapped her to address the influx of migrants as the Republican once again makes dark warnings about immigration and those in the country illegally central to his campaign.

Trump and Harris are effectively tied heading into the final weeks of the election, according to a national poll conducted by The New York Times and Siena College. Trump is up one percentage point, 48-47 per cent, over Harris, according to the survey released on Sunday, well within the survey's three-point margin of error.

The poll notably showed that voters feel they need to learn more about Harris, while their opinions on Trump are largely set. In the survey, Around 28 per cent of likely voters said they needed more information about the Democratic nominee, while only 9 per cent said the same about Trump. Most opinion polls show Harris to be slightly ahead nationally and in the majority of battleground states, but Trump remains well within striking distance to win the November 5 election.

78,"Washington DC [US], September 10 (ANI): Tesla CEO Elon Musk criticised the Democratic Party over the issue of illegal immigration while claiming that the upcoming presidential polls will mark the ""last real election"" in the United States if Donald Trump loses.

The billionaire alleged that the Democrats want to legalise 15 million illegal migrants and bring more, which can help them win the swing states and turn America into a ""one-party state.""

""The publicly-stated goal by almost all leaders of the Democratic Party is to legalize the ~15 million illegal migrants as soon as possible, as well as bring in tens of millions more. That would immediately make all swing states deep blue, just like happened in California with the 1986 amnesty, turning America into a permanent one-party state. This is the last real election if Trump loses,"" Musk stated in a post on X.

Notably, illegal immigration is a major issue in the United States over which the Democrats and Republicans spar regularly with contrasting stands.

Vice President Kamala Harris has vowed to establish an ""earned pathway to citizenship"" for the illegal migrants.

""She knows that our immigration system is broken and needs comprehensive reform that includes strong border security and an earned pathway to citizenship,"" Harris' campaign website reads, as cited by the New York Post.

On the other hand, former President Donald Trump, who Harris is going up against for the White House, has claimed he will enact a large deportation initiative to expel illegal migrants from the US.

Elon Musk has been regularly expressing support for Donald Trump in the elections scheduled on November 5.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, if elected, has pledged to set up a new task force, headed by Musk, to conduct a complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government and make recommendations for drastic reforms.

Elon Musk has welcomed Trump's decision, stating, ""This is badly needed.""

In a separate interview, Trump even said that he would like to keep Elon Musk in his cabinet if he's elected as President. (ANI)"
79,"Washington: Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will meet for the first time face-to-face Tuesday night for perhaps their only debate, a high-pressure opportunity to showcase their starkly different visions for the country after a tumultuous campaign summer.

The event, at 9 pm Eastern in Philadelphia, will offer Americans their most detailed look at a campaign that's dramatically changed since the last debate in June.

In rapid fashion, President Joe Biden bowed out of the race after his disastrous performance, Trump survived an assassination attempt and bothsides chose their running mates.

Harris is intent on demonstrating that she can press the Democratic case against Trump better than Biden did. Trump, in turn, is trying to paint the vice president as an out-of-touch liberal while trying to win over voters sceptical he should return to the White House.

Trump, 78, has struggled to adapt to Harris, 59, who is the first woman, Black person and person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president.

The Republican former president has at times resorted to invoking racial and gender stereotypes, frustrating allies who want Trump to focus instead on policy differences with Harris.

The vice president, for her part, will try to claim a share of credit for the Biden administration's accomplishments while also addressing its low moments and explaining her shifts away from more liberal positions she took in the past.

The debate will subject Harris, who has sat for only a single formal interview in the past six weeks, to a rare moment of sustained questioning.

""If she performs great, it's going to be a nice surprise for the Democrats and they'll rejoice,"" said Ari Fleischer, a Republican communications strategist and former press secretary to President George W. Bush.

""If she flops, like Joe Biden did, it could break this race wide open. So there's more riding on it.""

Tim Hogan, who led Sen. Amy Klobuchar's debate preparations in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, said Harris, a former California attorney general, would bring a ""prosecutor's instincts to the debate stage.""

""That is a very strong quality in that setting: having someone who knows how to land a punch and how to translate it,"" Hogan said.

The first early ballots of the presidential race will go out just hours after the debate, hosted by ABC ews. Absentee ballots are set to be sent out beginning Wednesday in Alabama.

Trump plans to hit Harris as too liberal

Trump and his campaign have spotlighted far-left positions she took during her failed 2020 presidential bid. He's been assisted in his informal debate prep sessions by Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate who tore into Harris during their primary debates.

Harris has sought to defend her shifts away from liberal causes to more moderate stances on fracking, expanding Medicare for all and mandatory gun buyback programmes -- and even backing away from her position that plastic straws should be banned -- as pragmatism, insisting that her ""values remain the same."" Her campaign on Monday published a page on its website listing her positions on key issues.

The former president has argued a Harris presidency is a threat to the safety of the country, highlighting that Biden tapped her to address the influx of migrants as the Republican once again makes dark warnings about immigration and those in the country illegally central to his campaign.

He has sought to portray a Harris presidency as the continuation of Biden's still-unpopular administration, particularly his economic record, as voters still feel the bite of inflation even as it has cooled in recent months.

Trump's team insist his tone won't be any different facing a female opponent.

""President Trump is going to be himself,"" senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters during a phone call Monday.

Gabbard, who was also on the call, added that Trump ""respects women and doesn't feel the need to be patronising or to speak to women in any other way than he would speak to a man.""

His advisers suggest Harris has a tendency to express herself in a ""word salad"" of meaningless phrases, prompting Trump to say last week that his debate strategy was to ""let her talk.""

The former president frequently plows into rambling remarks that detour from his policy points. He regularly makes false claims about the last election, attacks a lengthy list of enemies and opponents working against him, offers praise for foreign strongmen and comments about race, like his false claim in July that Harris recently ""happened to turn Black.""

Harris wants to argue Trump is unstable and unfit

The vice president, who has been the Biden administration's most outspoken supporter of abortion access after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, is expected to focus on calling out Trump's inconsistencies around women's reproductive care, including his announcement that he will vote to protect Florida's six-week abortion ban in a statewide referendum this fall.

Harris was also set to try to portray herself as a steadier hand to lead the nation and safeguard its alliances, as war rages in Ukraine more than two years after Russia's invasion and Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza drags on with no end in sight.

She is likely to warn that Trump presents a threat to democracy, from his attempts in 2020 to overturn his loss in the presidential election, spurring his angry supporters to attack the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, through comments he made as recently as last weekend.

Trump on social media issued yet another message of retribution, threatening that if he wins he will jail ""those involved in unscrupulous behaviour,"" including lawyers, political operatives, donors, voters and election officials.

Harris has spent the better part of the last five days ensconced in debate preparations in Pennsylvania, where she participated in hours-long mock sessions with a Trump stand-in.

Ahead of the debate, she told radio host Rickey Smiley that she was workshopping how to respond if Trump lies.

""There's no floor for him in terms of how low he will go,"" she said. (AP)"
80,"WASHINGTON, D.C.: The White House is reportedly considering blocking Nippon Steel's proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel as a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) nears its conclusion.

According to The Washington Post, President Joe Biden is expected to halt the deal, aligning with his previous objections in support of the United Steelworkers union, which opposes the acquisition. U.S. Steel, a major employer in Pennsylvania-a key swing state-has long been a symbol of American industry, making the issue politically charged in an election year.

Vice President Kamala Harris also opposed the merger, joining Biden in the stance. Former President Donald Trump has similarly stated he would block the deal if he were in office. As news of Biden's likely move to stop the acquisition surfaced, U.S. Steel's stock dropped about 17 percent.

CFIUS, which reviews deals with potential national security implications, is expected to deliver its recommendation soon. U.S. Steel's spokesperson Amanda Malkowski said that no updates have been provided and insisted there are ""no national security issues associated with this transaction,"" given Japan's status as a close ally. Nippon Steel's representative echoed that sentiment, urging the U.S. government to handle the process lawfully.

""We fully expect to pursue all possible options for Pennsylvania, American steelmaking, and all of our stakeholders, closes,"" Malkowski said.

Nippon Steel, which announced the deal in December 2023, argues that it is the only company capable of making an investment to strengthen the U.S. steel sector. U.S. Steel, in a statement supporting the acquisition, warned that without the deal, it would have to reduce operations at its blast furnace facilities, potentially leading to significant job losses and harming local communities."

82,"CHICAGO (AP) - For Christopher Pugh, the 2020 election was a turning point.

He already distrusted the government. But as he watched Fox News coverage in the immediate aftermath of the election and read posts on Twitter, the social media platform now known as X, that distrust grew. He now believes the falsehood that the 2020 election was stolen and trusts few people other than former President Donald Trump to deliver him news about election results.

""I trust Donald Trump, not the government,"" said the 38-year-old Republican from Gulfport, Mississippi. ""That´s it.""

While most Americans trust government-certified election results at least a ""moderate"" amount, Republicans are more likely to trust Trump and his campaign, according to a new survey from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and USAFacts. Americans also are heading into the November election with concerns about misinformation. Many have low trust that the information they receive from presidential candidates - particularly Trump, but also Vice President Kamala Harris - is based on factual information.

Trump continues to lie about the outcome of the 2020 election, saying it was rigged against him even after dozens of his court challenges failed, reviews, recounts and audits in battleground states all affirmed President Joe Biden's win, and Trump's own attorney general said there was no evidence of widespread fraud. Despite no evidence of any widespread fraud, a 2023 poll found that most Republicans believe Biden was not legitimately elected president.

As Trump runs as the Republican candidate for the third time, he also is signaling that he can only lose through widespread fraud. Over the weekend he threatened to prosecute those ""involved in unscrupulous behavior"" this election should he win in November.

""The only way they can beat us is to cheat,"" Trump said at a Las Vegas rally in June.

The recent findings from the AP-NORC survey show that a significant chunk of Trump's supporters might be more inclined to believe what he says about the upcoming election results than they are to trust government certifications of election results.

About two-thirds of Republicans trust Trump's campaign at least a moderate amount to provide accurate information about the results of the 2024 election, while only about half say the same about the official certifications of results, the survey found. By contrast, about 9 in 10 Democrats trust the government certification at least a moderate amount, and an overwhelming majority, 82%, also have at least a moderate amount of trust in Harris and her campaign.

Most Americans - around 7 in 10 - trust the government certifications of election results at least a moderate amount, according to the survey. Majorities also trust national and local TV news networks, as well as local or national newspapers, to provide accurate information about the outcome of this year's presidential election.

Danielle Almeida, a 45-year-old Democrat from Briarcliff Manor, New York, said she trusts government-certified election results and finds it alarming that some Americans don´t.

""In order to have a democracy, we have to trust the system and the results of our elections,"" she said, adding that she thinks Trump ""does not care about fact-checking because he believes his supporters don´t care, either.""

Americans are less likely to trust the campaigns overall - compared to sources such as the government and the media - but they have a higher level of trust in Harris and her campaign than in Trump and his campaign to provide accurate information about the outcome of the election. About half have at least a ""moderate"" amount of trust in Harris and her campaign. By contrast, about 4 in 10 have at least a moderate amount of trust in Trump and his campaign.

Some Republicans' distrust of election results started far before the 2020 election.

Richard Baum, 60, a conservative independent from Odessa, Texas, said his suspicions began in the 2000 U.S. presidential race between George W. Bush and Al Gore. After Bush won by a slim margin, ""hanging chads"" became an unlikely symbol of a disputed presidential election as small anomalies common in elections ballooned into major national controversies.

""There was some stuff there that didn´t seem right that made a lot of doubts in my mind about if you can trust the government,"" Baum said.

Baum said he would trust election results only if voting took place on only a single day, early voting and mail-in ballots were banned and photo IDs were required at all polling places.

Many Americans doubt the veracity of both presidential candidates´ campaign messages, but skepticism about Trump´s campaign is higher, the USAFacts/AP-NORC survey found.

About 6 in 10 Americans believe that Trump´s campaign messages are ""rarely"" or ""never"" based on factual information, compared to 45% who say that about Harris´ campaign messages.

Many Americans also say it's hard to discern fact from fiction when it comes to the candidates. Slightly less than half of Americans say it´s ""very easy"" or ""somewhat easy"" to find factual information about the candidates and their positions, and only about one-third say it´s easy to know if what candidates are saying is true or not.

About 6 in 10 Americans say it´s easy for them to understand the difference between fact and opinion when it comes to information about the upcoming presidential election, but only about 4 in 10 say it´s easy to know whether information is true or not.

Americans are, however, more confident about factual information related to election logistics: About 7 in 10 Americans say it´s easy to find information about how to register to vote, and about 6 in 10 say it´s easy to find information about how to cast their ballot.

Michele Martin, a 56-year-old Pennsylvania Democrat, said she is ""very concerned"" about misinformation from politicians but finds it much easier to access basic voter information.

""It´s online. It´s mailed to you. It´s not hard to find,"" she said.

About 8 in 10 Americans say that when it comes to getting information about the government, the spread of misinformation is a ""major problem."" That is essentially unchanged from when the question was asked in 2020.

Lisa Kuda, a 57-year-old Republican from Palm Harbor, Florida, said she gets most of her news from social media and friends. She said she feels alienated from most news sources other than Fox News.

""Misinformation is everywhere,"" she said. ""It´s really difficult to find information about candidates.""

When Americans see news about the election and want to find out whether it´s true, 40% say they turn to an internet search first. Much smaller shares - around 1 in 10 for each - say they first check cable news, national TV news or social media.

Baum, from Texas, said he finds it difficult to easily access information about candidates because he believes social media platforms ""are censoring conservative ideologies."" He also doesn´t trust Google and instead turns to conservative networks and podcasts such One America News and conservative podcasters to fact-check claims he´s unsure about.

Almeida´s process looks much different. She starts with a Google search and wades through multiple articles from news outlets such as The New York Times and NBC News, making note of any differences. If multiple articles have the same information, she said, she´s more likely to trust it.

""Misinformation is a huge problem,"" she said. ""You have to take time to do your research.""

83,"WASHINGTON (AP) - House Speaker Mike Johnson is hosting a ceremony Tuesday to posthumously present Congress' highest honor - the Congressional Gold Medal - to 13 U.S. service members who were killed during the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, even as the politics of a presidential election swirl around the event.

Both Democrats and Republicans supported the legislation to honor the 13 U.S. troops, who were killed along with more than 170 Afghans in a suicide bombing at Abbey Gate near Kabul's Airport in August 2021. President Joe Biden signed the legislation in December 2021. The top Republican and Democratic leaders for both the House and Senate are expected to speak at Tuesday´s ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda.

The event is taking place against the backdrop of a bitter back and forth over who is to blame for the rushed and deadly evacuation from Kabul. Johnson scheduled the ceremony just hours before the first debate between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump.

House Republicans also released a scathing investigation on Sunday into the withdrawal that cast blame on Biden´s administration and minimized the role of Trump, who had signed the withdrawal deal with the Taliban.

Johnson, a Louisiana Republican and Trump ally, praised the House report, which was led by the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Republican Rep. Michael McCaul.

""We must not allow the Biden-Harris Administration to rewrite history,"" Johnson said in a statement. ""The families of the 13 fallen servicemembers and the allies we abandoned in Afghanistan deserve better.""

White House national security spokesman John Kirby on Monday criticized the House report as partisan and one-sided, and said it revealed little new information as well as several inaccuracies. He noted that evacuation plans had started well before the pullout and the U.S. did not hand over equipment to the Taliban. He said the fall of Kabul ""moved a lot faster than anyone could have anticipated.""

He also acknowledged that during the evacuation ""not everything went according to plan. Nothing ever does.""

""We hold ourselves all accountable for that,"" he said of the deaths.

Kirby added there would be ""quite a few"" people from the Department of Defense at the ceremony Tuesday.

The top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, also issued a memorandum in response to the GOP report, saying he was concerned by the ""attempts to politicize the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.""

""Republicans´ partisan attempts to garner headlines rather than acknowledge the full facts and substance of their investigation have only increased with the heat of an election season,"" Meeks said.

Pentagon reviews have concluded that the suicide bombing was not preventable, and that suggestions troops may have seen the would-be bomber were not true.

Regardless, Trump has thrust the withdrawal, with the backing from some of the families of the Americans killed, into the center of his campaign. Last month, his political team distributed video of him attending a wreath-laying ceremony for the fallen service members at Arlington National Cemetery on the third anniversary of the bombing, despite the cemetery´s prohibition on partisan activity on the grounds as well as an altercation with a cemetery employee who was trying to make sure the campaign followed those rules.

The Gold Star military families who invited him to the Arlington ceremony have defended Trump's actions. At a fiery news conference outside the Capitol Monday, they implored for the House report to be taken seriously and demanded accountability for those in leadership during evacuation from Kabul.

""President Trump is certainly not perfect. But he´s a far better choice, in my opinion, than the mess that Biden and Harris have created since Kabul,"" said Paula Knauss Selph, whose son Ryan Knauss died in the Abbey Gate attack.

While Trump and Republicans have sought to link Harris to the withdrawal as a campaign issue, and Harris has said she was the last person in the room when Biden made his decision, neither watchdog reviews nor the 18-month investigation by House Republicans have identified any instance where the vice president had a significant impact on decision-making.

Still, House Republicans argued that Harris, as well as Biden's national security team, needed to face accountability for the consequences of the deadly withdrawal.

""Kamala Harris wants to be the president of the United States. She wants to be commander in chief. She needs to answer for this report immediately,"" said Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican on the committee.

McCaul, the chairman, also defended the timing of the report by saying that the committee's investigation had to overcome resistance from the Biden administration.

He cast the investigation as a ""truth-seeking mission"" rather than a partisan endeavor, but also bragged that out of all the investigations that House Republicans have launched into the Biden administration in the last two years ""this investigation is the one they fear the most.""

Most assessments have concluded Trump and Biden share blame for the disastrous end to America´s longest war, which saw enemy Taliban take over Afghanistan again before the last American troops even flew out of the Kabul airport. The main U.S. government watchdog for the war points to Trump´s 2020 deal with the Taliban to withdraw all U.S. forces and military contractors as ""the single most important factor"" in the collapse of U.S.-allied Afghan security forces and Taliban takeover.

Biden´s April 2021 announcement that he would proceed with the withdrawal set in motion by Trump was the second-biggest factor, the watchdog said.

Both Trump and Biden kept up the staged withdrawal of U.S. forces, and in Trump´s case sharply cut back important U.S. airstrikes in the Taliban, even though the Taliban failed to enter into substantive negotiations with the U.S.-backed civilian government as required by Trump´s withdrawal deal.

84,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- This year's presidential race is a genuine contest of ideas between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump -- with clear differences on taxes, abortion, immigration, global alliances, climate change and democracy itself.

Since replacing President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee, Harris has pledged to chart a new way forward even as she has embraced many of his ideas. She wants middle class tax cuts, tax hikes on the wealthy and corporations, a restoration of abortion rights and a government that aggressively addresses climate change, among other stances.

Seeking a return to the White House, Trump wants to accomplish much of what he couldn't do during a term that was sidetracked by the global pandemic. The Republican wants the extension and expansion of his 2017 tax cuts, a massive increase in tariffs, more support for fossil fuels and a greater concentration of government power in the White House.

The two candidates have spelled out their ideas in speeches, advertisements and other venues. Many of their proposals lack specifics, making it difficult to judge exactly how they would translate their intentions into law or pay for them. While the candidates agree on not taxing workers' tips, the outcome in November could drastically change the tax code, America's support for Ukraine, abortion access and the commitments made to limit the damage caused by climate change.

HARRIS: The vice president has called on Congress to pass legislation guaranteeing in federal law abortion access, a right that stood for nearly 50 years before being overturned by the Supreme Court. Like Biden, Harris has criticized bans on abortion in Republican-controlled states and promised as president to block any potential nationwide ban should one clear a future GOP-run Congress. Harris was the Democrats' most visible champion of abortion rights even while Biden was still in the race. She has promoted the administration's efforts short of federal law -- including steps to protect women who travel to access the procedure and limit how law enforcement collects medical records.

TRUMP: The former president often brags about appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade. After dodging questions about when in pregnancy he believes the procedure should be restricted, Trump announced last spring that decisions on access and cutoffs should be left to the states. He has said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law if one landed on his desk and recently said he would not try to block access to abortion medication. He told Time magazine that it should also be left up to states to determine whether to prosecute women for abortions or to monitor their pregnancies. He has also said that, if he wins, he wants to make IVF treatment free for women.

Climate/Energy

HARRIS: As a senator from California, the vice president was an early sponsor of the Green New Deal, a sweeping series of proposals meant to swiftly move the U.S. to fully green energy that is championed by the Democratic Party's most progressive wing. Harris also said during her short-lived 2020 presidential campaign that she opposed offshore drilling for oil and hydraulic fracturing. But during her three and a half years as vice president, Harris has adopted more moderate positions, focusing instead on implementing the climate provisions of the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act. That provided nearly $375 billion for things like financial incentives for electric cars and clean energy projects. The Biden administration has also enlisted more than 20,000 young people in a national ""Climate Corps,"" a Peace Corps-like program to promote conservation through tasks such as weatherizing homes and repairing wetlands. Despite that, it's unlikely that the U.S. will be on track to meet Biden's goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 -- a benchmark that Harris hasn't talked about in the early part of her own White House bid.

TRUMP: His mantra for one of his top policy priorities: ""DRILL, BABY, DRILL."" Trump, who in the past cast climate change as a ""hoax"" and harbors a particular disdain for wind power, says it's his goal for the U.S. to have the cheapest energy and electricity in the world and has claimed he can cut prices in half within a year of his potential return to office. He'd increase oil drilling on public lands, offer tax breaks to oil, gas and coal producers, speed the approval of natural gas pipelines, open dozens of new power plants, including nuclear facilities, and roll back the Biden administration's aggressive efforts to get people to switch to electric cars, which he argues have a place but shouldn't be forced on consumers. He has also pledged to re-exit the Paris Climate Accords, end wind subsidies and eliminate regulations imposed and proposed by the Biden administration targeting energy-inefficient kinds of lightbulbs, stoves, dishwashers and shower heads.

Democracy/Rule of Law

HARRIS: Like Biden, Harris has decried Trump as a threat to the nation's democracy. But, in attacking her opponent, the vice president has leaned more heavily into her personal background as a prosecutor and contrasted that with Trump being found guilty of 34 felony counts in a New York hush money case and in being found liable for fraudulent business practices and sexual abuse in civil court. The vice president has also talked less frequently than Biden did about Trump's denial that he lost the 2020 presidential election and his spurring on the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol. When she's interrupted during rallies with supporters' ""Lock him up!"" chants directed at Trump, Harris responds that the courts can ""handle that"" and that ""our job is to beat him in November.""

TRUMP: After refusing to accept his loss to Biden in 2020, Trump hasn't committed to accepting the results this time around. He's repeatedly promised to pardon the Jan. 6 defendants jailed for assaulting police officers and other crimes during the attack on the Capitol, and recently threatened to jail lawyers, election officials, donors and others ""involved in unscrupulous behavior"" surrounding November's vote, again stoking unfounded fears. He vows to overhaul the Justice Department and FBI ""from the ground up,"" aggrieved by the criminal charges the department has brought against him. He also promises to deploy the National Guard to cities such as Chicago that are struggling with violent crime and in response to protests, and has also vowed to appoint a special prosecutor to go after Biden.

Federal government

HARRIS: Like Biden, Harris has campaigned hard against ""Project 2025,"" a plan authored by leading conservatives to move as swiftly as possible to dramatically remake the federal government and push it to the right if Trump wins back the White House. She is also part of an administration that is already taking steps to make it harder for any mass firings of civil servants to occur. In April, the Office of Personnel Management issued a new rule that would ban federal workers from being reclassified as political appointees or other at-will employees, thus making them easier to dismiss. That was in response to Schedule F, a 2020 executive order from Trump that reclassified tens of thousands of federal workers to make firing them easier.

TRUMP: The former president has sought to distance himself from ""Project 2025,"" despite his close ties to many of its key architects. He has nonetheless vowed his own overhaul of the federal bureaucracy, which he has long blamed for blocking his first term agenda, saying: ""I will totally obliterate the deep state."" The former president plans to reissue the Schedule F order stripping civil service protections. He says he'd then move to fire ""rogue bureaucrats,"" including those who ""weaponized our justice system,"" and the ""warmongers and America-Last globalists in the Deep State, the Pentagon, the State Department, and the national security industrial complex."" Trump has also pledged to terminate the Education Department and wants to curtail the independence of regulatory agencies like the Federal Communications Commission. As part of his effort to cut government waste and red tape, he has also pledged to eliminate at least 10 federal regulations for every new one imposed.

Immigration

HARRIS: Attempting to defuse a GOP line of political attack, the vice president has talked up her experience as California attorney general, saying she walked drug smuggler tunnels and successfully prosecuted gangs that moved narcotics and people across the border. Early in his term, Biden made Harris his administration's point person on the root causes of migration. Trump and top Republicans now blame Harris for a situation at the U.S.-Mexico border that they say is out of control due to policies that were too lenient. Harris has countered that Trump worsened the situation by killing a bipartisan Senate compromise that would have included tougher asylum standards and hiring more border agents, immigration judges and asylum officers. She said she would bring back that bill and sign that law, saying that Trump ""talks the talk, but doesn't walk the walk"" on immigration. The vice president has endorsed comprehensive immigration reform, seeking pathways to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. without legal status, with a faster track for young immigrants living in the country illegally who arrived as children.

TRUMP: The former president promises to mount the largest domestic deportation in U.S. history -- an operation that could involve detention camps and the National Guard. He'd bring back policies he put in place during his first term, like the Remain in Mexico program and Title 42, which placed curbs on migrants on public health grounds. And he'd revive and expand the travel ban that originally targeted citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. After the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, he pledged new ""ideological screening"" for immigrants to bar ""dangerous lunatics, haters, bigots, and maniacs."" He'd also try to deport people who are in the U.S. legally but harbor ""jihadist sympathies."" He'd seek to end birthright citizenship for people born in the U.S. whose parents are both in the country illegally.

Israel/Gaza

HARRIS: Harris says Israel has a right to defend itself, and she's repeatedly decried Hamas as a terrorist organization. But the vice president might also have helped defuse some backlash from progressives by being more vocal about the need to better protect civilians during fighting in Gaza.

More than 40,900 Palestinians have been killed in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and militants in its count, but says that women and children make up just over half of the dead. Israel says it has killed more than 17,000 militants in the war.

Like Biden, Harris supports a proposed hostage for extended cease-fire deal that aims to bring all remaining hostages and Israeli dead home. Biden and Harris say the deal could lead to a permanent end to the grinding war and they have endorsed a two-state solution, which would have Israel existing alongside an independent Palestinian state.

TRUMP: The former president has expressed support for Israel's efforts to ""destroy"" Hamas, but he's also been critical of some of Israel's tactics. He says the country must finish the job quickly and get back to peace. He has called for more aggressive responses to pro-Palestinian protests at college campuses and applauded police efforts to clear encampments. Trump also proposes to revoke the student visas of those who espouse antisemitic or anti-American views and deport those who support Hamas.

LGBTQ+ issues

HARRIS: During her rallies, Harris accuses Trump and his party of seeking to roll back a long list of freedoms including the ability ""to love who you love openly and with pride."" She leads audiences in chants of ""We're not going back."" While her campaign has yet to produce specifics on its plans, she's been part of a Biden administration that regularly denounces discrimination and attacks against the LGBTQ+ community. Early in Biden's term, his administration reversed an executive order from Trump that had largely banned transgender people from military service, and his Education Department issued a rule that says Title IX, the 1972 law that was passed to protect women's rights, also bars discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. That rule was silent on the issue of transgender athletes.

TRUMP: The former president has pledged to keep transgender women out of women's sports and says he will ask Congress to pass a bill establishing that ""only two genders,"" as determined at birth, are recognized by the United States. He promises to ""defeat the toxic poison of gender ideology."" As part of his crackdown on gender-affirming care, he would declare that any health care provider that participates in the ""chemical or physical mutilation of minor youth"" no longer meets federal health and safety standards and bar them from receiving federal money. He'd take similarly punitive steps in schools against any teacher or school official who ""suggests to a child that they could be trapped in the wrong body."" Trump would support a national prohibition of hormonal or surgical intervention for transgender minors and bar transgender people from military service.

NATO/Ukraine

HARRIS: The vice president has yet to specify how her positions on Russia's war with Ukraine might differ from Biden's, other than to praise the president's efforts to rebuild alliances unraveled by Trump, particularly NATO, a critical bulwark against Russian aggression. The Biden administration has pledged unceasing support for Ukraine against Russia's invasion. The government has sent tens of billions of dollars in military and other aid to Ukraine, including a tranche of aid that totaled $61 billion in weapons, ammunition and other assistance that is expected to last through the end of this year. The administration has maintained that continuing U.S. assistance is critical because Russian leader Vladimir Putin will not stop at invading Ukraine. Harris has said previously that it would be foolish to risk global alliances the U.S. has established and decried Putin's ""brutality.""

TRUMP: The former president has repeatedly taken issue with U.S. aid to Ukraine and says he will continue to ""fundamentally reevaluate"" the mission and purpose of the NATO alliance if he returns to office. He has claimed, without explanation, that he will be able to end the war before his inauguration by bringing both sides to the negotiating table. (His approach seems to hinge on Ukraine giving up at least some of its Russian-occupied territory in exchange for a cease-fire.) On NATO, he has assailed member nations for years for failing to hit agreed-upon military spending targets. Trump drew alarms this year when he said that, as president, he had warned leaders that he would not only refuse to defend nations that don't hit those targets, but ""would encourage"" Russia ""to do whatever the hell they want"" to countries that are ""delinquent.""

Tariffs/Trade

HARRIS: The Biden-Harris administration has sought to boost trade with allies in Europe, Asia and North America, while using tariffs and other tools to go after rivals such as China. The Democratic administration kept Trump's tariffs on China in place, while adding a ban on exporting advanced computer chips to that country and providing incentives to boost U.S. industries. In May, the Biden-Harris administration specifically targeted China with increased tariffs on electric vehicles and steel and aluminum, among other products.

TRUMP: The former president wants a dramatic expansion of tariffs on nearly all imported foreign goods, saying that ""we're going to have 10% to 20% tariffs on foreign countries that have been ripping us off for years."" He's suggested tariffs as high as 100% on Chinese goods. He treats these taxes as a way to fund other tax cuts, lower the deficit and possibly fund child care -- though the tariffs could raise prices for consumers without generating the revenues Trump promises. He would also urge Congress to pass legislation giving the president authority to impose a reciprocal tariff on any country that imposes one on the U.S. Much of his trade agenda has focused on China. Trump has proposed phasing out Chinese imports of essential goods including electronics, steel and pharmaceuticals and wants to ban Chinese companies from owning U.S. infrastructure in sectors such as energy, technology and farmland.

Taxes

HARRIS: With much of the 2017 tax overhaul expiring at end of next year, Harris is pledging tax cuts for more than 100 million working and middle class households. In addition to preserving some of the expiring cuts, she wants to make permanent a tax credit of as much as $3,600 per child and offer a special $6,000 tax credit for new parents. Harris says her administration would expand tax credits for first-time homebuyers and push to build 3 million new housing units in four years, while wiping out taxes on tips and endorsing tax breaks for entrepreneurs. Like Biden, she wants to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% and the corporate minimum tax to 21%. The current corporate rate is 21% and the corporate minimum, raised under the Inflation Reduction Act, is at 15% for companies making more than $1 billion a year. But Harris would not increase the capital gains tax as much as Biden had proposed on investors with more than $1 million in income.

TRUMP: The former president has promised to extend and even expand all of the 2017 tax cuts that he signed into law, while also paying down the debt. He has proposed cutting the overall corporate tax rate to 15% from 21% -- but only for companies that make their products in the U.S. He would repeal any tax increases signed into law by Biden. He also aims to gut some of the tax breaks that Biden put into law to encourage the development of renewable energy and EVs. Trump has proposed eliminating taxes on tips received by workers -- a policy embraced by Harris, who would also raise the minimum wage for tipped workers -- as well as eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits. He also wants to lower the cost of housing by opening up federal land to development. Outside analyses suggest that Trump's ideas would do much more to increase budget deficits than what Harris would do, without delivering the growth needed to minimize any additional debt."
85,"WASHINGTON -- House Speaker Mike Johnson will hold a ceremony Tuesday to posthumously award Congress' highest honor, the Congressional Gold Medal, to 13 U.S. service members killed during the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, amid the politics of a presidential elections swirl around the event.

Both Democrats and Republicans supported the legislation to honor the 13 U.S. soldiers who were killed along with more than 170 Afghans in a suicide bombing at Abbey Gate, near Kabul airport in August 2021. President Joe Biden signed the legislation in December 2021. Top Republican and Democratic leaders for both the House and Senate are expected to speak at Tuesday's ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda.

The event comes against the backdrop of a bitter battle over who bears blame for the hasty and deadly evacuation from Kabul. Johnson scheduled the ceremony just hours before the first debate between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump.

Republicans in the House of Representatives also a damning investigation released Sunday about the withdrawal, blaming Biden's administration and downplaying the role of Trump, who signed the withdrawal deal with the Taliban.

Johnson, a Louisiana Republican and a Trump ally, praised the House report, which was led by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul.

""We cannot allow the Biden-Harris administration to rewrite history,"" Johnson said in a statement. ""The families of the 13 fallen service members and the allies we failed in Afghanistan deserve better.""

White House national security spokesman John Kirby criticized the House report Monday as biased and one-sided, saying it revealed little new information and contained several inaccuracies. He noted that evacuation plans had been underway long before the withdrawal and that the U.S. had not transferred any equipment to the Taliban. He said the fall of Kabul ""happened much more quickly than anyone could have anticipated.""

He also acknowledged that during the evacuation, ""not everything went according to plan. Nothing ever goes according to plan.""

""We all hold ourselves responsible for that situation,"" he said of the deaths.

Kirby added that ""quite a few"" people from the Department of Defense would be at Tuesday's ceremony.

The top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, also issued a memo in response to the GOP report, saying he was concerned about ""attempts to politicize the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.""

""The partisan efforts by Republicans to grab headlines instead of acknowledging the full facts and substance of their investigation have only intensified in the heat of the election season,"" Meeks said.

Pentagon reviews are complete that the suicide attack could not have been prevented and that claims that troops had seen the potential terrorist were untrue.

Anyway, Trump has push the withdrawalwith the support of some of the families of the Americans killed, at the center of his campaign. Last month, his political team distributed videos of him attending a wreath laying ceremony for the fallen soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery on the third anniversary of the bombing, despite the ban on cemeteries about partisan activities on the grounds and an altercation with a cemetery employee who wanted to ensure that the campaign complied with the rules.

The Military Families with a Gold Star Those who invited him to the Arlington ceremony have defended Trump's actions. At a fiery news conference outside the Capitol on Monday, they pleaded for the House report to be taken seriously and demanded accountability for leaders during the evacuation from Kabul.

""President Trump is certainly not perfect. But he is, to me, a much better choice than the mess that Biden and Harris have created since Kabul,"" said Paula Knauss Selph, whose son Ryan Knauss was killed in the Abbey Gate attack.

Although Trump and Republicans have tried to link Harris to the withdrawal as a campaign issue, and Harris has said she was the last person in the room when Biden made his decision, neither the oversight reviews nor the 18-month investigation by House Republicans have found any instances where the vice president had a significant impact on decision-making.

Still, House Republicans argued that Harris, as well as Biden's national security team, should be held accountable for the consequences of the deadly withdrawal.

""Kamala Harris is running for president of the United States. She is running for commander in chief. She needs to answer to this report immediately,"" said Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican on the committee.

McCaul, the chairman, also defended the timing of the report, saying the committee's investigation had to overcome resistance from the Biden administration.

He presented the investigation as a ""mission to get to the truth"" rather than a partisan endeavor, but also boasted that of all the investigations House Republicans have launched into the Biden administration in the past two years, ""this is the one they fear the most.""

Most assessments have concluded that Trump and Biden share blame for the disastrous end to America's longest war, which saw hostile Taliban retake control of Afghanistan before the last U.S. troops had even left Kabul airport. The top U.S. government watchdog on the war points to Trump's 2020 deal with the Taliban to withdraw all U.S. troops and military contractors as ""the single most important factor"" in the collapse of U.S.-allied Afghan security forces and the Taliban takeover.

Biden's announcement in April 2021 that he would continue the withdrawal initiated by Trump was the second-biggest factor, the watchdog said.

Both Trump and Biden continued to phase in U.S. troop withdrawals. In Trump's case, major U.S. airstrikes against the Taliban were drastically scaled back. This despite the fact that the Taliban has not entered into substantive negotiations with the U.S.-backed civilian government, as required by Trump's withdrawal agreement.

86,"Washington: Mass expulsions? Political revenge? World peace? A new golden age? As Donald Trump vies for another term in the White House, the country is abuzz with speculation over how life might look with the ex-president back at the helm.

Here are Trump's plans for the United States and the world, in five emblematic measures:

Mass deportations

Vice President Kamala Harris's rival in November's election has pledged to launch the biggest deportation operation of illegal migrants in US history on his first day in office.

""We're going to get them out as fast as we can,"" he has said, accusing undocumented migrants of ""poisoning the blood of our country.""

The 78-year-old, known for his unfinished US-Mexico border wall project, has said he would be happy to ""use the military"" as part of the effort and would open detention camps to process targets for expulsion.

""On day one of my new term in office, I will sign an executive order making clear to federal agencies that under the correct interpretation of the law, going forward the future children of illegal aliens will not receive automatic US citizenship,"" he said in a campaign video.

He has confirmed he also plans to reinstate his ban on entries from several Muslim-majority countries, as a means of ""keeping terrorists the hell out of our country.""

'Drill, baby, drill!'

Trump slammed the door on the 2015 Paris climate accords during his first term, and his campaign has said he intends to end US participation again if reelected.

He told supporters at a rally earlier in the summer that he would ""stop Biden's wasteful spending and rapidly terminate the green new scam"" - a reference to the funding committed by his successor to mitigating climate change.

""I will repeal crooked Joe Biden's insane electric vehicle mandate and we will 'drill, baby, drill,'"" Trump said in Wisconsin, using an old Republican slogan.

""Energy costs will come down very quickly,"" he vowed. ""In many cases we'll be cutting your energy costs in half.""

Crypto-a-go-go

Trump has pledged to make the United States the ""Bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world,"" and to put tech billionaire and right-wing conspiracy theorist Elon Musk in charge of a wide-ranging audit of governmental waste.

Trump also envisages tariffs of ""more than 10 percent"" on all imports. US companies - and eventually their customers - pay for import tariffs, not the companies exporting the goods.

He insists that the revenue collected will finance a ""middle class, upper class, lower class, business class big tax cut.""

Having waged a fierce trade war with China during his first term, he also plans to revoke the Asian giant's ""most favored nation"" status, granted to promote trade.

Abortion ambiguity

Trump never misses an opportunity to point out that it is partly thanks to him - and his three conservative Supreme Court appointments - that abortion rights have been considerably weakened in the United States.

But he is more ambiguous about the future of access to reproductive health care.

Insisting it should be an issue for the individual states, the Republican has balked at pushing a nationwide abortion ban, a commitment that would win him support from the religious right.

""You must follow your heart on this issue but remember, you must also win elections,"" he has said.

And he promised: ""My Administration will be great for women and their reproductive rights.""

Ukraine war 'plan'

Trump has been saying for months he could end the war in Ukraine within ""24 hours,"" without explaining how.

Critics suggest his plan would involve pressuring Kyiv to cede territory illegally occupied by Russia in both 2014 and 2022.

""I have a very exacting plan how to stop Ukraine and Russia, And I have a certain idea - maybe not a plan, but an idea - for China,"" he said in an interview.

""But I can't give you those plans, because if I give you those plans, I'm not going to be able to use them, they'll be very unsuccessful. You know, part of it's surprise, right?""

Trump presented himself as an unconditional defender of Israel when the war with Hamas broke out. But he has since appeared more critical in his comments about the US ally's military offensive in Gaza, saying: ""I'm not sure that I'm loving the way they're doing it.""

87,"By ISABELLA VOLMERT and GARY D. ROBERTSON - Associated Press

LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- The highest courts in two states ruled differently Monday on efforts by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to be removed from their presidential ballots, with a divided North Carolina Supreme Court affirming he should be omitted and the Michigan Supreme Court reversing a lower court decision and keeping him on.

Kennedy suspended his campaign more than two weeks ago and endorsed Republican nominee Donald Trump. The environmentalist and author has tried to get his name removed from ballots in several battleground states where the race between Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris are expected to be close.

In Michigan, Kennedy sued Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, on Aug. 30 in an attempt to remove his name from the ballot so as not to siphon votes away from Trump, who won Michigan by about 10,000 votes in 2016. Monday's decision reverses an intermediate-level Court of Appeals ruling made Friday. It ensures that Kennedy's name will appear on voters' ballots in Michigan despite his withdrawal from the race.

The Michigan Supreme Court said in a brief order that Kennedy ""has not shown an entitlement to this extraordinary relief.""

In North Carolina, the state Supreme Court ruled 4-3 to deny efforts by the State Board of Elections to have the justices consider overturning a Court of Appeals decision on Friday directing that Kennedy be removed from ballots. The Court of Appeals order had reversed a trial judge's ruling the day before that upheld the State Board of Elections' decision to keep Kennedy and running mate Nicole Shanahan on the ballot.

The Democratic majority on the elections board had rejected the request by We The People party of North Carolina -- a recently certified party assembled to collect signatures for Kennedy's candidacy -- to withdraw Kennedy from the ballot. The board's majority said it was impractical given actions already completed to begin ballot distribution, including printing and coding tabulation machines. Kennedy sued the next day.

A state law had required the first absentee ballots to be mailed or transmitted to voters who have already asked for them no later than 60 days before the general election, or last Friday. If it had occurred on time, North Carolina would have been the first state in the nation to distribute ballots for the Nov. 5 elections.

The North Carolina Supreme Court ruling means elections officials will have to reprint ballots without Kennedy and reassemble absentee ballot packets. Over 136,000 absentee ballot requests had been made as of late last week. More than 2.9 million absentee and in-person ballots with Kennedy's name on them had already been printed, according to the state board. Counties must pay for reprinting costs.

Monday evening's order, backed by four of the court's five Republican justices, said it's clear Kennedy resigned as a candidate and that a vote for him would not count.

State attorneys for the board have said it could take two weeks to get reprinted ballots out the door -- threatening violation of a federal law requiring absentee ballots be sent to military and overseas voters already requesting them by Sept. 21.

""We acknowledge that expediting the process of printing new ballots will require considerable time and effort by our election officials and significant expense to the State,"" the order reads. ""But that is a price the North Carolina Constitution expects us to incur to protect voters' fundamental right to vote their conscience and have that vote count.""

The court's two Democratic justices -- Allison Riggs and Anita Earls -- and Republican Justice Richard Dietz each wrote separate dissents. Riggs said the ""whims"" of Kennedy ""have been elevated above the constitutional interests"" of voters who wanted to vote as soon as possible.

After Monday night's order, North Carolina board Executive Director Karen Brinson Bell told county election officials not to mail any ballots until a statewide date is set. A potential waiver of the Sept. 21 federal deadline may be necessary, she wrote by email.

On the Michigan Supreme Court, justices nominated by Democrats currently hold a 4-3 majority. That court's order was unsigned, and two Republican-nominated justices wrote a dissenting opinion.

""We can only hope that the Secretary's misguided action -- now sanctioned with the imprimatur of this Court -- will not have national implications,"" the dissenting justices wrote.

Kennedy was nominated for president by the Natural Law Party in Michigan. Benson, Michigan's secretary of state, had previously cited a state law saying candidates who are nominated and accept a minor party's nomination ""shall not be permitted to withdraw.""

Angela Benander, spokesperson for Benson's office, said the department is grateful for the high court's ""swift response.""

""Clerks can now move forward with the ballot printing process to ensure absentee ballots will be delivered to voters by the federal deadlines,"" Benander said in a statement.

In separate statements, Kennedy attorney Aaron Siri criticized the Michigan ruling but said the North Carolina decision ""will assure that nobody in North Carolina votes for a candidate who is no longer running in their state.""

88,"Washington -- Former President Donald Trump was supposed to face off against President Biden in their second, and possibly final, debate before the election. Then came the unexpected twist in July.

Mr. Biden announced on July 21 that he was suspending his campaign as he faced growing skepticism within his own party about his ability to handle the job for another term after his rambling debate performance against Trump in June.

The debate, hosted by ABC News at Philadelphia's National Constitution Center, is now a showdown between Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump, who both agreed to move forward with it after weeks of back-and-forth about the event's specifics.

Here's what to know:

The debate begins at 9 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, Sept. 10.

""World News Tonight"" anchor David Muir and ABC News Live ""Prime"" anchor Linsey Davis will moderate the debate.

The debate will be held at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia.

Pennsylvania is one of seven battleground states that could help determine the outcome of the election. According to the latest CBS News estimate, Harris and Trump are tied in the state, which has 19 electoral votes.

The last debate between Mr. Biden and Trump also took place in a battleground state, Georgia. The two met in Atlanta at CNN's studios on June 27.

The campaigns and the network were hashing out the final rules in the days leading up to the debate. The final sticking point was over the microphones.

Harris' campaign wanted both microphones unmuted for the entire event. Trump's team wanted a candidate's microphone to be muted when their opponent is speaking -- a rule the Biden campaign requested during the last debate. The Harris campaign ultimately relented.

""Vice President Harris, a former prosecutor, will be fundamentally disadvantaged by this format, which will serve to shield Donald Trump from direct exchanges with the Vice President. We suspect this is the primary reason for his campaign's insistence on muted microphones,"" Harris' campaign said in a letter to ABC News.

""Notwithstanding our concerns, we understand that Donald Trump is a risk to skip the debate altogether, as he has threatened to do previously, if we do not accede to his preferred format,"" the letter read. ""We do not want to jeopardize the debate. For this reason, we accepted the full set of rules proposed by ABC, including muted microphones.""

According to the Harris campaign, it was offered assurances as to how any crosstalk may be handled. The microphones may be unmuted if there is significant crosstalk between the candidates. A candidate who constantly interrupts their opponent will be warned by the moderator and their comments may be relayed to the audience. And, if the microphones don't pick up the exchanges, a group of reporters who will be in the room would report anything noteworthy.

ABC News said the microphones ""will be live only for the candidate whose turn it is to speak and muted when the time belongs to another candidate."" Harris and Trump will not be allowed to ask each other questions.

Last month while campaigning in Virginia, Trump said he would ""rather have it probably on, but the agreement was that it would be the same as it was last time.""

A coin flip determined where Trump and Harris will stand on stage and the order of closing statements. Trump won the coin toss and chose to give the last closing statement. Harris selected the lectern on the left of the stage, meaning viewers will see her on the right side of their screens.

Candidates will have two minutes each for their closing statements. There are no opening statements. They will have two minutes to answer moderators' questions, two minutes for rebuttals and an extra minute for follow-ups or clarifications.

Harris and Trump will not be allowed to bring prewritten notes on stage, but will have a pen, notepad and bottle of water at their lecterns.

Campaign staff cannot interact with candidates during the commercial breaks, and there will be no live audience.

Jason Miller, a senior adviser to Trump, said the campaign was ""thrilled"" that Harris' team, which is mostly carryovers from Mr. Biden's campaign, ""finally accepted the already agreed upon rules of the debate that they wrote in the first place.""

Any topic is on the table. The network has not revealed potential topics and isn't expected to.

ABC has allowed other networks to simulcast the debate. It will air on a number of broadcast and cable networks, including CBS. Check your local listings. CBS News prime-time coverage begins at 8 p.m. ET.

Viewers can also watch the debate on ABC News Live, Disney+ and Hulu. It will also stream on CBS News 24/7, CBSNews.com and Paramount+, with pre-debate coverage beginning on CBS News 24/7 at 5 p.m. ET.

The 90-minute debate will end at 10:30 p.m. ET and have two commercial breaks.

As of now, there is just one more debate scheduled before the election, and it's between the vice presidential nominees, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance.

CBS News is hosting the vice presidential debate, which is set for Oct. 1 in New York City. It will be moderated by ""CBS Evening News"" anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell and ""Face the Nation"" moderator and CBS News chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan.

There could still be one more debate between Harris and Trump. Trump had proposed two other debates in September in addition to the ABC News debate. Harris' campaign said she would agree to one more meeting sometime in October. The two have not settled on a potential rematch date."
89,"CHICAGO (CBS) -- Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris will go head to head in a presidential debate in Philadelphia on Tuesday night -- continuing a 64-year tradition in television that began at CBS Chicago's old studios.

On Sept. 26, 1960, Vice President Richard M. Nixon and U.S. Sen. John F. Kennedy (D-Massachusetts) met for the first ever televised presidential debate in Studio 1 at the old CBS Chicago broadcast center at 630 N. McClurg Ct.

Political campaigns were not new to television in 1960. In 1952, campaign aide Roy O. Disney -- older brother of Walt Disney -- created the ""I Like Ike"" campaign for Republican candidate Dwight D. Eisenhower just for television. That same year, the Democratic and Republican national conventions -- both at the International Amphitheatre in Chicago -- were televised.

That same year, Nixon -- amid a scandal over campaign contribution ethics -- admitted that he had accepted a gift of a cocker spaniel pully named Checkers. Four years later, Kennedy made remarks at the 1956 DNC -- again held at the International Amphitheatre in Chicago.

In 1960, Nixon and Kennedy each won nomination for the top of the Republican and Democratic tickets for president. While Kennedy was on an upswing -- telling Protestant ministers in Houston that he could serve both his country and his church as a Roman Catholic -- Nixon suffered an injury to his left knee in a limousine while campaigning in North Carolina and ended up in the hospital with septic arthritis.

Congress suspended the ""equal time"" rule for broadcasting, thus making it so 14 minor-party candidates running for president in 1960 did not need to be granted equal time. The Democrat Kennedy and the Republican Nixon would debate one-on-one, and millions would be watching.

Some anticipated the debate audience could top that figure -- and even make or break a candidate's chances in the election.

CBS was selected to handle the first debate at its relatively new Chicago headquarters at 630 N. McClurg Ct. The building had been completed in 1924 as a horse stable for the Chicago Riding Club, and a dozen years later became the Chicago Arena -- which offered skating to the public and also hosted figure skating competitions, amateur hockey league games, and the Ice Capades. In addition to its vast ice rink, the Chicago Arena featured a bowling alley, a grill, and a $50,000 Wurlitzer theater pipe organ that was played as accompaniment for the skating.

In 1954, CBS purchased the Chicago Arena building for $1.5 million. The theater organ was sold off, the ice rink was removed, and according to the pamphlet ""WBBM Radio Yesterday & Today,"" original building architect Andrew Rebori developed a new design for the building as a broadcast center.

The CBS Chicago broadcast center opened in 1956 -- replacing a scattered local operation with studios at the Garrick Theater at 64 W. Randolph St. and the State-Lake Theatre at 180 N. State St. -- the latter which, as it happens, is now and has long been the home of ABC 7. The McClurg Court broadcast center later also supplanted CBS offices at the Wrigley Building.

WBBM radio operations were housed on the upper floors, while TV studios for WBBM-TV, CBS Channel 2, were housed on the ground floor.

Four years after the building opened Studio 1 at Channel 2 -- the largest of four studios on the ground floor -- would be the site where Nixon and Kennedy would meet for the first televised presidential debate.

Frantic preparation got under way ahead of time. Producer Don Hewitt, who eight years later would go on to create ""60 Minutes,"" served as the field commander for CBS at the Chicago studios. For several days, CBS executives and representatives of both candidates discussed debate rules, camera positions, lighting, and the style of chairs.

A gray background was chosen for the black-and-white broadcast, but there were discussions and debates about the type of paint and the shade. Gallons of paint were hand-carried and the set was painted again and again. It was still sticky when the candidates arrived on the evening of Sept. 26.

The candidates were driven into the broadcast center in late-model sedans through a back door on Erie Street, and right down a long, broad hallway that led to Studio 1. As seen in an old diagram prepared by the U.S. Secret Service and the Chicago Police Department -- a replica of which CBS Chicago still has in its present building -- every position was set ahead of time in Studio 1.

The candidates were in front, facing moderator Howard K. Smith and the correspondents who would ask the candidates questions -- Sander Vanocur of NBC News, Charles Warren of Mutual News, Stuart Novins of CBS News, and Bob Fleming of ABC News.

The Nixon and Kennedy campaigns also each had their own office space behind Studio 1. While Studio 2 was set aside for the nightly 10 o'clock broadcasts on Channel 2, Studios 3 and 4 farther down the hall toward the back of the building were set aside for some 380 reporters who would watch the debate on closed-circuit television and type out reports in real time.

Nixon arrived first. His car came through the Erie Street rear entrance about an hour before airtime, at 7:30 p.m. He was met right away by CBS network brass -- including Chairman William S. Paley and President Frank Stanton.

Observers said Nixon seemed pale, and an aide said he had indeed turned sheet white after suffering his knee injury and infection. Nevertheless, he came across as confident and relaxed.

Meanwhile outside the broadcast center, dozens of Kennedy supporters only glimpsed at the back door as their candidate entered in a car through the Erie Street back door -- and met with the same dignitaries and executives Nixon had.

Many remarked on how good Kennedy looked -- with a tan brought about by campaigning in an open car in California. The 6-foot 1-inch Kennedy also wore a dark suit that fit better than Nixon's lighter gray suit that nearly matched the gray backdrop. Observers noted that Nixon had lost weight, and his clothes seemed baggy.

Before arriving, Nixon had met with a hostile labor union audience earlier in the day -- and had returned to the Congress Hotel in the South Loop a few minutes earlier, before going over the debate with an adviser on the way to CBS. Kennedy had made a brief campaign appearance before the same labor group, and had then spent time roleplaying the debate at the Ambassador East Hotel in the Gold Coast -- with his advisers firing questions on all manner of domestic issues.

Meanwhile, Nixon's aides were worried about how he'd look on camera -- with lost weight, pale skin, and stubble. The TV cameras made him look like he had a 5 o'clock shadow.

CBS offered a professional makeup artist for both candidates, but both declined such a service -- despite Nixon's staff pleading with him to let the makeup artist work on him. So Nixon staffers went over to a Magnificent Mile drugstore and picked up some Lazy Shave -- a product described in published reports as marketing itself as a ""color-cake for between shaves.""

Still, many thought Nixon looked haggard next to Kennedy.

The subjects addressed at the debate focused on domestic policy, as noted by the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. They included education, the economy, health care, labor, agriculture, and the Cold War, the library noted.

""I know what it means to be poor. I know what it means to see people who are unemployed. I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do,"" Nixon said to the cameras. ""But our disagreement is not about the goals for America, but only about the means to reach those goals.""

""I come out of the Democratic Party, which in this century has produced Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, and which supported and sustained these programs which I've discussed tonight,"" Kennedy told the cameras.

Nixon followed a more traditional debate style -- turning and facing away from the home audience and looking at Kennedy. When not speaking, observers noticed Nixon appeared to look nervously around the studio -- sometimes at CBS News President Sig Mickelson, who was serving as timekeeper. But Kennedy seemed to listen calmly and intently to Nixon when not talking, observers noted.

Meanwhile, Hewitt was in the control room directing the selection and timing of reaction shots from one candidate as the other spoke -- standard procedure in television, but to the disappointment of the Nixon campaign. Nixon's campaign felt the reaction shots were too close and tight, and very unflattering -- and also took issue with full-body shots that showed Nixon favoring his knee that had been injured.

Hot TV lights also had an effect. The 650-watt spotlights and studio lights caused Nixon to sweat profusely -- defeating the purpose of Lazy Shave that had been applied to hide his stubble.

The Kennedy campaign, for its part, was pleased with the way its candidate appeared in the reaction shots. Kennedy got 11 reaction shots totaling 118 seconds, while Nixon got nine shots and 85 seconds.

Hewitt later said he had been told simply to call the reaction shots as he saw then, and that was what he did. But those who watched on television were sure Kennedy had won, and some undecided and independent voters said they were convinced to cast their vote for Kennedy because of his debate performance.

Kennedy and Nixon debated three more times before the 1960 election -- in New York City; Washington, D.C.; and Los Angeles. Nixon came off better in the later debates -- particularly the last on foreign policy in New York on Oct. 21.

But Kennedy won the election.

Both Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson, in 1964, and Nixon again -- when he successfully ran again for president in 1968 and re-election in 1972 -- refused to debate their opponents. The next televised presidential debate didn't happen for 16 years, when incumbent President Gerald Ford and challenger Jimmy Carter debated in 1976. Vice presidential candidates Bob Dole and Walter Mondale also debated that year.

As to the historic Studio 1 at the old CBS Chicago Broadcast Center, it looked much the same when ""The Great Debate"" special aired 15 years after Kennedy and Nixon's visit. But it was put to other uses to great acclaim. Phil Donahue taped his ""Donahue"" talk show from Studio 1 before a live audience from 1982 through 1984. Chicago Tribune and Channel 2 News movie critic Gene Siskel and his Chicago Sun-Times rival, Roger Ebert, used the studio for ""Siskel & Ebert"" for many years too.

In 1973, the wall came down between Studio 3 and 4 at the broadcast center -- the two studios where those 380 reporters had been plugging away at their typewriters during the 1960 debate. Now double in size, this space became a massive working newsroom that was designed to double as an on-air set for the news.

The big newsroom with all its bustle was the on-air set for a famous era of Channel 2 News in the 1970s and 1980s -- with such household-name anchors as Walter Jacobson, Don Craig, Harry Porterfield, Lester Holt, Linda MacLennan, and of course, the very host of ""The Great Debate"" documentary, Bill Kurtis. Channel 2 went back to Studio 2 for its news set in the early 90s, but the big newsroom remained in use as the station's newsroom until we moved buildings.

And for the last several years, CBS 2 News -- as it was known by then -- was a little farther down the hall, back in the historic Studio 1 where Nixon and Kennedy had once debated before the country.

CBS Chicago moved to its current studios at 22 W. Washington St. in the fall of 2008. The old McClurg Court broadcast center was torn down, and the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab now occupies its footprint."
90,"LANSING, Michigan -- The highest courts in two states ruled differently Monday on the efforts of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to be removed from their presidential ballots, while the North Carolina Supreme Court ruled in a divided manner that he should be omitted and the Michigan Supreme Court reversed a lower court ruling and kept him in office.

Kennedy suspended his campaign more than two weeks ago and supported Republican candidate Donald Trump. The environmental activist and author has sought to have his name removed from ballots in several swing states where the race between Trump and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris is expected to be close.

In Michigan, Kennedy filed a lawsuit on August 30 against Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, seeking to have his name removed from the ballot to avoid stealing votes from Trump, who won Michigan by about 10,000 votes in 2016. Monday's decision reverses a ruling by an intermediate appeals court that had been made FridayIt ensures that Kennedy's name will appear on Michigan voters' ballots despite his withdrawal from the race.

The Michigan Supreme Court held in a brief order that Kennedy ""has not shown himself entitled to this extraordinary relief.""

In North Carolina, the Supreme Court voted 4-3 to reject an effort by the State Board of Elections to have the justices consider overturning the law. a ruling by the Court of Appeal on Friday who ordered that Kennedy be removed from the ballots. The appeals court had overturned a trial judge's ruling the day before, which had upheld the State Board of Elections' decision to keep Kennedy and running mate Nicole Shanahan on the ballot.

The Democratic majority on the electoral college had denied a request by North Carolina's We The People party -- a recently certified party that had come together to collect signatures for Kennedy's candidacy -- to remove Kennedy from the ballot. The board's majority said it was impractical given the actions already taken to begin distributing the ballots, including printing and encoding counting machines. Kennedy charged the next day.

A state law required that first-time mail ballots be mailed or sent to voters who had already requested them no later than 60 days before the general election, or by Friday. Had it been done in time, North Carolina would have been the first state in the country to distribute ballots for the Nov. 5 election.

The North Carolina Supreme Court's ruling means state and county election officials will have to reprint ballots without Kennedy and reconstitute more than 130,000 mail ballots for those who already requested them. More than 2.9 million mail ballots and in-person ballots with Kennedy's name on them had already been printed, the state board said. Counties will have to pay for the cost of reprinting.

Monday night's ruling, which was supported by four of the court's five Republican justices, said it was clear that Kennedy had withdrawn as a candidate and that a vote for him would not count.

State attorneys for the council have said it could take up to two weeks for the reprinted ballots to get out, threatening to violate a federal law that requires mail-in ballots to be sent by Sept. 21 to military personnel and voters abroad who have already requested them.

""We recognize that expediting the process of printing new ballots will require significant time and effort on the part of our election officials and significant expense to the state,"" the order reads. ""But that is a price the North Carolina Constitution requires us to pay to protect the fundamental right of voters to cast their own ballots and have their votes counted.""

The court's two Democratic justices -- Allison Riggs and Anita Earls -- and Republican Justice Richard Dietz each wrote their own dissent. Riggs said Kennedy's ""whims"" were ""above the constitutional interests"" of voters who wanted to cast ballots as soon as possible.

After Monday night's order, Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the North Carolina Board of Elections, told county election officials not to mail out ballots until a statewide date is set. A possible waiver of the Sept. 21 federal deadline may be necessary, she wrote in an email.

On the Michigan Supreme Court, justices nominated by Democrats currently hold a 4-3 majority. That court's order was unsigned, and two Republican-nominated justices wrote a dissenting opinion.

""We can only hope that the Minister's misguided action - now approved with the approval of this Court - will have no national implications,"" the dissenting judges wrote.

Kennedy was nominated for president by the Natural Law Party in Michigan. Benson, the Michigan secretary of state, had previously cited a state law that states that candidates who are nominated and accept the nomination of a minor party ""may not withdraw.""

Angela Benander, a spokesperson for Benson's office, said the department is grateful for the high court's ""quick response.""

""Clerks can now proceed with printing ballots to ensure mail-in ballots are delivered to voters before the federal deadline,"" Benander said in a statement.

91,"WASHINGTON - Mass expulsions? Political revenge? World peace? A new golden age? As Donald Trump vies for another term in the White House, the country is abuzz with speculation over how life might look with the ex-president back at the helm.

Here are Trump's plans for the United States and the world, in five emblematic measures.

- Mass deportations -

Vice President Kamala Harris's rival in November's election has pledged to launch the biggest deportation operation of illegal migrants in US history on his first day in office.

""We're going to get them out as fast as we can,"" he has said, accusing undocumented migrants of ""poisoning the blood of our country.""

The 78-year-old, known for his unfinished US-Mexico border wall project, has said he would be happy to ""use the military"" as part of the effort and would open detention camps to process targets for expulsion.

""On day one of my new term in office, I will sign an executive order making clear to federal agencies that under the correct interpretation of the law, going forward the future children of illegal aliens will not receive automatic US citizenship,"" he said in a campaign video.

He has confirmed he also plans to reinstate his ban on entries from several Muslim-majority countries, as a means of ""keeping terrorists the hell out of our country.""

- 'Drill, baby, drill!' -

Trump slammed the door on the 2015 Paris climate accords during his first term, and his campaign has said he intends to end US participation again if reelected.

He told supporters at a rally earlier in the summer that he would ""stop Biden's wasteful spending and rapidly terminate the green new scam"" -- a reference to the funding committed by his successor to mitigating climate change.

""I will repeal crooked Joe Biden's insane electric vehicle mandate and we will 'drill, baby, drill,'"" Trump said in Wisconsin, using an old Republican slogan.

""Energy costs will come down very quickly,"" he vowed. ""In many cases we'll be cutting your energy costs in half."""
92,"PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are set to face off in Philadelphia for their first presidential debate of the 2024 election on Tuesday night.

Action News was there as Harris' motorcade arrived in Center City on Monday, making its way down 17th Street near Rittenhouse Square.

Trump is expected to arrive Tuesday for the highly-anticipated debate at the National Constitution Center.

Ahead of the must-watch event, Action News talked about potential debate strategies with Villanova University Political Science Professor David Barrett.

READ | Harris-Trump ABC News presidential debate: How to watch, what to know

He believes Trump's approach should focus on tying Harris to the economy and the lingering issues along the southern border.

""If you can sort of marginalize her candidacy by issues-oriented attacks, then I think that can go well for him,"" Barrett explained.

The professor said if he were advising Harris, he would encourage her to remain positive, even if Trump launches personal attacks.

""Focus on what she sees as the strength of her candidacy and doing it in a way that sort of gives off optimism and the sense of joy and focus on the future,"" he says.

Harris said in an interview that aired Monday that she expects Trump to lie during the ABC News presidential debate.

While Harris' strategy has been focused on establishing her presence and redefining herself for voters, she now plans to prioritize attacking Trump's record and getting under his skin during the debate.

Meanwhile, the Trump campaign and surrogates continued to insinuate on Monday that the former president's strategy at the debate will be to tie Harris to what they say are her policy failures and ""disasters"" as a leader of the Biden-Harris administration.

Barrett told Action News that, historically, presidential debates have rarely done much to move the needle of public opinion.

SEE ALSO | Street closures, other changes in Philadelphia you need to know about for the presidential debate

Despite this, he says this debate might be one of the exceptions, especially if either candidate performs exceptionally poorly.

Action News asked people around Rittenhouse Square how they expected the debate to go.

""Harris will probably try to bring out the worst in Trump. There is a decent chance that he'll indulge her in that, but that does not seem to fundamentally move public opinion,"" said Adam Scales.

""I think there's a lot going on in the world right now. I think economically, politically, spiritually, people need directions so it'll be interesting to see,"" added Laura Rahauser."
93,"WASHINGTON -- Allies of Donald Trump see Tuesday's debate as a pivotal moment for the Republican presidential nominee -- a chance to shore up support and turn the corner from Kamala Harris' post-nomination ""honeymoon.""

""Failure would give people permission to leave,"" said a former adviser, adding that Trump must clear a bar set by his own performance against Hillary Clinton in the second presidential debate of 2016, when he was seen as taking her to task on policy issues and skipped the rage-infused language of his stump speech.

Fresher in people's minds, however, will be the previous debate, where Trump finished on a high note; not only did President Joe Biden's stumbling answers ultimately lead to his replacement, but Trump's own performance was also largely lauded by Republicans as disciplined.

The intervening weeks, however, have been a roller coaster. As Biden floundered, Republicans rallied around Trump at the party's convention in Milwaukee after a failed assassination attempt on July 13.

But things quickly shifted when Biden dropped his re-election bid. Harris' unexpected ability to quickly consolidate Democratic support, raising significant amounts of cash and generating new enthusiasm in the party, left many Republicans fretting.

Trump allies are hopeful that the debate will cap a turnaround from the recent weeks of tumult and help him enter the fall on a competitive footing.

""Everyone on Team Trump firmly believes that we're better-positioned to win,"" said a source close to Trump. ""Harris won't be able to convince working-class Americans that she is telling the truth about her policy reversals, and they're not going to roll the dice on her.""

Trump has a long track record of getting his supporters excited that he's finally dedicated to staying on message, or close to it, and talking policy, only to moments later veer completely off script and say something that triggers blowback. Even the most optimistic allies admit that always remains a risk, but they hope he can remain focused in the final weeks and stick to talking substance.

Harris poses a different set of challenges for Trump on the debate stage.

Harris, who has been participating in mock debates, going through lengthy question-and-answer sessions and reading pages of briefing books prepared by her staff, is hoping for a chance to needle Trump or provoke an outburst from him, two sources familiar with her preparations said.

Both campaigns are racing to define Harris, and Trump's advisers have said he'll be successful in the debate if he ties her record in the White House to Biden's. According to a source familiar with the preparations, Trump took part in an extensive debate prep session focused on policy at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida on Sunday, with additional sessions planned for Monday.

""In this debate, President Trump will tie Kamala Harris to her record: her record on the border, her record with global instability and her record being the deciding vote for high prices,"" Jason Miller, a senior adviser to Trump, said on a call with reporters Monday. ""And if President Trump ties Kamala Harris to her record, which we are very confident he'll do, that'll be a success.""

Ultimately, said Brandon Scholz, a former Wisconsin GOP chair, the national partisan divide will dominate, and it will still be up to that small percentage of undecideds in battleground states who could dictate the election. The results of the debate, however, could be persuasive to those people, he added.

""If he gets out of that debate and it's neutral and she doesn't take him down, that's the best scenario for him,"" Scholz said.

Trump isn't yet out of the woods; while a poll published over the weekend showed a tight race, Harris continues to draw in more campaign cash than Trump. An adviser said that if the election were held today, a Trump victory wouldn't be guaranteed.

Supporters of Trump say they have seen a shift in recent days -- he's scheduling more events and talking less about Harris' gender and race, and he isn't digging up old grievances aimed at fellow Republicans -- like going after Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. And on Friday, Trump scored a significant win as the judge in his criminal case in New York City delayed sentencing until after the November election.

""There's a bit of a reset happening, and you're going to see a Trump campaign that's more focused and kind of goes back to the future, to where he was this spring,"" said Trump donor Dan Eberhart, CEO of the energy company Canary.

The addition of more senior campaign staff members, including 2016 campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, has reassured some worried allies who are hopeful that Trump is now on a trajectory-smoothing path. His arrival has prompted some campaign staffers to rethink their approach, said a source close to the campaign.

""His presence alone is driving people to think twice about what they're doing,"" said the source, who said Trump's ""psyche"" appears to have improved.

A campaign official said that the team is being expanded at a crucial point in the race and that ""the more confident people on board, the better.""

Eberhart credited the fresh dynamics of the race with getting Trump to shift his focus and said outside pressures have yielded dividends before.

""Trump is better when he is behind -- more focused,"" he said. ""If you look at why he won in 2016, I think he was legitimately playing like he was behind. And that creates more discipline.""

Polls frequently show Trump scoring better marks on the economy -- even as he often strays from the message when his campaign pushes him to focus on it.

""They've really begun to focus on the economy. Of course, immigration, too,"" said Ed Broyhill, a North Carolina Republican National Committeeman and a fundraiser for Trump. ""I think they've gotten the message.""

Harris' replacing Biden on the ballot scrambled the strategy for Trump and his team -- leaving a period when it seemed to some that the message was off. Trump, himself, at times seemed reluctant to move on from his old adversary, still bringing Biden up at his events and lashing out over the switch on social media.

""What they're frustrated about is the fact that they have to do all the defining again after spending a $100 million-plus on Biden,"" GOP strategist Ford O'Connell said.

A Republican source in touch with the campaign who wasn't authorized to speak publicly recalled spending weeks twisting in knots, awaiting an end to the Harris ""honeymoon,"" as enthusiasm buoyed her. The Trump ally feared Trump's operation had grown comfortable as Biden collapsed in the polls.

""Donors have been very frustrated, [wondering] how are we going to win this thing,"" the source said.

Timing may be the trick to righting the ship, some Trump allies speculate.

""The Democrats and the Harris campaign have done an amazing job at messaging and hitting at the right time. The sun, moon and the stars all came together. But eventually, the sun, moon and the stars separated,"" Scholz said.

Initially, Trump's team appeared flatfooted in responding to Harris and failed to respond to the wave of energy that elevated her for weeks. But Scholz said he believes the enthusiasm gap has narrowed now, and he pointed to several ads attacking Harris, including on the border and on ""Bidenomics,"" which he said are helping cast doubt on her candidacy.

Former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., a Trump surrogate, said: ""If Trump is in the race, he is going to be a factor in everyone's decision. You can't ignore that. [But] as you see from the polls, on the issues that matter to most Americans, they favor his record over hers."""
94,"FILE - Former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell speaks during a gubernatorial forum in Philadelphia, Oct. 10, 2018.

HARRISBURG, Pa. -- When Donald Trump and Kamala Harris meet onstage Tuesday night in Philadelphia, they'll both know there's little debate that Pennsylvania is critical to their chances of winning the presidency.

The most populous presidential swing state has sided with the winner of the past two elections, each time by just tens of thousands of votes. Polling this year suggests Pennsylvania will be close once more in November.

A loss in the state will make it difficult to make up the electoral votes elsewhere to win the presidency. Trump and Harris have been frequent visitors in recent days -- Harris plans to return on Friday -- and the former president was speaking in Butler County on July 14 when he was the target of an assassination attempt.

The stakes may be especially high for Harris: No Democrat has won the White House without Pennsylvania since 1948.

Pennsylvanians broke a string of six Democratic victories in the state when they helped propel Trump to victory in 2016, then backed native son Joe Biden in the 2020 race against Trump.

""They say that 'If you win Pennsylvania, you're going to win the whole thing,'"" Trump told a crowd in Wilkes-Barre's Mohegan Arena in August.

Republicans are looking to blunt Trump's unpopularity in Pennsylvania's growing and increasingly liberal suburbs by criticizing the Biden administration's handling of the economy. They hope to counter the Democrats' massive advantage in early voting by encouraging their base to vote by mail.

Harris is looking to reassemble the coalition behind Biden's winning campaign, including college students, Black voters and women animated by protecting abortion rights.

Democrats also say it will be critical for Harris to win big in Philadelphia -- the state's largest city, where Black residents are the largest group by race -- and its suburbs, while paring Trump's large margins among white voters across wide swaths of rural and small-town Pennsylvania.

The debate is set for the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. The city is a Democratic stronghold where Trump in 2020 notoriously said "" bad things happen,"" one of his baseless broadsides suggesting that Democrats could only win Pennsylvania by cheating.

Biden flipped Pennsylvania in 2020 not just by winning big in Philadelphia, but by running up bigger margins in the heavily populated suburbs around Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. He also got a boost in northeastern Pennsylvania in the counties around Scranton, where he grew up.

Ed Rendell, a former two-term Democratic governor who was hugely popular in Philadelphia and its suburbs, says Harris can do better than Biden in the suburbs.

""There's plenty of votes to get, a Democrat can get a greater margin in those counties,"" Rendell said.

Lawrence Tabas, chair of Pennsylvania's Republican Party, said Trump can make gains there, too. The GOP's polling and outreach shows that the effect of inflation on the economy is a priority for those suburbanites, he said, and that the issue works in the party's favor.

""A lot of people are really now starting to say, 'Look, personalities aside, they are what they are, but we really need the American economy to become strong again,'"" Tabas said.

Rendell dismisses that claim. He said Trump is veering off script and saying bizarre things that will ensure he gets a smaller share of independents and Republicans in the suburbs than he did in 2020.

""He's gotten so weird that he'll lose a lot of votes,"" Rendell said.

Harris has championed various steps to fight inflation, including capping the cost of prescription drugs, helping families afford child care, lowering the cost of groceries and offering incentives to encourage home ownership.

Pennsylvania's relatively stagnant economy usually lags the national economy, but its unemployment rate in July was nearly a full percentage point lower. The state's private sector wage growth, however, has slightly lagged behind the nation's since Biden took office in 2021, according to federal data.

Meanwhile, Democrats are hoping the enthusiasm since Biden withdrew from the race and Harris stepped in will carry through Election Day in November.

For one, they hope she will do better with women and Black voters, as the first female presidential nominee of Black heritage. Rendell said he is more optimistic about Harris' chances to win Pennsylvania than he was with Biden in the race.

""I think we're the favorite now,"" Rendell said.

The debate takes place before voting starts -- in Pennsylvania and everywhere else.

A national Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey conducted in July showed that about 8 in 10 Democrats said they would be satisfied with Harris as the party's nominee compared with 4 in 10 Democrats in March saying they would be satisfied with Biden as the candidate.

There is some optimism among Pennsylvania Democrats even in Republican-leaning counties, including a number of whiter, less affluent counties near Pittsburgh and Scranton that once voted for Democrats consistently.

In Washington County, just outside Pittsburgh in the heart of the state's natural gas-producing region, Larry Maggi, a Democratic county commissioner, thinks she will outrun Biden there.

Maggi is seeing more lawn signs for Harris than he ever saw for Biden, as well as more volunteers, many of whom are young women concerned about protecting abortion rights.

""I've been doing this for 25 years and I'm seeing people I've never seen,"" Maggi said.

Democrats also hope there is a growing number of voters like Roy Robbins, a retired FBI agent and registered independent, who regrets voting for Trump in 2016. Robbins did so, he said, because he thought a businessperson could break congressional deadlock.

""He's a liar,"" Robbins said. ""I think he's totally devoid of any morals whatsoever. And you can quote me: I think he's a despicable human being even though I voted for him.""

But Republicans have reason to be optimistic, too.

In the nation's No. 2 gas-producing state, even Democrats acknowledge that Harris' prior support for a fracking ban in her run for the 2020 nomination could prove costly. In this campaign, the vice president said the nation can achieve its clean energy goals without a ban, though Trump insists she will reverse course again.

Meanwhile, the Democratic advantage in the state's voter registration rolls has steadily shrunk since 2008, from 1.2 million to about 350,000 now.

Republicans credit their outreach to younger voters, as well as Black, Asian and Hispanic voters.

""A lot of them tell us it's the economy,"" Tabas said. ""And in Philly, it's also the crime and safety in the neighborhoods and communities.""

Those gains have yet to translate into GOP wins as Democrats have beaten Republicans by more than 2-to-1 in statewide contests the past decade.

Daniel Hopkins, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania, chalks up the narrowing registration gap, in part, to ""Reagan Democrats"" who have long voted for Republicans, but did not change their registration right away.

One of those voters is Larry Mitko, a longtime Democrat-turned-Republican who lives in a Pittsburgh suburb.

Mitko, 74, voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020, and was leaning toward voting for Trump in 2024 because of inflation and Biden's handling of the economy before Biden exited the race.

That is when Mitko became sure he would vote for Trump.

""I don't like the fact of how they lied to us telling us, 'He's OK, he's OK,' and he can't walk up the steps, he can't finish a sentence without forgetting what he's talking about,"" Mitko said of Biden.

Harris' late entry into the race could mean that many voters are still learning about her, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a University of Pennsylvania professor of communication who researches presidential debates.

More voters than usual may not be locked into a decision even as voting looms, Jamieson said, so this debate could make a difference."
95,"Washington: US Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump will take the stage this week for the only planned presidential debate ahead of the 2024 US election.

It will be the first time the two candidates have ever met in person, with the prime-time event expected to draw in tens of millions of viewers.

While Americans have a pretty good idea of who Trump is, this debate will be the first opportunity for many voters to assess Harris beyond the comfort of a scripted speech or her softball interview with CNN last week.

With less than two months before election day, the stakes could not be higher. Despite the shift in momentum since President Joe Biden withdrew his candidacy, polls suggest the race is tight, just as it was before Biden's own disastrous debate performance."
96,"WASHINGTON -- As Congress returned from a five-week recess Monday, House Republicans had attached a provision to bar noncitizens from voting in federal elections -- which is already unlawful -- to a stopgap funding bill that is already teeing up a battle with the Senate and White House.

The GOP drive in Congress echoes state lawmakers' push for ballot measures this November that would bar noncitizens from voting in Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wisconsin.

It also comes in the heat of the presidential campaign, as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump repeatedly calls for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants and faces the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, in a crucial Tuesday night debate.

Current federal government spending will expire Oct. 1, so Congress must pass a continuing resolution, or CR, to approve temporary spending beyond that date or risk a government shutdown.

The measure that requires proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections, which U.S. House Republicans and some vulnerable Democrats passed in July, has been added by the House GOP to a CR that would extend the budget until March 28. A vote by the House is expected this week.

The White House on Monday vowed President Joe Biden would issue a veto if Congress passed the measure in that form.

""Instead of meeting the security and disaster needs of the Nation, this bill includes unrelated cynical legislation that would do nothing to safeguard our elections, but would make it much harder for all eligible Americans to register to vote and increase the risk that eligible voters are purged from voter rolls,"" the White House said in a statement Monday. ""It is already illegal for noncitizens to vote in Federal elections -- it is a Federal crime punishable by prison and fines.""

The voting language is a nonstarter with Senate Democrats, who hold a slim majority in the chamber.

""As we have said repeatedly, avoiding a government shutdown requires bipartisanship, not a bill drawn up by one party,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Patty Murray of Washington said in a joint statement Friday.

""If Speaker Johnson drives House Republicans down this highly partisan path, the odds of a shutdown go way up, and Americans will know that the responsibility of a shutdown will be on the House Republicans' hands,"" they continued.

Democrats have argued that the bill is an attempt to sow distrust in U.S. elections ahead of November elections.

House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana has stressed that noncitizen voting in federal elections is an issue, although research has found it rarely happens.

""As the 2024 election nears, it is imperative that Congress does everything within our power to protect the integrity of our nation's election system,"" Johnson said in a statement.

The bill is also supported by Trump.

Johnson, while at Trump's residence in Palm Beach, Florida, in April, announced the House would pass a bill relating to noncitizen voting. The former president has often falsely blamed voting by large numbers of undocumented people for his 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton as the reason he lost the popular vote that year.

Other Democrats objected to passing a CR that would last until next year.

The top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, criticized the six-month measure because it is ""shortchanging veterans and jeopardizing their care by kicking the can down the road until March.""

""A continuing resolution to the end of March provides Republicans with more leverage to attempt to force their unpopular cuts to services that American families depend on to make ends meet,"" she said in a statement.

The original noncitizen voting bill, H.R.8281, was first introduced by Texas GOP Rep. Chip Roy, a member of the far-right House Freedom Caucus. It passed 221-198, with five Democrats voting with Republicans, but stalled in the Senate.

Those five Democrats who voted in support of the measure are: Reps. Jared Golden of Maine, Henry Cuellar of Texas, Donald Davis of North Carolina, Vicente Gonzalez of Texas and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington.

Under current U.S. law, only citizens can vote in federal elections, but the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 prohibits states from confirming citizenship status.

Along with the ballot measures, hundreds of Republican state legislators have also signed on to a letter by the Only Citizens Vote Coalition urging Congress to pass a bill to bar noncitizens from voting in federal elections.

The Only Citizens Vote Coalition includes election denier activists, organizations headed by former Trump aides and anti-immigrant groups. It was founded by Cleta Mitchell, a key figure who tried to overturn the 2020 presidential election and is now running a grassroots organization to aggressively monitor elections in November.

Five of the eight states -- Idaho, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wisconsin -- with votes set on ballot measures have state legislators who sponsored bills to put the question on the ballot and are signed on to the letter by Only Citizens Vote."
97,"BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (KGET) -- The first -- perhaps only -- debate between presidential nominees Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is Tuesday night, less than two months from election day.

Whether they're set on a candidate or not, most voters 17 News spoke with Monday are sure on what they want to see and don't want to see from the Harris-Trump faceoff.

""They should be respectful because last presidential debate, it was like a bunch of old people fighting,"" said Tacoma Turner, a young voter who leans independent to Republican.

Independent Ashlee Patton-McKay said, ""[Candidates should] hash out their issues and if anybody has questions, might as well ask them.""

Michelle Ortega, a Democrat, said, ""I would like them to actually discuss the main issues that we have today ... right now all we're seeing them is this back-and-forth battle.""

When it comes to Kern voters and their pick for president, it's a mixed bag.

You have those like Ortega who are dead set on Democrat Kamala Harris.

""She represents a lot of us, mostly Hispanics,"" she said.

You have those that lean towards Republican Donald Trump.

""I'd vote for Trump, but if Kamala Harris offered me something then [I'd switch],"" said Ethan Reynoso, who's not yet registered to vote.

And you have those that may not vote.

""And then if I like their personality, I look up their point of views,"" said Ashlee Patton-McKay. ""And if they don't agree with my point of views, how I feel, then I look at the other candidate. If none of them, I don't vote.""

These local voters noted issues like abortion, gas prices, the economy and even COVID-19 matter and should be discussed during the debate.

""Just appealing to the everyday person,"" said Tacoma Turner, when asked when the candidates need to do.

But retired Centennial High School debate coach Craig Austin said the night isn't exactly a debate.

According to rules both parties agreed to -- mics will be on only when each candidate has the floor.

""The debaters, so to speak, don't actually have to specifically address each other,"" Austin said.

But he underscored the stakes are still high, especially with Democrats still reeling from President Biden's June debate with Trump.

""It really made a difference,"" Austin began. ""[Biden is] no longer in the race.""

Austin also said Harris and Trump can appeal to the undecided voters, especially in swing states.

""Honestly, answer the question that the moderator gives,"" Austin said of his hopes. Personal attacks, he said, can be ""cringeworthy"" and unappealing to voters like himself, the former coach also noted.

And for viewers, the purpose of the night is to get informed about the presidential hopefuls.

""What do they want to do, and how they hope to achieve that,"" Austin responded when asked how viewers should interpret the debate.

He also added that the candidates must present his/herself as ""presidential."""
98,"ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - The last time Donald Trump was in a presidential debate, a sitting U.S. president was forced by his own party to drop out of the race.

On Tuesday, Trump will again take the debate stage with an entirely different challenger than the one he faced in Atlanta back in June, when Vice President Kamala Harris and the 45th president of the United States meet in a nationally televised debate in Philadelphia.

Tuesday's presidential debate is Trump's seventh such event, while Harris has participated in one national presidential debate during her failed 2020 Democratic primary bid, and one vice presidential debate against then-Vice President Mike Pence, also in 2020.

Harris won last month's Democrat nomination for president after incumbent Joe Biden ended his reelection bid which came in the wake of his disastrous CNN debate against Trump.

After the debate, political leaders on Wednesday are set to commemorate the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.

Georgia is remaining a key focus of both campaigns in the debate's aftermath. Over the weekend, the Harris campaign announced Gwen Walz, wife of vice presidential candidate Tim Walz, will be in Georgia as part of the campaign's ""New Way Forward Tour."" Details surrounding the venue and time have not yet been announced.

On Sept. 16, Trump's running mate, Ohio U.S. Sen. JD Vance, is among the featured speakers at the Georgia Faith and Freedom Coalition's victory dinner at the Cobb Galleria Centre.

Walz and Vance have agreed to an Oct. 1 debate hosted by CBS News in New York City.

In 2020, Biden became the first Democrat since Bill Clinton in 1992 to carry Georgia or any deep Southern state in a general presidential election. After the debate, Harris is set to travel to North Carolina as part of her campaign tour.

The first mail ballots in the Nov. 5, 2024, election last week went out to voters in North Carolina. Voter registration deadlines vary by state, with most falling between eight and 30 days before the election, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

The deadline is Oct. 7 in Georgia, one of this year's most prominent presidential battlegrounds.

Kemp - with whom Trump has had a high-profile, long-running feud which now appears to be cooling - is also headlining next Monday's event. Other featured speakers are U.S. Sen. Katie Britt (R-Alabama) and former U.S. congressional representative Tulsi Gabbard, who represented Hawaii for four terms as a Democrat but who left the party after an unsuccessful 2020 White House run.

Georgia U.S. Reps. Mike Collins and Barry Loudermilk are also appearing, along with Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, rumored to be a candidate for governor in less than two years.

Notably, Georgia Lt. Gov. Burt Jones and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger are not listed as featured speakers for the event. Both men are also frequently mentioned as 2026 gubernatorial candidates."
99,"WASHINGTON: US election administrators and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris' campaign condemned on Monday threats by Donald Trump to jail ""corrupt"" election officials if he wins on Nov 5, accusing him of intimidation and inciting potential violence.

They were responding to a social media post by the Republican presidential candidate on Saturday in which he threatened a range of people with prosecution if they were to engage in voter fraud in the 2024 election. Studies have found voter fraud in the US to be extremely rare.

Trump wrote: ""We cannot let our Country further devolve into a Third World Nation, AND WE WON'T! Please beware that this legal exposure extends to Lawyers, Political Operatives, Donors, Illegal Voters, & Corrupt Election Officials. Those involved in unscrupulous behavior will be sought out, caught, and prosecuted at levels, unfortunately, never seen before in our Country.""

Trump also repeated his baseless claim that his 2020 election defeat to Democratic President Joe Biden was due to fraud, the same message he gave to supporters before the deadly storming of the US Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021.

Adrian Fontes, a Democrat and the secretary of state in the battleground state of Arizona, described Trump's post on his Truth Social account as ""tyrannical"" and said it had the potential to incite political violence.

""Sadly, security is now one of the main considerations in election administration,"" Fontes, the top election official in Arizona, told Reuters. ""Trump's comments give the potential for bad actors to take them as a call to arms. We need to protect our election officials and our poll workers. We need to be prepared for just about anything.""

A Republican county clerk from Michigan, who declined to be named, objected to Trump's comments and said he did not want to further elevate Trump's post by remarking on it. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Amman Moussa, a Harris spokesperson, called Trump's comments ""extreme and unhinged,"" adding: ""Donald Trump is further ratcheting up his dangerous threats of revenge and retribution.""

Trump and Harris are locked in an election battle that opinion polls show is too close to call. Harris has wiped out the lead Trump enjoyed over Biden before the Democratic president dropped his reelection bid in July, and Harris became the party's White House nominee.

Since his 2020 defeat, Trump has regularly made false claims about election workers cheating him out of victory. Many have received threats.

In reaction to Trump's Saturday post, Jocelyn Benson, Michigan's Secretary of State and a Democrat, posted on X: ""My duty - and that of every election official in this nation - is to rise above the noise and continue to ensure our elections are fair, secure, accessible, and that the results are accurate. No amount of lies, delusions or threats will distract us from that purpose."""
100,"WASHINGTON, DC - When you are a vapid airhead with absolutely no core beliefs, or at least core beliefs that only the most radical leftists support, you need to gaslight the American people into believing you are not an unhinged extremist to appeal to ""moderates."" Such is the conundrum facing Kamala Harris, who has attempted to ""pivot"" way right to the point where she is mirroring policies advocated by her opponent, Donald Trump. And even left-leaning media outlets are starting to notice.

Last week, even CNN weighed in to highlight Harris' hypocrisy when it comes to issues that belong to Trump.

On the CNN program ""Erin Burnett OutFront, Burnett was interviewing CNN's K-File senior editor Andrew Kaczynski about Harris' latest flip-flop, where she is now claiming to support the border wall she has consistently railed about for years.

Kaczynski found some 50 instances where Harris slammed Trump's border wall but now claims she supports the wall as featured in campaign ads. Kaczynski said Harris's history of opposing the border wall is returning to ""haunt"" her.

After a Harris ad played featuring a portion of the wall, Burnett reminded viewers that Harris criticized the wall in her 2019 book, ""The Truths We Hold,"" which clearly were ""truths"" in 2019 that no longer hold now that she's running for president in a country overrun by illegal aliens whom the Biden-Harris administration allowed into the country.

In that book, Harris wrote that the wall was not only ""useless"" but would serve as a ""monument standing in opposition to not just everything I value, but to the fundamental values upon which this country was built."" Harris also complained that the wall was a symbol that runs counter to American values and tells the world to ""KEEP OUT.""

Harris further criticized the wall as a ""misuse of taxpayer money."" In a public event in 2019, Harris slammed Trump, calling the wall a ""vanity project"" while claiming Trump ""contrived a national crisis around his big distraction.""

Now, Harris is claiming she supports the wall. So much for her ""values.""

Kaczynski told Burnett the portion of the wall featured in the Harris ad was built during the Trump administration.

""That is a portion of wall that was actually built by Donald Trump. It was built in an area where there was not previous[ly] a border wall, it was actually pretty controversial when they were building it at the time,"" he said.

Other adjectives Harris used were ""unnecessary"" and ""wasteful.""

Burnett asked Kaczynski, ""She's using this wall that he built to say, 'Look what I did'?""

Harris was appointed as ""border czar"" by Biden in 2021 and, as such, has overseen an invasion of an estimated eight to ten million illegal aliens, not including so-called ""got-aways."" Included in those numbers are individuals on terror watch lists. With unlawful ""immigration"" being a key issue in the upcoming election, Harris is now trying to paint herself as a ""border hawk,"" which flies in the face of reality.

Kaczynski also pointed out to Burnett that other images of the wall in the Harris ad have ""telltale signs"" of being constructed during President Trump's term because they feature ""anti-climbing plates"" on top that were a feature on walls built during the Trump era.

Harris has criticized Trump and so-called ""MAGA Republicans"" for killing a ""bipartisan"" border bill that was rife with holes, as detailed by conservative talk show host Mark Levin during his Aug. 28, 2024 broadcast.

The bill would have allowed a minimum of 5,000 illegals per day to enter the country before the president ""could"" halt any further entry. It would have codified a provision to provide a pathway to citizenship for illegals, would have codified a provision to provide taxpayer-funded lawyers to fight deportations, and given work permits to illegal aliens enshrined into federal law.

The bill would also codify ""catch-and-release"" into law and provide billions in taxpayer dollars to sanctuary cities and NGOs to support illegal aliens. None of this includes the cost of providing Medicare and/or Medicaid to illegals. The bill has much more to hate, so the House refused to take it up. The bill was garbage. To hear Levin's description, you can listen here.

Harris raised that bill during the Democratic National Convention and vowed to sign the bill into law while at the same time pushing a pathway to citizenship for so-called ""DREAMers.""

Don't be fooled. Harris has not changed her position. She has overseen an unprecedented invasion at our southern border and there are nothing except empty words to suggest otherwise.
