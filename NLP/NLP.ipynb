    "text = \"Kamala Harris' campaign team is reportedly vetting retired Admiral William McRaven, who oversaw the May 2011 Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden, as a potential 2024 running mate for Vice President Kamala Harris. Other potential candidates include Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear. McRaven was commander of the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command between 2008 and 2011, and served as head of the United States Special Ops Command from August 2011 to 2014. He also served as Chancellor of the University of Texas System for over three years. As of Thursday morning, bookmaker William Hill had Senator Kelly as the firm favorite to be the Democrat's 2024 vice-presidential candidate with odds of 42.1 percent and 28.6 percent. Vice President Kamala Harris' list of potential running mates has narrowed to include one U.S. senator and several prominent Democratic governors. The Wall Street Journal reported that potential vice presidential candidates had been asked to provide vetting materials to the Harris campaign. This comes after President Joe Biden ended the presidential race and endorsed Harris. The Harris campaign has reportedly sought vetting materials from Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, Governor Roy Cooper of North Carolina, Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Governor J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, and Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota. However, Governor Andy Beshear of Kentucky has reportedly not been asked for vetting materials.\"\n",
