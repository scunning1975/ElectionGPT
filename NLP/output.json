                "title": "60 Years After Lyndon Johnson's \"Daisy Ad,\" the Silence on Nuclear War Is Dangerous",
                "body": "SAN FRANCISCO, USA, Sep 10 (IPS) - One evening in early September 1964, a frightening commercial jolted 50 million Americans who were partway through watching \"Monday Night at the Movies\" on NBC. The ad began with an adorable three-year-old girl counting petals as she pulled them from a daisy. Then came a man's somber voiceover, counting down from ten to zero. Then an ominous roar and a mushroom cloud from a nuclear bomb explosion.\n\nThe one-minute TV spot reached its climax with audio from President Lyndon Johnson, concluding that \"we must love each other, or we must die.\" The ad did not mention his opponent in the upcoming election, Sen. Barry Goldwater, but it didn't need to. By then, his cavalier attitude toward nuclear weapons was well established. Goldwater's bestseller The Conscience of a Conservative, published at the start of the decade, was unnervingly open to the idea of launching a nuclear war, while the book exuded disdain for leaders who \"would rather crawl on knees to Moscow than die under an Atom bomb.\" Closing in on the Republican nomination for president, the Arizona senator suggested that \"low-yield\" nuclear bombs could be useful to defoliate forests in Vietnam. His own words gave plenty of fodder to others seeking the GOP nomination. Pennsylvania Gov. William Scranton called Goldwater \"a trigger-happy dreamer\" and said that he \"too often casually prescribed nuclear war as a solution to a troubled world.\" New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller unloaded with a rhetorical question: \"How can there be sanity when he wants to give area commanders the authority to make decisions on the use of nuclear weapons?\" So, the stage was set for the \"daisy ad,\" which packed an emotional wallop -- and provoked a fierce backlash. Critics cried foul, deploring an attempt to use the specter of nuclear annihilation for political gain. Having accomplished the goal of putting the Goldwater camp on the defensive, the commercial never aired again as a paid ad. But national newscasts showed it while reporting on the controversy. Today, a campaign ad akin to the daisy spot is hard to imagine from the Democratic or Republican nominee to be commander in chief, who seem content to bypass the subject of nuclear-war dangers.\n\nYet those dangers are actually much higher now than they were 60 years ago. In 1964, the Doomsday Clock maintained by experts at the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists was set at 12 minutes to apocalyptic midnight. The ominous hands are now just 90 seconds away. Yet, in their convention speeches this summer, both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris were silent on the need to engage in genuine diplomacy for nuclear arms control, let alone take steps toward disarmament. Trump offered standard warnings about Russian and Chinese arsenals and Iran's nuclear program, and boasted of his rapport with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. Left unmentioned was Trump's presidential statement in 2017 that if North Korea made \"any more threats to the United States,\" that country \"will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.\" Nor did he refer to his highly irresponsible tweet that Kim should be informed \"I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!\" When Harris delivered her acceptance speech, it did not include the words \"atomic\" or \"nuclear\" at all. Now in high gear, the 2024 presidential campaign is completely lacking in the kind of wisdom about nuclear weapons and relations between the nuclear superpowers that Lyndon Johnson and, eventually, Ronald Reagan attained during their presidencies. Johnson privately acknowledged that the daisy commercial scared voters about Goldwater, which \"we goddamned set out to do.\" But the president was engaged in more than an electoral tactic. At the same time that he methodically deceived the American people while escalating the horrific war on Vietnam, Johnson pursued efforts to defuse the nuclear time bomb. \"We have made further progress in an effort to improve our understanding of each other's thinking on a number of questions,\" Johnson said at the conclusion of his extensive summit meeting with Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin in Glassboro, New Jersey, on June 25, 1967.\n\nBut fifty-seven years later, there is scant evidence that the current or next president of the United States is genuinely interested in improving such understanding between leaders of the biggest nuclear states. Two decades after the summit that defrosted the cold war and gave rise to what was dubbed \"the spirit of Glassboro,\" President Reagan stood next to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and said: \"We decided to talk to each other instead of about each other.\" But such an attitude would be heresy in the 2024 presidential campaign. \"These are the stakes,\" Johnson said in the daisy ad as a mushroom cloud rose on screen, \"to make a world in which all God's children can live, or to go into the dark.\" Those are still the stakes. But you wouldn't know it now from either of the candidates vying to be the next president of the United States.

                "title": "Harris-Trump debate becomes the 2024 election's latest landmark event",
                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will meet for the first time face-to-face Tuesday night for perhaps their only debate, a high-pressure opportunity to showcase their starkly different visions for the country after a tumultuous campaign summer.\n\nThe event, at 9 p.m. Eastern in Philadelphia, will offer Americans their most detailed look at a campaign that's dramatically changed since the last debate in June. In rapid fashion, President Joe Biden bowed out of the race after his disastrous performance, Trump survived an assassination attempt and bothsides chose their running mates.\n\nHarris is intent on demonstrating that she can press the Democratic case against Trump better than Biden did. Trump, in turn, is trying to paint the vice president as an out-of-touch liberal while trying to win over voters skeptical he should return to the White House.\n\nTrump, 78, has struggled to adapt to Harris, 59, who is the first woman, Black person and person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president. The Republican former president has at times resorted to invoking racial and gender stereotypes, frustrating allies who want Trump to focus instead on policy differences with Harris.\n\nThe vice president, for her part, will try to claim a share of credit for the Biden administration's accomplishments while also addressing its low moments and explaining her shifts away from more liberal positions she took in the past.\n\nThe debate will subject Harris, who has sat for only a single formal interview in the past six weeks, to a rare moment of sustained questioning.\n\n\"If she performs great, it's going to be a nice surprise for the Democrats and they'll rejoice,\" said Ari Fleischer, a Republican communications strategist and former press secretary to President George W. Bush. \"If she flops, like Joe Biden did, it could break this race wide open. So there's more riding on it.\"\n\nTim Hogan, who led Sen. Amy Klobuchar's debate preparations in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, said Harris, a former California attorney general, would bring a \"prosecutor's instincts to the debate stage.\"\n\n\"That is a very strong quality in that setting: having someone who knows how to land a punch and how to translate it,\" Hogan said.\n\nThe first early ballots of the presidential race will go out just hours after the debate, hosted by ABC News. Absentee ballots are set to be sent out beginning Wednesday in Alabama.\n\nTrump and his campaign have spotlighted far-left positions she took during her failed 2020 presidential bid. He's been assisted in his informal debate prep sessions by Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate who tore into Harris during their primary debates.\n\nHarris has sought to defend her shifts away from liberal causes to more moderate stances on fracking, expanding Medicare for all and mandatory gun buyback programs -- and even backing away from her position that plastic straws should be banned -- as pragmatism, insisting that her \"values remain the same.\" Her campaign on Monday published a page on its website listing her positions on key issues.\n\nThe former president has argued a Harris presidency is a threat to the safety of the country, highlighting that Biden tapped her to address the influx of migrants as the Republican once again makes dark warnings about immigration and those in the country illegally central to his campaign. He has sought to portray a Harris presidency as the continuation of Biden's still-unpopular administration, particularly his economic record, as voters still feel the bite of inflation even as it has cooled in recent months.\n\nTrump's team insist his tone won't be any different facing a female opponent.\n\n\"President Trump is going to be himself,\" senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters during a phone call Monday.\n\nGabbard, who was also on the call, added that Trump \"respects women and doesn't feel the need to be patronizing or to speak to women in any other way than he would speak to a man.\"\n\nHis advisers suggest Harris has a tendency to express herself in a \"word salad\" of meaningless phrases, prompting Trump to say last week that his debate strategy was to \"let her talk.\"\n\nThe former president frequently plows into rambling remarks that detour from his policy points. He regularly makes false claims about the last election, attacks a lengthy list of enemies and opponents working against him, offers praise for foreign strongmen and comments about race, like his false claim in July that Harris recently \"happened to turn Black.\"\n\nThe vice president, who has been the Biden administration's most outspoken supporter of abortion access after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, is expected to focus on calling out Trump's inconsistencies around women's reproductive care, including his announcement that he will vote to protect Florida's six-week abortion ban in a statewide referendum this fall.\n\nHarris was also set to try to portray herself as a steadier hand to lead the nation and safeguard its alliances, as war rages in Ukraine more than two years after Russia's invasion and Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza drags on with no end in sight.\n\nShe is likely to warn that Trump presents a threat to democracy, from his attempts in 2020 to overturn his loss in the presidential election, spurring his angry supporters to attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, through comments he made as recently as last weekend. Trump on social media issued yet another message of retribution, threatening that if he wins he will jail \"those involved in unscrupulous behavior,\" including lawyers, political operatives, donors, voters and election officials.\n\nHarris has spent the better part of the last five days ensconced in debate preparations in Pennsylvania, where she participated in hours-long mock sessions with a Trump stand-in. Ahead of the debate, she told radio host Rickey Smiley that she was workshopping how to respond if Trump lies.\n\n\"There's no floor for him in terms of how low he will go,\" she said.\n\n___\n\nAP Polling Editor Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux in Washington and Associated Press writers Thomas Beaumont in Las Vegas, Bill Barrow in Atlanta and Josh Boak in Pittsburgh contributed to this report.",

                "title": "How Harris' and Trump's tax and spending plans affect US debt By Reuters",
                "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican opponent Donald Trump have floated new tax breaks and spending plans, as they try to win votes by persuading Americans their ideas will do more to ease their financial burdens.\n\nBudget forecasters are struggling to keep up with the latest tweaks, and new ideas may be voiced in Tuesday's Harris-Trump debate, but so far all estimates show Trump's agenda piling up much more new federal debt.\n\nTrump has said he plans to extend all tax cuts he pushed through Congress in 2017, exempt Social Security and tip income from taxes, and further cut corporate income taxes.\n\nThese changes would likely add $3.6 trillion to $6.6 trillion to primary U.S. deficits over 10 years, according to published individual and comprehensive estimates from four budget forecasters reviewed by Reuters: the Penn-Wharton Budget Model, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), the Tax Foundation and Oxford Economics.\n\nHarris' plans, which include expanding the Child Tax Credit, a $6,000 bonus tax credit for newborns, a $25,000 first-time homebuyer tax credit, and no taxes on tips, could reduce deficits by as much as $400 billion or add up to $1.4 trillion to deficits over a decade, the same forecasters calculated.\n\nThe estimates are based on static budget scoring, and are compared against the Congressional Budget Office's current-law \"baseline,\" which already assumes a massive, $22 trillion increase in debt through 2034.\n\nROLLING ANALYSIS\n\nThe forecasts vary considerably depending on which ideas mentioned on the campaign trail are included.\n\nEstimates of Harris' recently rolled-out tax deduction of up to $50,000 for business startup costs, and a lower top capital gains tax than the one proposed by President Joe Biden are largely not included.\n\nThe forecasts include Trump's proposal to lower the corporate income tax to 15% from 21% but not his latest comments that this rate would be reserved only for companies that produce their goods in the U.S.\n\n\"The campaign talking points are moving faster than the budget models,\" said Shai Akabas, economic policy director for the Bipartisan Policy Center. \"I think we're largely seeing what we've come to expect in recent years, which is that candidates are going to put their popular policy priorities ahead of fiscal responsibility on both sides.\"\n\nCongress must approve tax and spending legislation, making it difficult for the winner of the Nov. 5 election to achieve their priorities without sweeping majorities in both the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n\n2025 TAX CLIFF\n\nThe major differentiator between Trump and Harris is how they address the 2025 expiration of individual tax cuts passed by Republicans during Trump's presidency in 2017. Without action by Congress, these rates would snap back to their previous, higher levels.\n\nTrump has pledged to permanently extend all of the expiring tax cuts, including for the wealthiest Americans, which tax and budget experts estimate would reduce revenues over a decade by about $3.3 trillion to $4 trillion.\n\nHarris would extend the 2017 tax cuts for only those earning under $400,000, keeping a Biden pledge, but this would add up to $2.5 trillion to a spending agenda already estimated at $2 trillion over a decade.\n\nHarris has quietly endorsed the nearly $5 trillion in tax hikes in Biden's fiscal 2025 budget request, including taxing unrealized gains from fortunes over $100 billion and raising the corporate tax rate to 28%\n\nThis has caused consternation on Wall Street but would substantially offset the cost of her spending plans.\n\n\"I think the conclusion that Trump's approach to taxes is more debt-fueled is correct,\" said Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. \"I say that because Harris at least has some pretty well-developed revenue raisers.\"\n\nTrump has not offered any conventional tax increases to offset his extended tax cuts. Other breaks, including exempting Social Security income, would reduce revenue by $1.6 trillion, CRFB and the Tax Foundation estimate.\n\nThe conservative-leaning Tax Foundation called the move \"unsound and fiscally irresponsible,\" weakening Social Security and Medicare.\n\nTrump has said his tax cuts would be paid for with \"trillions of dollars\" generated by stronger economic growth, new import tariffs, ending Biden's clean energy subsidies and a new government efficiency commission headed by billionaire entrepreneur and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk.\n\nThe Tax Policy Center has estimated that Trump's proposed 10% global tariff and 60% tariff on Chinese imports could raise up to $3.8 trillion over a decade but would reduce other revenues due to its economic effects, including imposing a de facto tax on households.\n\nThe Tax Foundation was the only model reviewed that included a tariff estimate as an offset -- $2.6 trillion -- but even then, it estimated that Trump's plans would boost deficits by nearly $4 trillion over a decade.",

                "title": "What to know ahead of Trump-Harris debate",
                "body": "PHILADELPHIA (TND) -- Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris will square off in a highly anticipated debate Tuesday night with the presidential campaign in full swing after nominating conventions and Election Day quickly nearing.\n\nIt will be the first and possibly only debate between two candidates locked into a race running on razor-thin margins with thousands of votes in around seven swing states likely to determine which one of them will end up in the Oval Office after Nov. 5.\n\nThe debate will start at 9 p.m. ET on ABC and last for 90 minutes.\n\nTrump and Harris are essentially locked into a dead heat in recent polling of national and swing state voters. Most polling finds either candidate winning by small margins that fall within the margin of error, indicating they are basically tied.\n\nA New York Times-Sienna College poll released over the weekend showed Trump leading Harris 48-47 among likely voters. Polling averages from the New York Times also show Harris is tied with Trump or holds small leads in the seven swing states that will decide the election, another indication it is anyone's race to win.\n\nHarris' campaign has framed itself as the underdog in the race, arguing Trump is effectively running as an incumbent even though she is currently the vice president. Trump has suggested his campaign will cruise to victory as long as the election has held fairly, a reference to his false claims of fraud from the 2020 election.\n\nPIVOTAL NIGHT FOR BOTH CANDIDATES\n\nWith the race so close and ballots being sent out to voters in some states in the coming weeks, both candidates are looking to make their mark in the race to gain an advantage heading into Election Day.\n\nSo far it is the only debate both candidates have agreed to, meaning that it may be the only time Harris and Trump appear on stage together. A vice presidential debate involving Republican JD Vance and Democrat Tim Walz is scheduled for Oct. 1.\n\nThe debate will offer each of them a sizable audience and their best chance to lay out their case to the American people, primarily undecided voters and independents. Both are expected to show stark contrasts between each other, with Trump framing Harris as an incompetent leader that has fueled the problems with inflation and crisis at the border, while Harris is likely to label the former president a threat to democracy and seek to blame him for the restriction of abortion rights in the wake of Roe v. Wade.\n\nMICS OFF\n\nHarris' campaign lost its adamant push to keep the microphones turned on while it is not a candidate's turn to speak, a continuation of a rule that President Joe Biden was adamant about implementing when he was still the Democratic nominee.\n\nHarris unsuccessfully tried to dare Trump into reversing the muted microphones from the first debate, a move aimed at getting him to get off script and highlight the differences between them.\n\nAnalysts said turning microphones off during the debate with Biden helped Trump, who did not get penalized for interrupting the president or moderators like he did during the 2020 cycle.\n\nTrump's campaign tried to frame the push for hot microphones as Harris trying to lay out an escape route of the debate, though she has remained committed to Tuesday night.\n\nRULES AND HOW TO WATCH\n\nABC will carry the debate live on television and have a stream available online. It will begin at 9 p.m. ET and run for 90 minutes with two commercial breaks.\n\nAnchors David Muir and Linsey Davis will moderate the debate and be the only ones asking questions. Candidates are not allowed to ask each other anything.\n\nThere will be no opening statements, each candidate will get two minutes to answer a question, two minutes to respond to the other and an additional minute for \"follow-ups, clarifications or responses.\"",

                "title": "How Harris' and Trump's tax and spending plans affect US debt",
                "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican opponent Donald Trump have floated new tax breaks and spending plans, as they try to win votes by persuading Americans their ideas will do more to ease their financial burdens.\n\nBudget forecasters are struggling to keep up with the latest tweaks, and new ideas may be voiced in Tuesday's Harris-Trump debate, but so far all estimates show Trump's agenda piling up much more new federal debt.\n\nTrump has said he plans to extend all tax cuts he pushed through Congress in 2017, exempt Social Security and tip income from taxes, and further cut corporate income taxes.\n\nThese changes would likely add $3.6 trillion to $6.6 trillion to primary U.S. deficits over 10 years, according to published individual and comprehensive estimates from four budget forecasters reviewed by Reuters: the Penn-Wharton Budget Model, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), the Tax Foundation and Oxford Economics.\n\nHarris' plans, which include expanding the Child Tax Credit, a $6,000 bonus tax credit for newborns, a $25,000 first-time homebuyer tax credit, and no taxes on tips, could reduce deficits by as much as $400 billion or add up to $1.4 trillion to deficits over a decade, the same forecasters calculated.\n\nThe estimates are based on static budget scoring, and are compared against the Congressional Budget Office's current-law \"baseline,\" which already assumes a massive, $22 trillion increase in debt through 2034.\n\nROLLING ANALYSIS\n\nThe forecasts vary considerably depending on which ideas mentioned on the campaign trail are included.\n\nEstimates of Harris' recently rolled-out tax deduction of up to $50,000 for business startup costs, and a lower top capital gains tax than the one proposed by President Joe Biden are largely not included.\n\nThe forecasts include Trump's proposal to lower the corporate income tax to 15% from 21% but not his latest comments that this rate would be reserved only for companies that produce their goods in the U.S.\n\n\"The campaign talking points are moving faster than the budget models,\" said Shai Akabas, economic policy director for the Bipartisan Policy Center. \"I think we're largely seeing what we've come to expect in recent years, which is that candidates are going to put their popular policy priorities ahead of fiscal responsibility on both sides.\"\n\nCongress must approve tax and spending legislation, making it difficult for the winner of the Nov. 5 election to achieve their priorities without sweeping majorities in both the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n\n2025 TAX CLIFF\n\nThe major differentiator between Trump and Harris is how they address the 2025 expiration of individual tax cuts passed by Republicans during Trump's presidency in 2017. Without action by Congress, these rates would snap back to their previous, higher levels.\n\nTrump has pledged to permanently extend all of the expiring tax cuts, including for the wealthiest Americans, which tax and budget experts estimate would reduce revenues over a decade by about $3.3 trillion to $4 trillion.\n\nHarris would extend the 2017 tax cuts for only those earning under $400,000, keeping a Biden pledge, but this would add up to $2.5 trillion to a spending agenda already estimated at $2 trillion over a decade.\n\nHarris has quietly endorsed the nearly $5 trillion in tax hikes in Biden's fiscal 2025 budget request, including taxing unrealized gains from fortunes over $100 billion and raising the corporate tax rate to 28%\n\nThis has caused consternation on Wall Street but would substantially offset the cost of her spending plans.\n\n\"I think the conclusion that Trump's approach to taxes is more debt-fueled is correct,\" said Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. \"I say that because Harris at least has some pretty well-developed revenue raisers.\"\n\nTrump has not offered any conventional tax increases to offset his extended tax cuts. Other breaks, including exempting Social Security income, would reduce revenue by $1.6 trillion, CRFB and the Tax Foundation estimate.\n\nThe conservative-leaning Tax Foundation called the move \"unsound and fiscally irresponsible,\" weakening Social Security and Medicare.\n\nTrump has said his tax cuts would be paid for with \"trillions of dollars\" generated by stronger economic growth, new import tariffs, ending Biden's clean energy subsidies and a new government efficiency commission headed by billionaire entrepreneur and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\n\nThe Tax Policy Center has estimated that Trump's proposed 10% global tariff and 60% tariff on Chinese imports could raise up to $3.8 trillion over a decade but would reduce other revenues due to its economic effects, including imposing a de facto tax on households.\n\nThe Tax Foundation was the only model reviewed that included a tariff estimate as an offset -- $2.6 trillion -- but even then, it estimated that Trump's plans would boost deficits by nearly $4 trillion over a decade.\n\n(Reporting by David Lawder; Editing by Heather Timmons and Jonathan Oatis)",

The first story we're talking about on Today in Ohio, the news podcast discussion from Cleveland .com and the Plain Dealer.\n\nhaving an adult conversation in Ohio about how to accommodate legal immigration. But no, no, JD Banks, Dave Joseph, Donald Trump, Bernie Moreno are turned into absolute nonsense and crowds out in the back. The first story we're talking about on Today in Ohio is a new podcast extension from Keeley .com and The Great Day. This week, we're going to some guys who are\n\nI'm Chris Quinn. I'm here with Lisa Garvin, Laura Johnston and Leila Tasi. And let's get to that story. How did JD Vance, Davios, John Husted and Donald Trump get it so wrong in widely publicizing a false claim about Haitian migrant crime like the killing of ducks in parks in Springfield, Ohio, Laura?\n\nMy guess is that they wanted to believe it, so they didn't check their facts. These claims circulated in right wing social media circles. Republicans in Ohio, around the country, are trying to make illegal immigration a cornerstone campaign in November, even though illegal immigration is not really a big problem in Ohio. But I guess if you can say, hey, Haitian immigrants, migrants, refugees are killing ducks in public parks, then we're going to try to make it an Ohio issue.\n\nBut the Springfield city manager is really trying to quell this and saying there have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals in the immigrant community. There are no verified instances of immigrants engaging in any illegal activities such as squatting or littering in front of residents' home. No reports on deliberately disrupting traffic. So apparently these are the rumors that have been circulating.\n\nCity manager is saying, not true. They're talking about these Haitian immigrants, 12 to 15 '000 of them who are there under a federal refugee program can be in the country legally until at least 2026. But does that stop JD Vance from posting about it on X? No, he says, months ago, I raised the issue of Haitian illegal immigrants draining social services and generally causing chaos, chaos all over Springfield, Ohio. Reports now show that people have their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn't be in this country.\n\nWhere is our borders are? mean, I don't even see the eaten one is just like, my gosh.\n\nWhat's sad is this is the way the system is supposed to work. We're a country that does bring in people who are in danger elsewhere. And in Haiti, life is cheap. People are getting slaughtered. So this is not illegal. This isn't the loose border. This was by design. And by all accounts, it's going pretty well. The city's only point is this is a 30 % increase roughly in our population. We don't have the\n\ncomparable increases in our police and fire department, and that's not in our budget, so we could use some help from the federal government as we accommodate this. Perfenically reasonable, sober conversation we should be having. If we move a bunch of refugees into a city, there should be assistance to that city to accommodate it. But these guys have turned it into utter nonsense. Where does mature conversation go anymore?\n\nWell, and so President Donald Trump, their campaign, cited the Daily Mail, which cited an unsupported statement during a city commission meeting. There were also people, I kid you not, quoting an anonymous Facebook post that described a neighbor's daughter's friend who discovered their cat had been strung up. Who would buy that? That is the most asinine, far -flated, I don't know. You just can't make this stuff up.\n\nWell, it's sad because these are people who are our leaders or want to be leaders. And what you count on in leaders is thoughtful discussion, thoughtful approaches. And they're just ridiculous, flame throwing liars, yet again, telling big lies to scare the hell out of the population. You know what their problem is? They keep trying to convince everybody that immigration is a big problem. And in Ohio, that's not what people are talking about.\n\nThey're talking about childcare. They're talking about grocery prices. They're talking about the cost of college tuition. They're talking about paycheck to paycheck living. We don't have an immigration problem in Ohio as much as Bernie Moreno, who's an immigrant, I should point out, is trying to convince us. We do have an immigration problem in Ohio. It's Bernie Moreno.\n\nRight, we are really far from the Mexican border in Ohio. We have a Canadian border. I am a Canadian immigrant, but as far as I know, nobody's pointing fingers at the Canadians saying they're causing problems. But that doesn't stop.\n\nWell, I kind of point the finger at a Canadian and say she's causing problems.\n\ngeneral, just one specific one. But Attorney General Dave Yost, I mean, he's jumping in on this. This is the top law enforcement person official in our state. And he's putting out these statements that say migrants are causing car crashes, stealing property, including livestock. How much livestock is in Springfield, Ohio? It's a city. I don't know that there are cows in the backyard, squatting in homes and killing wildlife for food.\n\nThe problem is not migrants. It's way too many migrants in a short period of time, a massive increase in the population without any communication or assistance from the federal government. And that's where it is, right? Because they're going to blame the federal government here. So they can point fingers at Biden and the Democratic president and say it's all their fault. That's why we need Trump in the White House.\n\nDon't you think Dave Yost would have learned his lesson about jumping on bogus news with the seven year old, yeah, the 10 year old abortion, you know, when he cast doubts that she even existed. You'd think that he'd say, wait, wait, wait, before I start throwing gasoline on the fire, maybe I should get my facts right. He was a journalist once, you know, you would think he would respect getting it right. You're listening to Today in Ohio.\n\nIs the state going to spend $400 ,000 to circulate a flat out lie from Frank LaRose about the anti -gerrymandering amendment on our November ballot? Layla.\n\nWell, that's very possible, Chris. The state has just approved spending that money on newspaper ads to, know, air quotes educate voters about issue one, which is the redistricting reform amendment. The state constitution requires the ads to run in newspapers in each of the state's 88 counties once a week in the three weeks before the November 5th election. Now, the ads will include the full ballot language.\n\nalong with the official arguments for and against the measure. But here's the kicker, the language for the amendment is still up in the air because there's a lawsuit pending about it and the Ohio Supreme Court hasn't made a final decision yet. And despite this legal limbo, the state had to approve the ad spending by a deadline this week. So the money's been approved, but they won't actually publish the ads until the court gives the go ahead. Democrats on the state controlling board, which is the group that voted on this,\n\ntried to delay this decision until the court settled things, but Republicans on the board rejected that attempt at delay and went ahead with locking in the ad space anyway. And their reasoning was that it's better to be safe than sorry. We'll secure the ad space now and decide what goes in the ads later. But, you know, this is important because the language that's in dispute was written by the ballot board, which is run by Secretary of State, Frank LaRosa, Republican.\n\nAnd the Democrats and backers of the amendment are concerned because they feel the current language was forced to mislead or it was misleading to voters by suggesting the amendment forces gerrymandering in favor of both Republicans and Democrats, even though it's actually meant to prevent gerrymandering. So we'll have to wait and see how the Supreme court rules on the ballot language before the ads go out.\n\nYou're being kind and saying suggesting they call this amendment gerrymandering, which is a flat out lie. We cannot stress that enough. That is a lie of the highest order. It's the opposite of gerrymandering. There is no definition of gerrymandering that would cover what this amendment does. That gerrymandering is where you skew the maps to favor one party over another. This amendment demands that you actually get the maps exactly proportional.\n\nto how Ohio votes. The fact that the ballot board and Frank Larose shoved that lie in there, they should all be thrown out of their jobs. And I gotta tell you, if the Supreme Court approves that, everybody who goes to the polls this November should vote out whoever's in the Supreme Court because this cannot stand. It's a lie and it should not be put in front of the people of Ohio and everybody involved in it. The ballot board should be ashamed of itself.\n\nfor telling the people of Ohio that massive lie and they should not be spending nearly half a million dollars to spread it.\n\nAnd know, Democrats are really worried that La Rose can't be trusted and that even if the court rejects the controversial ballot language, he might just go ahead and use it in the ads anyway. Do you think that that would be he would be so brazen as to use that language, even if the court rejects it?\n\nI would not put anything past him. He is not in any way a servant to the public. He is a servant to the Republican Party and he breaks the rules to do it. I've never seen anybody operate like him. It's every decision he makes is the opposite. We're going to be talking about another one in a few minutes. It's amazing how often he violates his oath to the people of Ohio by making contrary decisions. You're listening to Today in Ohio.\n\nI'm going anything past that. He is not in any way a servant to the public. He is a servant to the Republican Party and to the race for the rule of I've never seen anything operate like this. It's every decision he makes, it's obvious. We're going be talking about another one in a few minutes. It's amazing how often he violates the rules of the people of Ohio by making these kinds decisions. I'm going be listening to Today in Ohio.\n\nControversial Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson has a new accuser and for the first time the allegation is actually rape. What does his accuser say happen Lisa and how might this figure into his future in Cleveland?\n\nSo the lawsuit was filed Monday in Harris County, Houston, Texas district court by Jane Doe. She accuses Watson of sexual assault and battery back in October of 2020.\n\nApparently they met in July of that year and then arranged a meeting later at her apartment. So he came over and she alleges in the suit that he took off his clothes almost immediately, laid down and demanded a massage. And she apparently complied. And then he pointed to his buttocks and says, I want you to massage my buttocks. At this point, the lawsuit said she was terrified. The filing also says she became, he became upset with the massage and then sexually assaulted her.\n\nSo apparently at some point she grabbed a heavy decor item that was sitting on the dresser and threatened him with it and told him to get out. And he did leave, he left enraged according to the lawsuit. She said in the suit that she was worried about reporting these allegations because of Watson's star status in Houston at the time. And since that she's been suffering panic attacks and nervous breakdowns. Her attorney is\n\nTony Busby of Houston. He's the man who represented the other two dozen women who had sexual harassment or assault claims against Watson. We reached out to Rusty Harden, another powerful Houston attorney who has represented Watson in these other cases. He's not listed as the attorney of record on this new case, so I don't know. We're waiting to hear.\n\nWe should point out that in a civil case, the standard that you must get across to a jury is a preponderance of evidence, unlike in a criminal case where it's beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no corresponding criminal charge. Busby said he doesn't know if to file a police report at this point. Because it's rape, though, I think in Houston, the statute of limitations are in Texas. It's five years. So it would still be within that window.\n\nBut it puts the Browns and the NFL in a challenging position. The rape allegation is a new one. And they are pretty strict with people who are accused of that kind of sexual violence. And I guess in some ways, they could banish him from playing, and the Browns could drop his contract under certain scenarios.\n\nWell, and I haven't found any verification, but plenty of people said that there is an out in the Browns contract. I don't know the details of that. I don't know if it's true, but I mean, this could give them cause, I guess, to do something. I don't know.\n\nWell, and we should remind everybody that Brown's owners, and Jimmy Haslam, knew of the previous allegations against the Sean Watson. But after talking to him, they said they felt comfortable with him. We'll see if they have the same comfort as this case continues.\n\nWell, but let's not forget that those cases were all no -billed by two different grand juries in Houston. I just want to throw that out there. And I did find a quote, apparently Busby did talk to USA Today Sports. He says he's going to pursue this case aggressively and he wants a jury trial on this one.\n\nHe always says that, and then they settle. I think they settled every single case, didn't they?\n\nMy guess is that the Haslums are going to be less comfortable with this now that they realize how bad he sucks. If this gives him an out on that contract, let's see how they use this to their advantage.\n\nYeah, many, many people believe that the deal they made for him may be just the worst football deal ever made. it's saddled Cleveland with mediocrity for years. They gave up all their draft picks and brought in a guy who's not that good. So you're right, Laila. It might be interesting now that they know what his quality is, whether they're less willing to stand by his side. This all happens, of course, is they are trying to jack the public for $1 .2 billion for a stadium. You're listening to Today in Ohio.\n\nHow are the political campaigns getting all our cell phone numbers, Laura, and bombarding us with text messages begging and begging and begging us for money? And is there anything we can do about it?\n\nNo, not really. You can respond stop as much as you want and maybe that specific one will stop. But we're talking about a whole lot of different groups that have your number literally and it's legal and they can keep doing it. here's one I got. I was prepping for this podcast. came in. It said presidential straw poll before Kamala Harris hits the debate stage. Confirm you're voting for Harris, not Trump. It's reply here. I always delete these. I always say report junk.\n\nI just keep going them. I get ones addressed to my husband, but apparently they're legal because they're considered manually sent and they proliferated since the 2021 US Supreme Court ruling. It loosened consent requirements for these mass texting systems. In the 2022 midterms campaigns and other political groups that more than 15 billion political texts. I can only imagine we're going up exponentially from there because these campaigns buy the list of potential\n\ntargets by from data brokers. They compile them from a combination of state voter records, third party consumer data, lists of verified cell phone numbers, and basically just data that you can buy for the right price. And they're trying to get small donations from people or to click on something to show that you are supporting. I don't know if I had clicked on that, what that would have done.\n\nI got the same one. look, I'm overrun. I mean, I've gotten them every year and I've never donated to a political campaign and I'm a registered independent. I get them from Donald Trump, which is kind of funny because, you know, people know I think he's the worst human being ever to be on the political stage. But I got to say the Harris Walls campaign is by far, by far the worst I've ever seen. I've been hitting stop. I've been reporting junk.\n\nDay after day after day I get multiple messages from them each day and I can't get them to stop I I wish there were a law but you know the lawmakers are the ones that pass these laws and so they exempt themselves But it causes serious resentment I don't want that junk in my phone and it just keeps coming and coming and it's don't you get the message? No go away\n\nRight, I completely agree because your phone all of a sudden is like, your iCloud is full, your storage. it's like what? Because I have all these stupid text messages that I don't want in the first place. So that's why I've been deleting them as soon as they get in there so they don't take up space on my phone. But I guess they do this because it works. If it didn't work, they wouldn't do it. mean, is this going to change the way you vote? I mean, it's not going to change the way I vote. But I really do want to just tell them, I'm not going to spend money on you. I'm not going to support your campaign.\n\nand you're really just annoying the heck out of people. You really want to like you.\n\nBut it's pathetic begging. It's like, hey, we only have 12 hours. The other side is doing X. We got 12 hours and you haven't given us anything. It's almost implying guilt because you haven't given anything. I think it builds resentment.\n\nI think it does too. And quite honestly, all of my text messages have been Democrats. I mean, they must know I'm a Democrat or I voted Democrat because I've not gotten any Trump, no Moreno, no Republican ones at all. And as I said in the round table on Saturday, we talked about this and I'm like, we've been warned not to click on unsolicited texts. How do we know these are even legit?\n\nRight. And I mean, that's not even talking about the email. I probably get more than 100 solicitations every day from all the campaigns. And I mean, part of that is being a reporter, right? You just get that stuff. But I wonder how many other people are getting this stuff every day. And you just want it to go away.\n\nI wish tonight in the debate one of the questions would be you're annoying the hell out of America by begging them for money. Will you pledge to change the laws so you outlaw these text messages? Put them on the record.\n\nIf we do that, can we also talk about TV ads and emails? Because I just feel like you turn around and you're just bombarded.\n\nYou're listening to Today in Ohio. Did Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost ask Ohio Supreme Court Justice Pat DeWine to recuse himself a few years ago from the redistricting case in which DeWine's dad, the governor, was a key player? Nope. So, Layla, how does he justify seeking the recusal of a different justice in a separate party in a case that also involves redistricting?\n\nThis is becoming quite the legal showdown here. you're right, Chris, it seems really hypocritical for Yoast given the Pat DeWine situation from a while back. So Democratic State Supreme Court Justice Jennifer Bruner just rejected a request from Republicans to remove herself from the major redistricting lawsuit that was filed by citizens, not politicians, over the ballot language of this proposed amendment seeking to create the independent redistricting process. As we mentioned earlier, Republicans who control the Ohio ballot board\n\nwrote the language in a way that says that the amendment requires gerrymandering, which is the exact opposite of what it's supposed to do. And Yost asked Bruner to step aside from this case because last year she filed a different lawsuit challenging a state law that involves Republican Secretary of State, Frank LaRose, who also happens to be tied to this redistricting lawsuit.\n\nThat other lawsuit was challenging a state law that requires judicial candidates to list their partisan affiliations on the ballot. So Yost's argument was that Bruner couldn't be impartial on this case. But on Monday, Bruner said, nope, there's no merit to that. And she's staying on the case. Specifically, she drew upon Yost's own arguments from the redistricting lawsuit when the Democratic minority on the ballot board filed arguments with the court independent of the Republican majority.\n\nYost tried to have those arguments struck from the record. He said the ballot board functions as a single unit and not as a collective of its individual members. So when Bruner wrote her letter rejecting this demand that she recuse herself, she said, hey, remember how you said the ballot board functions as a collective? Well, that flies in the face of your claim that I would be judging LaRose as an individual apart from that collective. I thought that was pretty brilliant. So Bruner's decision is obviously significant because\n\nIn past redistricting cases, the Democrats on the court have always kind of hung together. They've been on that side with the courts, four Republicans on the other.\n\nLook, Pat DeWine's refusal to recuse himself in a case that could have held his dad in contempt was the height of hypocrisy on any court. There's no way that wasn't a conflict of interest. And our attorney general was silent on that. But here he is going after a Democratic justice on an issue that's so much more gray. It's hypocrisy, again, in our highest levels of office in Ohio.\n\nYou know, maybe I'm being Pollyanna about this, but this decision on the ballot language really seems about as cut and dried as it could possibly be, right? If the language that Lerose proposed says that the proposal would require gerrymandering, that couldn't be more patently false. This should be a unanimous decision on the court's part, regardless of party affiliation. you know, of course this is Ohio, so I guess anything can happen here.\n\nRight, they should say it as clearly as possible and spank him and say, cut it out. Stop playing politics with your job. You're supposed to represent the citizens in elections matters and you represent everybody, not just people in your party. He's he's terrible. And we're to talk about him again in a minute. You're listening to Today in Ohio. Lisa does Ohio Secretary of State, Frank LaRose, have two standards for making decisions on candidates being on the ballot?\n\nI should say it as clearly as possible and spank it. It's like cut it out, stop playing politics. You're supposed to represent its citizens in elections matters and you represent everybody, not just the people who party. He's terrible.\n\nincluding one just for white males like himself. How does he justify his decision to keep someone on the ballot who failed to disclose a name change as state law requires?\n\nSo LaRose ruled that District 59 Republican State Representative Tex Fisher can remain on the\n\nthe Mahoning County November ballot, despite not listing a 2020 name change in his candidate paperwork. This would be in violation of an Ohio law that requires candidates to list all names they've used in the last five years, even though there's no space on the form to put those former names. So Fisher changed his legal name from Austin James Fisher to Austin James Texford Fisher.\n\nThe chair of the Mahoning County Democratic Party, Chris Anderson filed a complaint against Fisher. And then LaRose's ruling broke a two -two tie on the Mahoning County Board of Elections. which was a party line vote. The Dems were against or for it and the others were against it. But LaRose says the requirement only applies to statements of candidacy and nominating petitions.\n\nFisher got on the ballot because he was an appointee. He was appointed in June by the local Republican party to replace Al Cutrona, who resigned his seat in June for Ohio Senate appointment. So he didn't submit that paperwork because he was appointed. So I don't know, that sounds a little bit like weak sauce, but Fisher says it was really disheartening to deal with this petty, blatantly partisan stunt by the board.\n\nHe says it's overly harsh and unfair, and he would, if elected, introduce a bill to make it a penalty for not listing, to reduce the penalty for not listing previous names on the paperwork.\n\nIt is harsh and unfair, but it did take somebody off the ballot this year. I mean, how do you do two different standards? LaRose is using a technicality to take care of a Republican, but this is not right. You can't have separate standards. Somebody got yanked off the ballot because they were transgender who changed their name and didn't disclose it on the form, which doesn't have a place to disclose it.\n\nand then they allow this guy to stay on it. doesn't make sense that we have the double standard. Frank Laroche had stepped in earlier and made sure the other candidate also could be on the ballot.\n\nWell, I guess the only reason he stepped in was to break the tie because Vanessa Joy, the transgender Democratic candidate, was left off the District 50 primary ballot by the Stark County Board of Elections. But two other transgender candidates in other counties were allowed to stay on their ballot. And interestingly enough, Fisher actually supports, he says there was no clear intent to deceive voters in his case and Vanessa Joy's case. So he's kind of backing her up a little bit.\n\nYeah, I mean, the right thing is actually happening here. He shouldn't get kicked off the ballot, but Vanessa Joyce shouldn't have been kicked off the ballot either. That's where the wrong thing happened. You're listening to Today in Ohio. U .S. Senator JD Vance and some colleagues took a loss in a U .S. appeals court in Cincinnati, even though the judges seemed to agree with everything that Vance was arguing. All right, this is a complicated case involving campaign spending. Simplify it for us.\n\nOkay, so this is about overturning federal limits on the political party's ability to coordinate the spending with the candidates. It's about how much the parties can give the candidates themselves in order to get elected. And this is the US Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. like you said, agreed with these plaintiffs, but they said, we can't overturn a 2001 Supreme Court ruling that upheld the limits, that that would have to come from the Supreme Court itself. These caps were established in 1972 in a campaign finance law.\n\nAnd they're currently $32 million for a presidential candidate, $1 .1 million for a Senate candidate in Ohio. It differs in different states, $62 ,000 for a House candidate in Ohio. And while the Supreme Court overturned federal limits on overall party spending on candidates in 1996, then in 2001, they upheld these limits. They said that eliminating them would allow donors to circumvent federal limits and contribute to corruption, which...\n\nWe love to talk about corruption on this podcast. It just, I get what they're saying. I'm all for upholding campaign finance laws and making sure things are above board and that you're not swaying too much with the campaign money. But when we have dark money groups that can collect as much money and don't have to tell you where and can spend it on whatever candidate they want, it just seems like this is.\n\nobsolete this limit in the face of what else is happening in campaign finance. Right.\n\nwhich is what they argued and what the judges agreed to. They just said, we're not going to overrule the Supreme Court. They have to overrule themselves, tossing it up. So I'm sure it'll be appealed and there'll be some sort of decision that comes out of that.\n\nAnd it'll be like, hey, give as much money as you want to these people and keep texting everybody you know.\n\nYou're listening to Today in Ohio. Well, do we finally have a date when that old Sheridan Hotel at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport is coming down to make way for much needed parking?\n\nThis place has been sitting vacant. It's in really rough shape for the past year. And demolition is finally set to begin on October 1st, and it could take up to four months to finish the job. The Sheraton opened way back in 1959, but its condition has gone downhill. Partly due to the pandemic's hit on travel, the city actually paid over $12 million last year to end the lease with the private company that ran the hotel. And it's been closed since May of 2022.\n\nNow Cleveland based Bauman Enterprises will be handling the demolition for just over two million as part of a four million dollar contract to take down several buildings on airport property. So you know what's next for the site in the short term it's going to be turned into more parking. That's great news because parking at Hopkins has been tight lately. Air travels booming again with passenger numbers expected to hit over 10 million this year. That's the highest since 2008.\n\nAnd unlike 2008 when Cleveland was a hub for continental airlines, most of those passengers now are starting or ending their trips in Cleveland, which really puts extra pressure on parking.\n\nI don't remember, did it say exactly how many more spaces we'll get?\n\nwell, that's significant. I still don't understand why Cleveland tore down that other garage back when Frank Jackson was mayor that had tons of additional parking because it helped solve what was needed. But they tore that thing down without explaining it.\n\nYeah, seems like they're moving in the right direction of solving their parking problems. I there's talk of adding a second parking garage down the line, and they're giving travelers some relief on that. And you experience their smart parking garage to help manage the demand during busy times like holidays and spring break.\n\nYeah, they are. They're trying to make a difference. Plus there's all the off airport lots that so many people use that I guess are also, they find them convenient. Not me, but others. You're listening to Today in Ohio. That's going to do it for the Tuesday episode. Thanks, Lisa. Thanks, Laura. Thanks, Leila. We'll be back on Wednesday talking about the news, but we will be off on Thursday and Friday, returning on Monday. Thanks for listening.",

                "title": "AP-NORC/USAFacts poll: Republicans are more likely to trust Trump than official election results",
                "body": "CHICAGO (AP) -- For Christopher Pugh, the 2020 election was a turning point.\n\nHe already distrusted the government. But as he watched Fox News coverage in the immediate aftermath of the election and read posts on Twitter, the social media platform now known as X, that distrust grew. He now believes the falsehood that the 2020 election was stolen and trusts few people other than former President Donald Trump to deliver him news about election results.\n\n\"I trust Donald Trump, not the government,\" said the 38-year-old Republican from Gulfport, Mississippi. \"That's it.\"\n\nWhile most Americans trust government-certified election results at least a \"moderate\" amount, Republicans are more likely to trust Trump and his campaign, according to a new survey from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and USAFacts. Americans also are heading into the November election with concerns about misinformation. Many have low trust that the information they receive from presidential candidates -- particularly Trump, but also Vice President Kamala Harris -- is based on factual information.\n\nTrump continues to lie about the outcome of the 2020 election, saying it was rigged against him even after dozens of his court challenges failed, reviews, recounts and audits in battleground states all affirmed President Joe Biden's win, and Trump's own attorney general said there was no evidence of widespread fraud. Despite no evidence of any widespread fraud, a 2023 poll found that most Republicans believe Biden was not legitimately elected president.\n\nAs Trump runs as the Republican candidate for the third time, he also is signaling that he can only lose through widespread fraud. Over the weekend he threatened to prosecute those \"involved in unscrupulous behavior\" this election should he win in November.\n\n\"The only way they can beat us is to cheat,\" Trump said at a Las Vegas rally in June.\n\nThe recent findings from the AP-NORC survey show that a significant chunk of Trump's supporters might be more inclined to believe what he says about the upcoming election results than they are to trust government certifications of election results.\n\nAbout two-thirds of Republicans trust Trump's campaign at least a moderate amount to provide accurate information about the results of the 2024 election, while only about half say the same about the official certifications of results, the survey found. By contrast, about 9 in 10 Democrats trust the government certification at least a moderate amount, and an overwhelming majority, 82%, also have at least a moderate amount of trust in Harris and her campaign.\n\nMost Americans -- around 7 in 10 -- trust the government certifications of election results at least a moderate amount, according to the survey. Majorities also trust national and local TV news networks, as well as local or national newspapers, to provide accurate information about the outcome of this year's presidential election.\n\nDanielle Almeida, a 45-year-old Democrat from Briarcliff Manor, New York, said she trusts government-certified election results and finds it alarming that some Americans don't.\n\n\"In order to have a democracy, we have to trust the system and the results of our elections,\" she said, adding that she thinks Trump \"does not care about fact-checking because he believes his supporters don't care, either.\"\n\nAmericans are less likely to trust the campaigns overall -- compared to sources such as the government and the media -- but they have a higher level of trust in Harris and her campaign than in Trump and his campaign to provide accurate information about the outcome of the election. About half have at least a \"moderate\" amount of trust in Harris and her campaign. By contrast, about 4 in 10 have at least a moderate amount of trust in Trump and his campaign.\n\nSome Republicans' distrust of election results started far before the 2020 election.\n\nRichard Baum, 60, a conservative independent from Odessa, Texas, said his suspicions began in the 2000 U.S. presidential race between George W. Bush and Al Gore. After Bush won by a slim margin, \"hanging chads\" became an unlikely symbol of a disputed presidential election as small anomalies common in elections ballooned into major national controversies.\n\n\"There was some stuff there that didn't seem right that made a lot of doubts in my mind about if you can trust the government,\" Baum said.\n\nBaum said he would trust election results only if voting took place on only a single day, early voting and mail-in ballots were banned and photo IDs were required at all polling places.\n\nMany Americans doubt the veracity of both presidential candidates' campaign messages, but skepticism about Trump's campaign is higher, the USAFacts/AP-NORC survey found.\n\nAbout 6 in 10 Americans believe that Trump's campaign messages are \"rarely\" or \"never\" based on factual information, compared to 45% who say that about Harris' campaign messages.\n\nMany Americans also say it's hard to discern fact from fiction when it comes to the candidates. Slightly less than half of Americans say it's \"very easy\" or \"somewhat easy\" to find factual information about the candidates and their positions, and only about one-third say it's easy to know if what candidates are saying is true or not.\n\nAbout 6 in 10 Americans say it's easy for them to understand the difference between fact and opinion when it comes to information about the upcoming presidential election, but only about 4 in 10 say it's easy to know whether information is true or not.\n\nAmericans are, however, more confident about factual information related to election logistics: About 7 in 10 Americans say it's easy to find information about how to register to vote, and about 6 in 10 say it's easy to find information about how to cast their ballot.\n\nMichele Martin, a 56-year-old Pennsylvania Democrat, said she is \"very concerned\" about misinformation from politicians but finds it much easier to access basic voter information.\n\n\"It's online. It's mailed to you. It's not hard to find,\" she said.\n\nAbout 8 in 10 Americans say that when it comes to getting information about the government, the spread of misinformation is a \"major problem.\" That is essentially unchanged from when the question was asked in 2020.\n\nLisa Kuda, a 57-year-old Republican from Palm Harbor, Florida, said she gets most of her news from social media and friends. She said she feels alienated from most news sources other than Fox News.\n\n\"Misinformation is everywhere,\" she said. \"It's really difficult to find information about candidates.\"\n\nWhen Americans see news about the election and want to find out whether it's true, 40% say they turn to an internet search first. Much smaller shares -- around 1 in 10 for each -- say they first check cable news, national TV news or social media.\n\nBaum, from Texas, said he finds it difficult to easily access information about candidates because he believes social media platforms \"are censoring conservative ideologies.\" He also doesn't trust Google and instead turns to conservative networks and podcasts such One America News and conservative podcasters to fact-check claims he's unsure about.\n\nAlmeida's process looks much different. She starts with a Google search and wades through multiple articles from news outlets such as The New York Times and NBC News, making note of any differences. If multiple articles have the same information, she said, she's more likely to trust it.\n\n\"Misinformation is a huge problem,\" she said. \"You have to take time to do your research.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Ali Swenson in New York contributed to this report.

                "title": "How Harris' and Trump's tax and spending plans affect US debt",
                "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican opponent Donald Trump have floated new tax breaks and spending plans, as they try to win votes by persuading Americans their ideas will do more to ease their financial burdens.\n\nBudget forecasters are struggling to keep up with the latest tweaks, and new ideas may be voiced in Tuesday's Harris-Trump debate, but so far all estimates show Trump's agenda piling up much more new federal debt.\n\nTrump has said he plans to extend all tax cuts he pushed through Congress in 2017, exempt Social Security and tip income from taxes, and further cut corporate income taxes.\n\nThese changes would likely add $3.6 trillion to $6.6 trillion to primary U.S. deficits over 10 years, according to published individual and comprehensive estimates from four budget forecasters reviewed by Reuters: the Penn-Wharton Budget Model, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), the Tax Foundation and Oxford Economics.\n\nHarris' plans, which include expanding the Child Tax Credit, a $6,000 bonus tax credit for newborns, a $25,000 first-time homebuyer tax credit, and no taxes on tips, could reduce deficits by as much as $400 billion or add up to $1.4 trillion to deficits over a decade, the same forecasters calculated.\n\nThe estimates are based on static budget scoring, and are compared against the Congressional Budget Office's current-law \"baseline,\" which already assumes a massive, $22 trillion increase in debt through 2034.\n\nROLLING ANALYSIS\n\nThe forecasts vary considerably depending on which ideas mentioned on the campaign trail are included.\n\nEstimates of Harris' recently rolled-out tax deduction of up to $50,000 for business startup costs, and a lower top capital gains tax than the one proposed by President Joe Biden are largely not included.\n\nThe forecasts include Trump's proposal to lower the corporate income tax to 15% from 21% but not his latest comments that this rate would be reserved only for companies that produce their goods in the U.S.\n\n\"The campaign talking points are moving faster than the budget models,\" said Shai Akabas, economic policy director for the Bipartisan Policy Center. \"I think we're largely seeing what we've come to expect in recent years, which is that candidates are going to put their popular policy priorities ahead of fiscal responsibility on both sides.\"\n\nCongress must approve tax and spending legislation, making it difficult for the winner of the Nov. 5 election to achieve their priorities without sweeping majorities in both the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n\n2025 TAX CLIFF\n\nThe major differentiator between Trump and Harris is how they address the 2025 expiration of individual tax cuts passed by Republicans during Trump's presidency in 2017. Without action by Congress, these rates would snap back to their previous, higher levels.\n\nTrump has pledged to permanently extend all of the expiring tax cuts, including for the wealthiest Americans, which tax and budget experts estimate would reduce revenues over a decade by about $3.3 trillion to $4 trillion.\n\nHarris would extend the 2017 tax cuts for only those earning under $400,000, keeping a Biden pledge, but this would add up to $2.5 trillion to a spending agenda already estimated at $2 trillion over a decade.\n\nHarris has quietly endorsed the nearly $5 trillion in tax hikes in Biden's fiscal 2025 budget request, including taxing unrealized gains from fortunes over $100 billion and raising the corporate tax rate to 28%\n\nThis has caused consternation on Wall Street but would substantially offset the cost of her spending plans.\n\n\"I think the conclusion that Trump's approach to taxes is more debt-fueled is correct,\" said Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. \"I say that because Harris at least has some pretty well-developed revenue raisers.\"\n\nTrump has not offered any conventional tax increases to offset his extended tax cuts. Other breaks, including exempting Social Security income, would reduce revenue by $1.6 trillion, CRFB and the Tax Foundation estimate.\n\nThe conservative-leaning Tax Foundation called the move \"unsound and fiscally irresponsible,\" weakening Social Security and Medicare.\n\nTrump has said his tax cuts would be paid for with \"trillions of dollars\" generated by stronger economic growth, new import tariffs, ending Biden's clean energy subsidies and a new government efficiency commission headed by billionaire entrepreneur and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\n\nThe Tax Policy Center has estimated that Trump's proposed 10% global tariff and 60% tariff on Chinese imports could raise up to $3.8 trillion over a decade but would reduce other revenues due to its economic effects, including imposing a de facto tax on households.\n\nThe Tax Foundation was the only model reviewed that included a tariff estimate as an offset -- $2.6 trillion -- but even then, it estimated that Trump's plans would boost deficits by nearly $4 trillion over a decade.\n\n(Reporting by David Lawder; Editing by Heather Timmons and Jonathan Oatis)",

                "title": "Congress honors 13 troops killed during Kabul withdrawal",
                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Speaker Mike Johnson is hosting a ceremony Tuesday to posthumously present Congress' highest honor -- the Congressional Gold Medal -- to 13 U.S. service members who were killed during the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, even as the politics of a presidential election swirl around the event.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans supported the legislation to honor the 13 U.S. troops, who were killed along with more than 170 Afghans in a suicide bombing at Abbey Gate near Kabul's Airport in August 2021. President Joe Biden signed the legislation in December 2021. The top Republican and Democratic leaders for both the House and Senate are expected to speak at Tuesday's ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda.\n\nThe event is taking place against the backdrop of a bitter back and forth over who is to blame for the rushed and deadly evacuation from Kabul. Johnson scheduled the ceremony just hours before the first debate between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump.\n\nHouse Republicans also released a scathing investigation on Sunday into the withdrawal that cast blame on Biden's administration and minimized the role of Trump, who had signed the withdrawal deal with the Taliban.\n\nJohnson, a Louisiana Republican and Trump ally, praised the House report, which was led by the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Republican Rep. Michael McCaul.\n\n\"We must not allow the Biden-Harris Administration to rewrite history,\" Johnson said in a statement. \"The families of the 13 fallen servicemembers and the allies we abandoned in Afghanistan deserve better.\"\n\nWhite House national security spokesman John Kirby on Monday criticized the House report as partisan and one-sided, and said it revealed little new information as well as several inaccuracies. He noted that evacuation plans had started well before the pullout and the U.S. did not hand over equipment to the Taliban. He said the fall of Kabul \"moved a lot faster than anyone could have anticipated.\"\n\nHe also acknowledged that during the evacuation \"not everything went according to plan. Nothing ever does.\"\n\n\"We hold ourselves all accountable for that,\" he said of the deaths.\n\nKirby added there would be \"quite a few\" people from the Department of Defense at the ceremony Tuesday.\n\nThe top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, also issued a memorandum in response to the GOP report, saying he was concerned by the \"attempts to politicize the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.\"\n\n\"Republicans' partisan attempts to garner headlines rather than acknowledge the full facts and substance of their investigation have only increased with the heat of an election season,\" Meeks said.\n\nPentagon reviews have concluded that the suicide bombing was not preventable, and that suggestions troops may have seen the would-be bomber were not true.\n\nRegardless, Trump has thrust the withdrawal, with the backing from some of the families of the Americans killed, into the center of his campaign. Last month, his political team distributed video of him attending a wreath-laying ceremony for the fallen service members at Arlington National Cemetery on the third anniversary of the bombing, despite the cemetery's prohibition on partisan activity on the grounds as well as an altercation with a cemetery employee who was trying to make sure the campaign followed those rules.\n\nThe Gold Star military families who invited him to the Arlington ceremony have defended Trump's actions. At a fiery news conference outside the Capitol Monday, they implored for the House report to be taken seriously and demanded accountability for those in leadership during evacuation from Kabul.\n\n\"President Trump is certainly not perfect. But he's a far better choice, in my opinion, than the mess that Biden and Harris have created since Kabul,\" said Paula Knauss Selph, whose son Ryan Knauss died in the Abbey Gate attack.\n\nWhile Trump and Republicans have sought to link Harris to the withdrawal as a campaign issue, and Harris has said she was the last person in the room when Biden made his decision, neither watchdog reviews nor the 18-month investigation by House Republicans have identified any instance where the vice president had a significant impact on decision-making.\n\nStill, House Republicans argued that Harris, as well as Biden's national security team, needed to face accountability for the consequences of the deadly withdrawal.\n\n\"Kamala Harris wants to be the president of the United States. She wants to be commander in chief. She needs to answer for this report immediately,\" said Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican on the committee.\n\nMcCaul, the chairman, also defended the timing of the report by saying that the committee's investigation had to overcome resistance from the Biden administration.\n\nHe cast the investigation as a \"truth-seeking mission\" rather than a partisan endeavor, but also bragged that out of all the investigations that House Republicans have launched into the Biden administration in the last two years \"this investigation is the one they fear the most.\"\n\nMost assessments have concluded Trump and Biden share blame for the disastrous end to America's longest war, which saw enemy Taliban take over Afghanistan again before the last American troops even flew out of the Kabul airport. The main U.S. government watchdog for the war points to Trump's 2020 deal with the Taliban to withdraw all U.S. forces and military contractors as \"the single most important factor\" in the collapse of U.S.-allied Afghan security forces and Taliban takeover.\n\nBiden's April 2021 announcement that he would proceed with the withdrawal set in motion by Trump was the second-biggest factor, the watchdog said.\n\nBoth Trump and Biden kept up the staged withdrawal of U.S. forces, and in Trump's case sharply cut back important U.S. airstrikes in the Taliban, even though the Taliban failed to enter into substantive negotiations with the U.S.-backed civilian government as required by Trump's withdrawal deal.\n\nAssociated Press writer Colleen Long contributed to this report.",

Most polling finds either candidate winning by small margins that fall within the margin of error, indicating they are basically tied.\n\nA New York Times-Sienna College poll released over the weekend showed Trump leading Harris 48-47 among likely voters. Polling averages from the New York Times also show Harris is tied with Trump or holds small leads in the seven swing states that will decide the election, another indication it is anyone's race to win.\n\nHarris' campaign has framed itself as the underdog in the race, arguing Trump is effectively running as an incumbent even though she is currently the vice president. Trump has suggested his campaign will cruise to victory as long as the election has held fairly, a reference to his false claims of fraud from the 2020 election.\n\nPIVOTAL NIGHT FOR BOTH CANDIDATES\n\nWith the race so close and ballots being sent out to voters in some states in the coming weeks, both candidates are looking to make their mark in the race to gain an advantage heading into Election Day.\n\nSo far it is the only debate both candidates have agreed to, meaning that it may be the only time Harris and Trump appear on stage together. A vice presidential debate involving Republican JD Vance and Democrat Tim Walz is scheduled for Oct. 1.\n\nThe debate will offer each of them a sizable audience and their best chance to lay out their case to the American people, primarily undecided voters and independents. Both are expected to show stark contrasts between each other, with Trump framing Harris as an incompetent leader that has fueled the problems with inflation and crisis at the border, while Harris is likely to label the former president a threat to democracy and seek to blame him for the restriction of abortion rights in the wake of Roe v. Wade.\n\nMICS OFF\n\nHarris' campaign lost its adamant push to keep the microphones turned on while it is not a candidate's turn to speak, a continuation of a rule that President Joe Biden was adamant about implementing when he was still the Democratic nominee.\n\nHarris unsuccessfully tried to dare Trump into reversing the muted microphones from the first debate, a move aimed at getting him to get off script and highlight the differences between them.\n\nAnalysts said turning microphones off during the debate with Biden helped Trump, who did not get penalized for interrupting the president or moderators like he did during the 2020 cycle.\n\nTrump's campaign tried to frame the push for hot microphones as Harris trying to lay out an escape route of the debate, though she has remained committed to Tuesday night.\n\nRULES AND HOW TO WATCH\n\nABC will carry the debate live on television and have a stream available online. It will begin at 9 p.m. ET and run for 90 minutes with two commercial breaks.\n\nAnchors David Muir and Linsey Davis will moderate the debate and be the only ones asking questions. Candidates are not allowed to ask each other anything.\n\nThere will be no opening statements, each candidate will get two minutes to answer a question, two minutes to respond to the other and an additional minute for \"follow-ups, clarifications or responses.\"",

                "body": "LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- The highest courts in two states ruled differently Monday on efforts by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to be removed from their presidential ballots, with a divided North Carolina Supreme Court affirming he should be omitted and the Michigan Supreme Court reversing a lower court decision and keeping him on.\n\nKennedy suspended his campaign more than two weeks ago and endorsed Republican nominee Donald Trump. The environmentalist and author has tried to get his name removed from ballots in several battleground states where the race between Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris are expected to be close.\n\nIn Michigan, Kennedy sued Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, on Aug. 30 in an attempt to remove his name from the ballot so as not to siphon votes away from Trump, who won Michigan by about 10,000 votes in 2016. Monday's decision reverses an intermediate-level Court of Appeals ruling made Friday. It ensures that Kennedy's name will appear on voters' ballots in Michigan despite his withdrawal from the race.\n\nThe Michigan Supreme Court said in a brief order that Kennedy \"has not shown an entitlement to this extraordinary relief.\"\n\nIn North Carolina, the state Supreme Court ruled 4-3 to deny efforts by the State Board of Elections to have the justices consider overturning a Court of Appeals decision on Friday directing that Kennedy be removed from ballots. The Court of Appeals order had reversed a trial judge's ruling the day before that upheld the State Board of Elections' decision to keep Kennedy and running mate Nicole Shanahan on the ballot.\n\nThe Democratic majority on the elections board had rejected the request by We The People party of North Carolina -- a recently certified party assembled to collect signatures for Kennedy's candidacy -- to withdraw Kennedy from the ballot. The board's majority said it was impractical given actions already completed to begin ballot distribution, including printing and coding tabulation machines. Kennedy sued the next day.\n\nA state law had required the first absentee ballots to be mailed or transmitted to voters who have already asked for them no later than 60 days before the general election, or last Friday. If it had occurred on time, North Carolina would have been the first state in the nation to distribute ballots for the Nov. 5 elections.\n\nThe North Carolina Supreme Court ruling means elections officials will have to reprint ballots without Kennedy and reassemble absentee ballot packets. Over 136,000 absentee ballot requests had been made as of late last week. More than 2.9 million absentee and in-person ballots with Kennedy's name on them had already been printed, according to the state board. Counties must pay for reprinting costs.\n\nMonday evening's order, backed by four of the court's five Republican justices, said it's clear Kennedy resigned as a candidate and that a vote for him would not count.\n\nState attorneys for the board have said it could take two weeks to get reprinted ballots out the door -- threatening violation of a federal law requiring absentee ballots be sent to military and overseas voters already requesting them by Sept. 21.\n\n\"We acknowledge that expediting the process of printing new ballots will require considerable time and effort by our election officials and significant expense to the State,\" the order reads. \"But that is a price the North Carolina Constitution expects us to incur to protect voters' fundamental right to vote their conscience and have that vote count.\"\n\nThe court's two Democratic justices -- Allison Riggs and Anita Earls -- and Republican Justice Richard Dietz each wrote separate dissents. Riggs said the \"whims\" of Kennedy \"have been elevated above the constitutional interests\" of voters who wanted to vote as soon as possible.\n\nAfter Monday night's order, North Carolina board Executive Director Karen Brinson Bell told county election officials not to mail any ballots until a statewide date is set. A potential waiver of the Sept. 21 federal deadline may be necessary, she wrote by email.\n\nOn the Michigan Supreme Court, justices nominated by Democrats currently hold a 4-3 majority. That court's order was unsigned, and two Republican-nominated justices wrote a dissenting opinion.\n\n\"We can only hope that the Secretary's misguided action -- now sanctioned with the imprimatur of this Court -- will not have national implications,\" the dissenting justices wrote.\n\nKennedy was nominated for president by the Natural Law Party in Michigan. Benson, Michigan's secretary of state, had previously cited a state law saying candidates who are nominated and accept a minor party's nomination \"shall not be permitted to withdraw.\"\n\nAngela Benander, spokesperson for Benson's office, said the department is grateful for the high court's \"swift response.\"\n\n\"Clerks can now move forward with the ballot printing process to ensure absentee ballots will be delivered to voters by the federal deadlines,\" Benander said in a statement.\n\nIn separate statements, Kennedy attorney Aaron Siri criticized the Michigan ruling but said the North Carolina decision \"will assure that nobody in North Carolina votes for a candidate who is no longer running in their state.\"",

                "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (WBTV) - Millions of ballots must be reprinted for the 2024 general election in North Carolina after the state Supreme Court ordered Monday that former candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s name be removed.\n\nNorth Carolina counties were supposed to begin sending out absentee ballots for this year's general election on Friday, Sept. 6. Counties were disrupted then by a court of appeals order requiring new ballots to be printed without Kennedy's name on them.\n\nA legal battle over the removal of Kennedy's name began in late August after the former independent presidential candidate dropped out of the race.\n\nOn Aug. 29, the North Carolina State Board of Elections voted in favor of keeping Kennedy's name on the ballot due to the monetary and logistical challenges that reprinting would cause. Members of the elections board argued then that nearly 2 million ballots had already been printed across dozens of counties by that time, and to reprint them would take time and be costly to taxpayers.\n\nIt would take at least 13 days to reprint and redistribute ballots without Kennedy's name, according to Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the state's elections board.\n\nKennedy sued the state board of elections in an effort to get his name removed from the ballot. A Wake County Superior Court judge on Sept. 5 ruled against Kennedy, telling the state to continue with its plans to send out already-printed ballots.\n\nKennedy appealed that decision to the North Carolina Court of Appeals and won last Friday, just as absentee ballots were expected to start getting mailed out. The elections board appealed to the state Supreme Court, which ordered on Monday, Sept. 9 that Kennedy's name must be removed from North Carolina ballots.\n\nAs of Monday, more than 2.9 million ballots had already been printed statewide. All of those ballots must be reprinted without Kennedy's name.\n\nPrior to the state Supreme Court's decision, the North Carolina Board of Elections said it was creating new ballot proofs to send to county elections boards in case a reprint became necessary.\n\n\"There are 2,348 different ballot styles statewide for the 2024 general election. More than 2.9 million ballots had already been printed before the order by the Court of Appeals,\" the board said Friday in a press release.\n\nElection workers throughout the state had to grapple with last-minute delays related to processing and sending absentee ballots. The state's board of elections instructed counties to not send or reprint any ballots until the legal battle was sorted.\n\n\"Elections in North Carolina are constantly changing, so we're just accustomed to that, and just roll with it and do what we need to do,\" Kristin Holloway, director of Union County's board of elections, told WBTV last week.\n\n---> Watch: North Carolina court battle over RFK Jr.'s name on ballot puts elections board in 'holding pattern'\n\nThere were about 3,000 requests for absentee ballots in North Carolina's Union County. In Mecklenburg County, where Charlotte is located, there were more than 100,000 absentee ballot requests.\n\nReprinting ballots without Kennedy's name will require extra work for many counties. According to Holloway in Union County, their board will have to talk to their vendors, get Kennedy's name removed, approve new ballots, reorder ballots, reprint them, redo their \"test deck,\" and then reprogram their equipment.\n\nCounty boards were legally required to begin sending absentee ballots in the mail by Sept. 6, until the appellate court ruling.\n\nFormer independent candidate Kennedy initially fought to get his name on the ballot in North Carolina. In late August, however, he suspended his presidential campaign and endorsed the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump.\n\nTypically, if a candidate drops out of a race with enough time before an election, their name won't get included on the ballot. Kennedy, however, suspended his campaign just before voting begins in North Carolina, creating a too-tight deadline for County Boards of Elections to remove his name without the legal battle that ensued.\n\nKennedy first joined the race as a Democratic candidate, but left the party last fall and chose to run independently. He's technically part of the new We the People Party that was formed earlier this year, and was eventually accepted as an official party by the North Carolina State Board of Elections.\n\nThe North Carolina Democratic Party challenged that board decision, but the challenge was rejected by the Wake County Superior Court. A state judge earlier this month refused to block the printing of Kennedy's name and other We the People Party candidates on North Carolina's presidential ballots.\n\nKennedy suspended his independent campaign in late August and endorsed Trump in the same breath. He said the decision was due to internal polls that showed his presence on the ballot would hurt Republican nominee Trump and benefit Democratic nominee and current Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nPolls at that time did not show that Kennedy would have a significant impact on support for either of the major-party candidates, however.\n\n---> Harris-Trump presidential debate: How to watch on Sept. 10, 2024\n\nNorth Carolina voters who requested an absentee ballot are not required to request a new one if they are to be reprinted, the state board said. Voters who have not yet requested an absentee ballot can still request one anytime before 5 p.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 29.\n\nAbsentee ballots must be received by the appropriate county board office by 7:30 p.m. on Election Day -- Nov. 5, 2024 -- in order to be counted.\n\nThe deadline to register to vote in North Carolina by mail is Oct. 11, 2024. Same-day voter registration is available, however, when voting in person, both on Election Day and during early in-person voting.",

                "body": "WASHINGTON: Bogus stories that immigrants from Haiti are eating neighborhood pets and ducks from public parks in a mid-western US town exploded in public sphere on the eve of the Presidential debate on Tuesday as MAGA activists sought to put Kamala Harris on the back foot on the hot button immigration issue.\n\nSketchy reports and unsubstantiated rumors about grisly excesses by Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, had been circulating on the fringes of social media for days before Donald Trump, Elon Musk and other MAGA principals amplified it this week, adding to an already fervid tirade against illegal immigration.\n\nSpringfield, an Ohio town of around 50,000 people, is reported to have up to 15,000 immigrants under an Immigration Parole Program that gives them temporary protected status. Like with many small communities in the US which have had to host refugees and asylum seekers from across the world, there is an undercurrent of resentment among some locals who have had to share social services and foot the bill for taking care of them.\n\nIn an effort to tap into the resentment and fire up his nativist base, Trump has repeatedly invoked dodgy reports of Venezuelan gangs taking over apartment complexes in Colorado, warning his MAGA flock that soon their homes will be stolen from them. He now has a powerful ally in Musk, who, notwithstanding the fact that he is himself a South African immigrant, amplified several unsubstantiated reports about illegal aliens overrunning the country, eating everything from pet cats to bald eagles, and violently taking over American homes.\n\n\"Mad Max is becoming real fast,\" Musk said on Monday, in response to a post about Venezuelan gangs taking over a hotel in El Paso, Texas, referring to an Australian movie series about social collapse and dystopian future. Musk also argued that unchecked immigration into the US would result in perpetual one-party because immigrants would end up voting for Democrats.\n\nTrump himself has repeatedly talked up another bogus story about American public schools forcibly subjecting children to sex change operations, wildly exaggerating the more accommodating Democratic position on LGBTQ rights. On Monday, his campaign gave credence to the grisly \"Haitians eating cats\" story with a social media post that read: \"President Trump will deport migrants who eat pets. Kamala Harris will send them to your town next. Make your choice, America.\"\n\nTrump's running mate JD Vance posted a video of himself discussing migration to Ohio at a recent hearing, saying, \"Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn't be in this country. Where is our border czar?\"\n\nThe \"Haitians eating cats in Springfield\" rumor appeared to originate in an incident in Canton, Ohio, some 100 kms away, where a woman named Telia Ferrell was arrested for killing a cat. In video footage shared on social media, the police are heard asking her \"Did you eat that cat?\" without any response from the woman, who appears to be in a daze. Ferrell is said to be a US citizen with no links to Haiti.\n\nThe crude exercise of linking Harris to such incidents on the eve of the Presidential debate appear to be aimed at portraying her as a fifth columnist out to destroy America by streaming in millions of immigrants. The right wing echo chamber also circulated an unrelated clip of Harris saying the Biden administration has given Temporary Protection Status (TPS) to 100,000 Haitian migrants, linking it to unsubstantiated reports about pets being abducted for consumption.\n\nDespite officials in Springfield clarifying that \"there have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community,\" Trump and his MAGA associates continue to whip up a frenzy, ostensibly in an effort to move the needle on the 2024 election that polls show the two candidates tied.\n\nAI generated visuals of Trump coddling cats and ducks flooded the MAGA-sphere ahead of the debate on Tuesday. \"Please vote for Trump...so Haitian immigrants don't eat us,\" Republican Senator Ted Cruz said in one post.",

                "body": "Philadelphia (Reuters) -- It is the birthplace of U.S. independence, the \"City of Brotherly Love,\" and the hometown of beloved fictional boxer \"Rocky\" Balboa.\n\nNow Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, will be center stage again when Kamala Harris and Donald Trump meet in a highly anticipated televised debate that could weigh heavily on the November election.\n\nThe two, who have never met in person, will square off at 9 p.m. ET (0100 GMT) for a 90-minute debate hosted by ABC News.\n\nPolice are bracing for protests, with pro-Palestinian groups angry with Harris' continued support of Israel planning to demonstrate. Barricades have been erected around the National Constitution Center, the site of the debate, barring access to the historic area that includes the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall, where the U.S. Constitution was signed.\n\nMeanwhile, several of the city's bars and universities are planning watch parties. Top Democrats will gather at a hotel for a watch party that Harris is expected to attend after the debate ends. Trump's plans after the debate are not yet public.\n\nSome Philadelphia residents said they hoped to learn more about Harris.\n\n\"I wasn't, like, super impressed with her in 2020 when she had the presidential debates and for the primary,\" said Dan Bessler, a Philadelphia resident and sales worker. \"But she is a prosecutor. ... I think she'll be able to hold her own better than Biden was able to at his age.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden's faltering debate performance against Trump in June essentially ended his political career, sparking powerful Democrats to convince him he should step aside ahead and allow Harris, his vice president, to run instead.\n\nSince then, Harris has broken fundraising records and sparked new enthusiasm in the party, but opinion polls suggest a tight race looms with Trump.\n\nWith 19 electoral votes, Pennsylvania is the biggest prize of the basket of battleground states expected to decide the election. Most pundits predict whoever wins Pennsylvania will win the White House.\n\nDemocrats historically win Pennsylvania by running up huge margins in Philadelphia, to offset losses throughout much of the rest of the state.\n\nIn 2020, the city saw its highest turnout since 1984 -- 68% -- but it paled beside the statewide figure of 76.5%.",

For today and the next 55 days, so will everyone else.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will meet Tuesday night for a debate that's so historic and potentially pivotal that it's nearly impossible to fit into one sentence just how unprecedented it is. The presidential nominees are squaring off in what may be their only debate at one of our city's great prides, the National Constitution Center, which overlooks Independence Hall and the birthplace of American democracy.\n\nIt will be a night packed with symbolism, and is just the latest in a string of history-making political events that have taken place here. Both candidates have held rallies in Philadelphia. Their surrogates have effectively camped out in the city and its surrounding counties. Shortly after becoming the unexpected nominee, Harris introduced her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, at Temple University.\n\nAhead of the debate, both sides are mobilizing, underscoring how the campaigns each see opportunities for growth in the city. There are watch parties in and around Philadelphia, and the DNC is blanketing the city with billboards. There's going to be a giant IUD on Independence Mall. Protesters will likely descend, and Mummers are being bused from South Philly bars in full regalia to greet Trump.\n\nAnd the streets will be lined with television news trucks and media from around the world, here to cover the debate that could define the rest of the presidential campaign.\n\nPerhaps this was all expected. Philadelphia is the largest city in arguably the most critical swing state -- a small town of 1.6 million people that has an outsized chip on its shoulder.\n\nFor some city leaders, this debate provides an opportunity to show off the city to a national audience that perhaps only knows Philadelphia for the parts of its reputation they're trying to fix.\n\nAsked about the debate last week, Mayor Cherelle L. Parker, a Democrat, said she wants visitors and viewers to see the city as a modern, working-class city where she's trying to make progress on public safety, cleanliness, and economic opportunity.\n\n\"I'm always talking about 'don't listen to what I say, watch what I do,'\" she said. \"I want people to see who we are. See who we are.\"\n\nWho we are? City Councilmember Isaiah Thomas said simply: \"We make history here.\"\n\n\"We hosted the first Continental Congress and we were the nation's original capital,\" he said. \"We have our own language, culture, food traditions, and swag. We love our sports teams, historic landmarks, our artists, and our neighborhood feel.\"\n\nThe city is, of course, no stranger to presidential politics and the national media circus. It was four years ago in Northeast Philadelphia where former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani famously held a pro-Trump news conference at a landscaping business and sowed doubt about an election that judges across the country said was fair.\n\nAnd it was outside the Convention Center in the heart of Center City where activists on both sides stood for days as election workers counted ballots. Some cheered \"count every vote\" while others jeered \"stop the count.\" Some danced and wore costumes, some played instruments, and some shouted obscenities. Many stayed away -- it was the middle of a pandemic.\n\nThis time around, the national media is catching our city in a good mood. We've largely emerged from the pandemic and the sense of chaos it wrought. Gun violence is way down. On a far more superficial level, but still no doubt weighing on our psyche, the Birds won their season opener, and Kyle Schwarber can't stop hitting homers.\n\nFor this week and until Nov. 5, both campaigns will expend untold resources to try to make inroads in Philly.\n\nTrump's side is hoping to win over more voters of color than he did the last two times he ran for president, and he has made clear he sees opportunity for growth in Philadelphia.\n\nThe former president's supporters in the city say they'll be showing up. There's a pro-Trump motorcade scheduled to traverse the city. Joe Mirarchi, a South Philly resident and a Mummer, worked with other Mummers club leaders to offer a shuttle service from Tankie's Tavern, Brothers Two Lounge, and Big Charlie's Saloon north to the starting point.\n\nThey'll be taking an \"Eagles tailgating bus.\"\n\n\"Anyone who supports President Trump,\" Mirarchi said, \"let's welcome him to Philadelphia.\"\n\nAs for Harris, her campaign is looking to secure critical Pennsylvania in part by driving turnout in the city, where Democrats vastly outnumber Republicans -- but where turnout has sagged in recent elections. Democrats, including Parker, are welcoming Philadelphians to watch parties in Harris' name.\n\n\"Having the debate here spurs interest, and will hopefully increase voter participation,\" said City Councilmember Mark Squilla, a Democrat whose district includes the site of the Constitution Center. \"When Philadelphia has great turnout, a lot of times that decides which direction the state goes in.\"\n\n-------\n\n(Inquirer staff writers Jesse Bunch and Julia Terruso contributed to this article.)",

                "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- Former President Donald Trump said that the biggest challenge in debating Vice President Kamala Harris Tuesday night will be the fact that over the years, she's shifted her positions on so many issues.\n\n\"You don't know what to expect. She's changed all of her policies over the years,\" Trump told NBC News in phone interview Tuesday morning.\n\nHe added, however, that he believes it makes it \"easier\" to define her in the minds of voters.\n\n\"It makes it much easier. She's no longer believable,\" Trump said.\n\nThe debate here Tuesday night, sponsored by ABC, is Trump's second of the 2024 election -- but his first against his new opponent. It's Harris' first general election debate as a presidential candidate ever.\n\nTrump enters debate day feeling -- in his words -- \"great.\" The former president's debate preparations have been far less extensive and structured than what Harris has been doing, but he participated in extensive sessions over the past two days, according to a source familiar.\n\nThree sources who speak to Trump regularly, including one directly involved in the debate prep process, described Trump as either nervous or disengaged with debate preparation in the past few weeks. But that changed as the debate grew closer, and he's been much more dialed in.\n\nThe three sources -- who requested anonymity to describe private conversations with the candidate and his team -- said that he is in a much more focused head space Tuesday than he has been in recent days -- with two suggesting that favorable public polling have helped.\n\nTwo of the sources said that that the Trump strategy will not be to paint Harris as a flip-flopper, but rather to take her most liberal past position and make her own it. One person pointed to comments by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., as a road map. On Sunday, he went on NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" that Harris is a progressive but \"doing what she thinks is right in order to win the election.\"\n\nTrump, too, has frequently shifted his positions over the years, including on issues like abortion and TikTok.\n\nHarris, for her part, will try to \"remind people of what it was like during Donald Trump's years,\" according to a source familiar with her debate strategy.\n\nHer team had unsuccessfully pushed to have the candidates' microphones on the whole time. But even with the microphones muted while the other person is speaking, they're preparing for unscripted and potentially volatile moments -- including the possibility that Trump makes derogatory comments about her, according to sources familiar with her preparations.\n\nThe Harris campaign did not immediately return a request for comment.",

Most polling finds either candidate winning by small margins that fall within the margin of error, indicating they are basically tied.\n\nA New York Times-Sienna College poll released over the weekend showed Trump leading Harris 48-47 among likely voters.

Trump has suggested his campaign will cruise to victory as long as the election has held fairly, a reference to his false claims of fraud from the 2020 election.\n\nPIVOTAL NIGHT FOR BOTH CANDIDATES\n\nWith the race so close and ballots being sent out to voters in some states in the coming weeks, both candidates are looking to make their mark in the race to gain an advantage heading into Election Day.\n\nSo far it is the only debate both candidates have agreed to, meaning that it may be the only time Harris and Trump appear on stage together. A vice presidential debate involving Republican JD Vance and Democrat Tim Walz is scheduled for Oct. 1.\n\nThe debate will offer each of them a sizable audience and their best chance to lay out their case to the American people, primarily undecided voters and independents. Both are expected to show stark contrasts between each other, with Trump framing Harris as an incompetent leader that has fueled the problems with inflation and crisis at the border, while Harris is likely to label the former president a threat to democracy and seek to blame him for the restriction of abortion rights in the wake of Roe v. Wade.\n\nMICS OFF\n\nHarris' campaign lost its adamant push to keep the microphones turned on while it is not a candidate's turn to speak, a continuation of a rule that President Joe Biden was adamant about implementing when he was still the Democratic nominee.\n\nHarris unsuccessfully tried to dare Trump into reversing the muted microphones from the first debate, a move aimed at getting him to get off script and highlight the differences between them.\n\nAnalysts said turning microphones off during the debate with Biden helped Trump, who did not get penalized for interrupting the president or moderators like he did during the 2020 cycle.\n\nTrump's campaign tried to frame the push for hot microphones as Harris trying to lay out an escape route of the debate, though she has remained committed to Tuesday night.\n\nRULES AND HOW TO WATCH\n\nABC will carry the debate live on television and have a stream available online. It will begin at 9 p.m. ET and run for 90 minutes with two commercial breaks.\n\nAnchors David Muir and Linsey Davis will moderate the debate and be the only ones asking questions. Candidates are not allowed to ask each other anything.\n\nThere will be no opening statements, each candidate will get two minutes to answer a question, two minutes to respond to the other and an additional minute for \"follow-ups, clarifications or responses.\"",

                "title": "Debate night comes to Philadelphia, the new center of the political world",
                "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- Philadelphians have always known that our city is the center of the universe. For today and the next 55 days, so will everyone else.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will meet Tuesday night for a debate that's so historic and potentially pivotal that it's nearly impossible to fit into one sentence just how unprecedented it is. The presidential nominees are squaring off in what may be their only debate at one of our city's great prides, the National Constitution Center, which overlooks Independence Hall and the birthplace of American democracy.\n\nIt will be a night packed with symbolism, and is just the latest in a string of history-making political events that have taken place here. Both candidates have held rallies in Philadelphia. Their surrogates have effectively camped out in the city and its surrounding counties. Shortly after becoming the unexpected nominee, Harris introduced her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, at Temple University.\n\nAhead of the debate, both sides are mobilizing, underscoring how the campaigns each see opportunities for growth in the city. There are watch parties in and around Philadelphia, and the DNC is blanketing the city with billboards. There's going to be a giant IUD on Independence Mall. Protesters will likely descend, and Mummers are being bused from South Philly bars in full regalia to greet Trump.\n\nAnd the streets will be lined with television news trucks and media from around the world, here to cover the debate that could define the rest of the presidential campaign.\n\nPerhaps this was all expected. Philadelphia is the largest city in arguably the most critical swing state -- a small town of 1.6 million people that has an outsized chip on its shoulder.\n\nFor some city leaders, this debate provides an opportunity to show off the city to a national audience that perhaps only knows Philadelphia for the parts of its reputation they're trying to fix.\n\nAsked about the debate last week, Mayor Cherelle L. Parker, a Democrat, said she wants visitors and viewers to see the city as a modern, working-class city where she's trying to make progress on public safety, cleanliness, and economic opportunity.\n\n\"I'm always talking about 'don't listen to what I say, watch what I do,'\" she said. \"I want people to see who we are. See who we are.\"\n\nWho we are? City Councilmember Isaiah Thomas said simply: \"We make history here.\"\n\n\"We hosted the first Continental Congress and we were the nation's original capital,\" he said. \"We have our own language, culture, food traditions, and swag. We love our sports teams, historic landmarks, our artists, and our neighborhood feel.\"\n\nThe city is, of course, no stranger to presidential politics and the national media circus. It was four years ago in Northeast Philadelphia where former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani famously held a pro-Trump news conference at a landscaping business and sowed doubt about an election that judges across the country said was fair.\n\nAnd it was outside the Convention Center in the heart of Center City where activists on both sides stood for days as election workers counted ballots. Some cheered \"count every vote\" while others jeered \"stop the count.\" Some danced and wore costumes, some played instruments, and some shouted obscenities. Many stayed away -- it was the middle of a pandemic.\n\nThis time around, the national media is catching our city in a good mood. We've largely emerged from the pandemic and the sense of chaos it wrought. Gun violence is way down. On a far more superficial level, but still no doubt weighing on our psyche, the Birds won their season opener, and Kyle Schwarber can't stop hitting homers.\n\nFor this week and until Nov. 5, both campaigns will expend untold resources to try to make inroads in Philly.\n\nTrump's side is hoping to win over more voters of color than he did the last two times he ran for president, and he has made clear he sees opportunity for growth in Philadelphia.\n\nThe former president's supporters in the city say they'll be showing up. There's a pro-Trump motorcade scheduled to traverse the city. Joe Mirarchi, a South Philly resident and a Mummer, worked with other Mummers club leaders to offer a shuttle service from Tankie's Tavern, Brothers Two Lounge, and Big Charlie's Saloon north to the starting point.\n\nThey'll be taking an \"Eagles tailgating bus.\"\n\n\"Anyone who supports President Trump,\" Mirarchi said, \"let's welcome him to Philadelphia.\"\n\nAs for Harris, her campaign is looking to secure critical Pennsylvania in part by driving turnout in the city, where Democrats vastly outnumber Republicans -- but where turnout has sagged in recent elections. Democrats, including Parker, are welcoming Philadelphians to watch parties in Harris' name.\n\n\"Having the debate here spurs interest, and will hopefully increase voter participation,\" said City Councilmember Mark Squilla, a Democrat whose district includes the site of the Constitution Center. \"When Philadelphia has great turnout, a lot of times that decides which direction the state goes in.\"\n\n-------\n\n(Inquirer staff writers Jesse Bunch and Julia Terruso contributed to this article.)\n\n\u00a92024 The Philadelphia Inquirer, LLC.

                "title": "13 US troops killed during Afghanistan withdrawal to receive Congressional Gold Medals",
                "body": "WASHINGTON - A ceremony on Tuesday will posthumously present Congress' highest honor -- the Congressional Gold Medal -- to 13 U.S. service members who were killed during the chaotic and deadly withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson is hosting the ceremony, which is scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. ET in the Capitol Rotunda. The top Republican and Democratic leaders for both the House and Senate are expected to speak.\n\nThe Congressional Gold Medal is awarded for distinguished achievements and contributions by individuals, institutions, or groups.\n\nThe ceremony comes as the politics of a presidential election swirl around the 2021 withdrawal. Here's what to know:\n\nThe 13 U.S. troops were killed along with more than 170 Afghans in a suicide bombing at Abbey Gate near Kabul's Airport in August 2021.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans supported the legislation to honor the fallen service members, and President Joe Biden signed the legislation in December 2021.\n\nTuesday's ceremony is taking place against the backdrop of a bitter back and forth over who is to blame for the rushed and deadly evacuation from Kabul. Johnson scheduled the ceremony just hours before the first debate between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump.\n\nMost assessments have concluded Trump and Biden share blame for the disastrous end to America's longest war, which saw enemy Taliban take over Afghanistan again before the last American troops even flew out of the Kabul airport.\n\nThe Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) - the main U.S. government watchdog for the war - pointed to Trump's 2020 deal with the Taliban to withdraw all U.S. forces and military contractors as \"the single most important factor\" in the collapse of U.S.-allied Afghan security forces and Taliban takeover, followed by Biden's April 2021 announcement that he would proceed with the withdrawal.\n\nOn Sunday, House Republicans released a scathing investigation into the withdrawal that cast blame on Biden's administration and minimized the role of Trump, who had signed the withdrawal deal with the Taliban.\n\nJohnson, a Louisiana Republican, praised the recently-published House report that blames Biden's administration and was led by the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Republican Rep. Michael McCaul.\n\n\"We must not allow the Biden-Harris Administration to rewrite history,\" Johnson said in a statement. \"The families of the 13 fallen servicemembers and the allies we abandoned in Afghanistan deserve better.\"\n\nWhite House national security spokesman John Kirby on Monday criticized the House report as partisan and one-sided, and said it revealed little new information as well as several inaccuracies. He noted that evacuation plans had started well before the pullout and the U.S. did not hand over equipment to the Taliban. He said the fall of Kabul \"moved a lot faster than anyone could have anticipated.\"\n\nHe also acknowledged that during the evacuation \"not everything went according to plan. Nothing ever does.\"\n\n\"We hold ourselves all accountable for that,\" he said of the deaths.\n\nTrump has put the Afghan withdrawal, with the backing of some of the families of the Americans killed, into the center of his campaign. Last month, his political team distributed video of him attending a wreath-laying ceremony for the fallen service members at Arlington National Cemetery on the third anniversary of the bombing, despite the cemetery's prohibition on partisan activity on the grounds as well as an altercation with a cemetery employee who was trying to make sure the campaign followed those rules.\n\nThe Gold Star military families who invited him to the Arlington ceremony have defended Trump's actions. At a news conference outside the Capitol on Monday, they implored for the House report to be taken seriously and demanded accountability for those in leadership during the evacuation from Kabul.\n\n\"President Trump is certainly not perfect. But he's a far better choice, in my opinion, than the mess that Biden and Harris have created since Kabul,\" said Paula Knauss Selph, whose son Ryan Knauss died in the Abbey Gate attack.\n\nWhile Trump and Republicans have sought to link Harris to the withdrawal as a campaign issue, and Harris has said she was the last person in the room when Biden made his decision, neither watchdog reviews nor the 18-month investigation by House Republicans have identified any instance where the vice president had a significant impact on decision-making.\n\nStill, House Republicans argued that Harris, as well as Biden's national security team, needed to face accountability for the consequences of the deadly withdrawal.\n\n\"Kamala Harris wants to be the president of the United States. She wants to be commander in chief. She needs to answer for this report immediately,\" said Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican on the committee.\n\nMcCaul, the chairman, also defended the timing of the report by saying that the committee's investigation had to overcome resistance from the Biden administration.\n\nThe top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, also issued a memorandum in response to the GOP report, saying he was concerned by the \"attempts to politicize the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.\"\n\n\"Republicans' partisan attempts to garner headlines rather than acknowledge the full facts and substance of their investigation have only increased with the heat of an election season,\" Meeks said.\n\nLater this month, Congressional Gold Medals will also be awarded to the NASA mathematicians known as the \"Hidden Figures\" who played a significant role in astronaut John Glenn's launch into orbit.\n\nRecipients of the prestigious awards are Katherine Johnson in recognition of her service to the U.S. as a mathematician, Dr. Christine Darden for her service as an aeronautical engineer to the U.S., and Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson in recognition of their service to the nation during the space race.\n\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson will represent the agency during a Congressional Gold Medal ceremony at 3 p.m. ET on Sept. 18 at the Emancipation Hall in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.\n\nBillie Jean King, the tennis Hall of Famer and outspoken activist for women's equal rights in sports, could also be awarded a Congressional Gold Medal - becoming the first individual female athlete to receive the prestigious award.\n\nReps. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey said last week that they have enough votes in the House to grant her the distinguished award. The only step left was to get the bill to the floor for a vote. The companion bill in the Senate passed unanimously.\n\nLawmakers introduced the bill in September 2023 on the 50th anniversary of King's victory over Bobby Riggs in the \"Battle of the Sexes,\" still the most-watched tennis match of all-time. That same year, King led the successful push for the U.S. Open to award equal prize money to its men's and women's champions, and the WTA Tour was created.\n\nBaseball players Jackie Robinson and Roberto Clemente, and golfers Jack Nicklaus, Byron Nelson and Arnold Palmer are among some of the athlete recipients.",

                "body": "BOSTON (WHDH) - A new presidential debate is bringing with it a new rival for former President Donald Trump Tuesday.\n\nBut as he gets set to take the stage in Philadelphia, Trump is leaning on a familiar playbook for preparations, meeting with senior advisors and policy experts.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is taking a different approach, holding mock debates and seeking advice from people who have sparred with Trump before.\n\nOn the eve of the debate, 7NEWS spoke with Emerson College pollster Spencer Kimball, who said the stakes in this debate may be especially high for Harris, since she is more of an unknown candidate than Trump.\n\n\"Voters are going to look at everything she says and how she acts and walk away with their impression of her,\" Kimball said Monday night. \"And that's going to be very costly.\"\n\n\"If she has a great night, she has a chance to win over some voters,\" Kimball said. \"If she has a poor night, there's a chance that they slip away.\"\n\nTrump was on the debate stage in June when he faced President Joe Biden. The debate sparked weeks of concern and ultimately prompted Biden to end his re-election campaign.\n\nBiden endorsed Harris as his replacement atop the Democratic ticket.\n\nAfter Harris secured the Democratic nomination, named Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, and rallied her party at the Democratic National Convention, attention quickly turned to a debate with Trump.\n\nRepresentatives from both campaigns reportedly sparred over rules for the debate before settling on a similar slate of rules to those used in the June debate.\n\nEach candidate will be allowed two minutes to answer questions. Microphones will only be live for the candidate whose turn it is to speak. And candidate will not be allowed to bring prewritten notes on stage.\n\nThere will be no live audience.\n\nWith the first early ballots in the general election set to go to voters hours before the debate, Kimball said the challenge for both Harris and Trump will be to define the presidential race in ways that favor their respective bids for the White House.\n\n\"Is it about immigration? Is it about the economy? Is it about threats to democracy?\" he said. \"That's what I think both candidates are going to wrestle up against on Tuesday night -- defining what this campaign is for the voters.\"\n\nBeyond Tuesday, there are no further presidential debates currently scheduled.\n\nThe vice presidential debate between Walz and Sen. JD Vance of Ohio is set for Oct. 1.\n\nTuesday's ABC News Presidential Debate is scheduled to begin at 9 p.m. 7NEWS will have a simulcast of the debate.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 Sunbeam Television.

                "body": "(PHILADELPHIA) -- Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump square off Tuesday at what could be their only presidential debate, setting high stakes for an event expected to be viewed by millions of Americans and a key sliver of undecided voters.\n\nHarris' momentum -- after her unusual rise as the Democrats' nominee shot her into a neck-and-neck race -- has now stalled, making the head-to-head matchup an opportunity to get that started again if she can adequately make the argument for her own candidacy and cast Trump as unfit for another term.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has struggled to find a way to consistently and effectively attack his new opponent but has remained highly competitive, thanks to a large base of immovable supporters and the broad swath of Americans who already have fixed views of him. Tuesday's debate offers him an opportunity to solidify his support while painting Harris in a negative light to an electorate that has less cemented perceptions of her.\n\nThe ABC News debate, moderated by David Muir and Linsey Davis, will take place on Tuesday, Sept. 10 at 9 p.m ET. A prime-time pre-debate special will air at 8 p.m. ET. It will air on ABC and stream on ABC News Live, Disney+ and Hulu. Viewers can also stream the debate on the ABC app on a smartphone or tablet, on ABC.com and connected devices.\n\nTrump has worked to peg Harris as a \"California liberal,\" letting voters' perceptions of the progressive bastion paint a picture of a candidate who served as the state's attorney general and junior senator. He's also hammered her on immigration and inflation -- two voter concerns on which polls suggest he has an edge.\n\nHowever, he's also veered into personal remarks, including falsely questioning Harris' racial identity (she's Black and south Asian), touting what he says are his superior good looks and promoting vulgar and false allegations that past romantic relationships of Harris' helped propel her political career.\n\nStaying on message on his four-year economic record, which saw low inflation before the pandemic and less fervor over unauthorized border crossings, is key, allies told ABC News.\n\nVeering into personal attacks would be counterproductive, they argued, drawing media attention away from what they view as a favorable policy issue set.\n\n\"I think he does,\" former White House press secretary Sean Spicer said when asked if Trump makes an effective contrast on the trail. \"If I had a critique, it would be that he'll make the case sometimes and then, with all due respect, he will sometimes go beyond the case and give the media something else to focus on.\"\n\n\"He needs to avoid creating a moment that takes the focus away from her record. So, if it's about her personality or her appearance as opposed to her record, that will change the focus of what people talk about the next day,\" Spicer said.\n\nHow does Harris introduce herself to undecided voters?\n\nWhile Trump comes in with nearly universal name recognition, 28% of likely voters in a recent New York Times/Siena College poll said they feel they \"need to learn more about Kamala Harris.\" That means that while many voters have heard of Harris, she is less defined than Trump in their eyes and thus has more work to do to introduce herself -- lest she be defined by her opposition.\n\nHarris has dual goals in Tuesday's debate: make the case for herself as someone who would be a capable president and get under Trump's skin to spark a reaction to suggest he isn't worthy of another four years in the White House.\n\n\"I think there needs to be a long litany of just pummeling Donald Trump while also being extremely clear about what your vision is for the future,\" said Bakari Sellers, a prominent Harris ally and Democratic media commentator.\n\nHarris on the trail has sought to do both.\n\nMonday, she fleshed out her policy proposals in a new page on her website, her most expansive explanation yet of her platform. And in early stump speeches, she boasted of her time working as a prosecutor and state attorney general combating gangs and other criminal activity, saying to crowds that she knows \"Donald Trump's type,\" in a clear reference to his legal travails.\n\nThe way she balances those two dictates could offer clues as to the way she and her campaign best think she can march to victory in November.\n\nWill there be any hot mics?\n\nHarris had a memorable debate performance in 2020, when she faced off against then-Vice President Mike Pence. Pence was muscling in on her answers, allowing her to declare, \"I'm speaking,\" in one of the more viral instances of the night.\n\nIt's unclear whether she'll be able to replicate such a moment.\n\nThe candidates' microphones will be muted while their opponent is answering a question, something Harris' team argued against in the hopes of tempting Trump to aggressively interrupt her and come off as unpresidential.\n\nIn an election in which policy is largely taking a backseat to personality, producing such a clash might possibly spark one of the debate's most notable moments.\n\nHow big of a role will President Joe Biden play?\n\nHarris has been walking a tightrope since the start of her campaign between recognizing her role in Biden's administration and touting its achievements while also casting herself as a candidate in her own right, particularly after the unusual way in which she became her party's nominee.\n\nA recent New York Times/Siena College poll showed that roughly 61% of likely voters said the next president should represent a major change from Biden. Only 25% of them said Harris represented that change, compared to 53% who said Trump did.\n\nHarris so far has appeared mostly on the campaign trail by herself, and in a joint appearance in Pittsburgh and at Democrats' convention last month, Biden spoke first before handing the stage off to Harris, underscoring her role in the electoral spotlight.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has at times focused extensively on Biden, particularly in the days and weeks after the president ended his campaign and handed the reins to Harris.\n\nSuch a strategy risks focusing too much on Biden rather than Trump's own opponent -- but, allies said, tying Harris to voter disapproval of the way the current president has handled the economy and inflation could be a boon.\n\n\"For him to be viewed as having a successful debate, he has to continue that assault,\" said one former campaign aide in touch with Trump's current team. \"She's the vice president United States seeking the second term of Joe Biden. We can make that case.\"\n\nIs there a major moment that moves the electoral needle?\n\nThe last debate between Biden and Trump was clearly consequential -- it ended the former's campaign. That doesn't mean Tuesday's debate will pack the same punch.\n\nSurely, millions will tune in to the latest salvo in a race packed with unpredictable twists and turns, raising the stakes. But many debates make little more than ripples in presidential races -- an outcome that might benefit neither candidate.\n\nAs it stands, it's a neck-and-neck race. Harris would like a moment that revives her momentum, which jolted her into contention but now is stalled; Trump would like a moment to erase some of the gains Harris has made and actually reverse her improved poll numbers.",

                "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- Tuesday has arrived, and with it, a crucial chance for both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump to make their case to voters on stage in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nParty operatives and campaign officials who spoke with the Washington Examiner outlined strategies for each candidate on how to emerge successful from Tuesday's debate.\n\nHarris, who saw a huge polling boost after replacing President Joe Biden atop the Democratic ticket in July, has failed to expand her lead over Trump since August and is seeking momentum heading into Election Day.\n\nTrump is looking to the debate as a chance to \"reset his campaign\" and finally \"draw the lines of distinction against Harris,\" according to Louis Perron, a PhD global political consultant and the author of \"Beat the Incumbent: Proven Strategies and Tactics to Win Elections.\"\n\n\"Don't accuse her for something ridiculous like her laughter. Tie her to the incumbent administration and key unpopular decisions,\" he told the Washington Examiner. \"And he needs to do it in a calm, settled manner. In style, like in the last debate against Biden.\"\n\nHarris, on the other hand, must appear both presidential -- an admittedly cliche response but something she has been attempting to channel since at least the convention with her wardrobe choices and speech tenor -- and not be afraid to \"get in the mud\" with Trump, according to three veteran Democratic strategists with close ties to her 2024 campaign.\n\n\"You heard it from Michelle Obama herself at the convention. We're done with that 'when they go low' stuff. Trump hasn't seen anyone try to match his vitriol on stage at a debate, something that just given her age alone, Vice President Harris is much better equipped to do than President Biden,\" one Democratic strategist told the Washington Examiner, suggesting that Harris has learned lessons from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's failed 2016 campaign against Trump. \"The gloves are coming off.\"\n\n\"Voters know just who Donald Trump is. His many flaws and crimes have been documented non-stop for the past eight years, and I'd like to see the vice president detail her plan for the number one issue this cycle: the economy,\" a second Democratic strategist explained. \"The Trump campaign has criticized her nonstop failing to produce a complete policy platform. Well, this is the time to do it. Take away their only real talking point to date.\"\n\nPennsylvania voters themselves gave similar responses to the Washington Examiner in recent days.\n\nEmily Pugliese, a 43-year-old Philadelphia resident and policy expert at an environmental nonprofit organization, suggested that Harris can make the \"bumbling fool\" Trump \"implode\" by simply being herself, and \"speaking clearly and concisely, which she's excellent at doing.\"\n\nPugliese also claimed that Harris will \"absolutely\" get under Trump's skin by calling him a convicted felon, adding it's \"just the truth.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nKassel Coover, a 42-year-old marketing professional from Chester County, wants to see Harris hit \"hard on the economy.\"\n\n\"Even though the jobs reports say that the economy is doing well, you know, from where I am, there are a lot of people out of work, and we need to know that job creation is going to pick up,\" Coover stated in an interview on the outskirts of a Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff event on Sunday.\n\nCaroline Bradley, a 46-year-old marketing professional and friend of Coover, added that Harris doesn't think \"she needs to be ladylike and quiet\" in countering Trump's bravado on stage.\n\n\"I think that she needs to label him as the old man that he is. Every single time he goes against her, saying some baloney because he doesn't know anything, and he lies a lot 'well, old man Trump over there, you know, just like grandpa,'\" she stated. \"He's been campaigning as being the young guy. She needs to flip it.\"\n\nTrump supporters want to see the former president \"tell the truth\" and draw contrasts between his policies in office and those of the Biden-Harris administration.\n\n\"He wants to be everybody's president. He has something to run on and Harris doesn't have anything to run on. That's the problem,\" David Gehring, a 37-year-old Trump Force 47 volunteer from the Pittsburgh suburbs, said of Trump. \"We have someone running for president right now that has been in there for four years and is not running on her success. She's running on what she's going to do to change things. Ma'am, you're in office today. Get to work. You're there now. Bring down inflation now.\"\n\n\"Speak to what he has done that no one can dispute. Speak to the uncovering that has occurred on the legal maneuvering on the other side, he's smart,\" added Carolyn Dorazio, a business attorney and Trump Force 47 volunteer also from the Pittsburgh suburbs, added. \"Speak to the facts. When she says 'you're a convicted felon,' well no, part of the basis of that frivolous lawsuit, as attorneys will know that term. They were all frivolous. They just filed them and got away with it because they had judges that didn't care. They were politicizing the process.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nAnd it would appear that even Trump fans are concerned that the former president's past \"nasty woman\" tactics might backfire on the former president. Asked if he wants to see Trump continue his name-calling on stage, Gehring conceded that the campaign \"can do with a little bit less of that.\"\n\n\"He has so much to run on. He has so much that he's done,\" he explained. \"There have been some really great results. I wish he would do a little bit less of that, perhaps.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE",

                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Speaker Mike Johnson is hosting a ceremony Tuesday to posthumously present Congress' highest honor -- the Congressional Gold Medal -- to 13 U.S. service members who were killed during the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, even as the politics of a presidential election swirl around the event.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans supported the legislation to honor the 13 U.S. troops, who were killed along with more than 170 Afghans in a suicide bombing at Abbey Gate near Kabul's Airport in August 2021. President Joe Biden signed the legislation in December 2021. The top Republican and Democratic leaders for both the House and Senate are expected to speak at Tuesday's ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda.\n\nThe event is taking place against the backdrop of a bitter back and forth over who is to blame for the rushed and deadly evacuation from Kabul. Johnson scheduled the ceremony just hours before the first debate between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump.\n\nHouse Republicans also released a scathing investigation on Sunday into the withdrawal that cast blame on Biden's administration and minimized the role of Trump, who had signed the withdrawal deal with the Taliban.\n\nJohnson, a Louisiana Republican and Trump ally, praised the House report, which was led by the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Republican Rep. Michael McCaul.\n\n\"We must not allow the Biden-Harris Administration to rewrite history,\" Johnson said in a statement. \"The families of the 13 fallen servicemembers and the allies we abandoned in Afghanistan deserve better.\"\n\nWhite House national security spokesman John Kirby on Monday criticized the House report as partisan and one-sided, and said it revealed little new information as well as several inaccuracies. He noted that evacuation plans had started well before the pullout and the U.S. did not hand over equipment to the Taliban. He said the fall of Kabul \"moved a lot faster than anyone could have anticipated.\"\n\nHe also acknowledged that during the evacuation \"not everything went according to plan. Nothing ever does.\"\n\n\"We hold ourselves all accountable for that,\" he said of the deaths.\n\nKirby added there would be \"quite a few\" people from the Department of Defense at the ceremony Tuesday.\n\nThe top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, also issued a memorandum in response to the GOP report, saying he was concerned by the \"attempts to politicize the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.\"\n\n\"Republicans' partisan attempts to garner headlines rather than acknowledge the full facts and substance of their investigation have only increased with the heat of an election season,\" Meeks said.\n\nPentagon reviews have concluded that the suicide bombing was not preventable, and that suggestions troops may have seen the would-be bomber were not true.\n\nRegardless, Trump has thrust the withdrawal, with the backing from some of the families of the Americans killed, into the center of his campaign. Last month, his political team distributed video of him attending a wreath-laying ceremony for the fallen service members at Arlington National Cemetery on the third anniversary of the bombing, despite the cemetery's prohibition on partisan activity on the grounds as well as an altercation with a cemetery employee who was trying to make sure the campaign followed those rules.\n\nThe Gold Star military families who invited him to the Arlington ceremony have defended Trump's actions. At a fiery news conference outside the Capitol Monday, they implored for the House report to be taken seriously and demanded accountability for those in leadership during evacuation from Kabul.\n\n\"President Trump is certainly not perfect. But he's a far better choice, in my opinion, than the mess that Biden and Harris have created since Kabul,\" said Paula Knauss Selph, whose son Ryan Knauss died in the Abbey Gate attack.\n\nWhile Trump and Republicans have sought to link Harris to the withdrawal as a campaign issue, and Harris has said she was the last person in the room when Biden made his decision, neither watchdog reviews nor the 18-month investigation by House Republicans have identified any instance where the vice president had a significant impact on decision-making.\n\nStill, House Republicans argued that Harris, as well as Biden's national security team, needed to face accountability for the consequences of the deadly withdrawal.\n\n\"Kamala Harris wants to be the president of the United States. She wants to be commander in chief. She needs to answer for this report immediately,\" said Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican on the committee.\n\nMcCaul, the chairman, also defended the timing of the report by saying that the committee's investigation had to overcome resistance from the Biden administration.\n\nHe cast the investigation as a \"truth-seeking mission\" rather than a partisan endeavor, but also bragged that out of all the investigations that House Republicans have launched into the Biden administration in the last two years \"this investigation is the one they fear the most.\"\n\nMost assessments have concluded Trump and Biden share blame for the disastrous end to America's longest war, which saw enemy Taliban take over Afghanistan again before the last American troops even flew out of the Kabul airport. The main U.S. government watchdog for the war points to Trump's 2020 deal with the Taliban to withdraw all U.S. forces and military contractors as \"the single most important factor\" in the collapse of U.S.-allied Afghan security forces and Taliban takeover.\n\nBiden's April 2021 announcement that he would proceed with the withdrawal set in motion by Trump was the second-biggest factor, the watchdog said.\n\nBoth Trump and Biden kept up the staged withdrawal of U.S. forces, and in Trump's case sharply cut back important U.S. airstrikes in the Taliban, even though the Taliban failed to enter into substantive negotiations with the U.S.-backed civilian government as required by Trump's withdrawal deal.",

                "body": "CHICAGO (AP) -- For Christopher Pugh, the 2020 election was a turning point.\n\nHe already distrusted the government. But as he watched Fox News coverage in the immediate aftermath of the election and read posts on Twitter, the social media platform now known as X, that distrust grew. He now believes the falsehood that the 2020 election was stolen and trusts few people other than former President Donald Trump to deliver him news about election results.\n\n\"I trust Donald Trump, not the government,\" said the 38-year-old Republican from Gulfport, Mississippi. \"That's it.\"\n\nWhile most Americans trust government-certified election results at least a \"moderate\" amount, Republicans are more likely to trust Trump and his campaign, according to a new survey from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and USAFacts. Americans also are heading into the November election with concerns about misinformation. Many have low trust that the information they receive from presidential candidates -- particularly Trump, but also Vice President Kamala Harris -- is based on factual information.\n\nTrump continues to lie about the outcome of the 2020 election, saying it was rigged against him even after dozens of his court challenges failed, reviews, recounts and audits in battleground states all affirmed President Joe Biden's win, and Trump's own attorney general said there was no evidence of widespread fraud. Despite no evidence of any widespread fraud, a 2023 poll found that most Republicans believe Biden was not legitimately elected president.\n\nAs Trump runs as the Republican candidate for the third time, he also is signaling that he can only lose through widespread fraud. Over the weekend he threatened to prosecute those \"involved in unscrupulous behavior\" this election should he win in November.\n\n\"The only way they can beat us is to cheat,\" Trump said at a Las Vegas rally in June.\n\nThe recent findings from the AP-NORC survey show that a significant chunk of Trump's supporters might be more inclined to believe what he says about the upcoming election results than they are to trust government certifications of election results.\n\nAbout two-thirds of Republicans trust Trump's campaign at least a moderate amount to provide accurate information about the results of the 2024 election, while only about half say the same about the official certifications of results, the survey found. By contrast, about 9 in 10 Democrats trust the government certification at least a moderate amount, and an overwhelming majority, 82%, also have at least a moderate amount of trust in Harris and her campaign.\n\nMost Americans -- around 7 in 10 -- trust the government certifications of election results at least a moderate amount, according to the survey. Majorities also trust national and local TV news networks, as well as local or national newspapers, to provide accurate information about the outcome of this year's presidential election.\n\nDanielle Almeida, a 45-year-old Democrat from Briarcliff Manor, New York, said she trusts government-certified election results and finds it alarming that some Americans don't.\n\n\"In order to have a democracy, we have to trust the system and the results of our elections,\" she said, adding that she thinks Trump \"does not care about fact-checking because he believes his supporters don't care, either.\"\n\nAmericans are less likely to trust the campaigns overall -- compared to sources such as the government and the media -- but they have a higher level of trust in Harris and her campaign than in Trump and his campaign to provide accurate information about the outcome of the election. About half have at least a \"moderate\" amount of trust in Harris and her campaign. By contrast, about 4 in 10 have at least a moderate amount of trust in Trump and his campaign.\n\nSome Republicans' distrust of election results started far before the 2020 election.\n\nRichard Baum, 60, a conservative independent from Odessa, Texas, said his suspicions began in the 2000 U.S. presidential race between George W. Bush and Al Gore. After Bush won by a slim margin, \"hanging chads\" became an unlikely symbol of a disputed presidential election as small anomalies common in elections ballooned into major national controversies.\n\n\"There was some stuff there that didn't seem right that made a lot of doubts in my mind about if you can trust the government,\" Baum said.\n\nBaum said he would trust election results only if voting took place on only a single day, early voting and mail-in ballots were banned and photo IDs were required at all polling places.\n\nMany Americans doubt the veracity of both presidential candidates' campaign messages, but skepticism about Trump's campaign is higher, the USAFacts/AP-NORC survey found.\n\nAbout 6 in 10 Americans believe that Trump's campaign messages are \"rarely\" or \"never\" based on factual information, compared to 45% who say that about Harris' campaign messages.\n\nMany Americans also say it's hard to discern fact from fiction when it comes to the candidates. Slightly less than half of Americans say it's \"very easy\" or \"somewhat easy\" to find factual information about the candidates and their positions, and only about one-third say it's easy to know if what candidates are saying is true or not.\n\nAbout 6 in 10 Americans say it's easy for them to understand the difference between fact and opinion when it comes to information about the upcoming presidential election, but only about 4 in 10 say it's easy to know whether information is true or not.\n\nAmericans are, however, more confident about factual information related to election logistics: About 7 in 10 Americans say it's easy to find information about how to register to vote, and about 6 in 10 say it's easy to find information about how to cast their ballot.\n\nMichele Martin, a 56-year-old Pennsylvania Democrat, said she is \"very concerned\" about misinformation from politicians but finds it much easier to access basic voter information.\n\n\"It's online. It's mailed to you. It's not hard to find,\" she said.\n\nAbout 8 in 10 Americans say that when it comes to getting information about the government, the spread of misinformation is a \"major problem.\" That is essentially unchanged from when the question was asked in 2020.\n\nLisa Kuda, a 57-year-old Republican from Palm Harbor, Florida, said she gets most of her news from social media and friends. She said she feels alienated from most news sources other than Fox News.\n\n\"Misinformation is everywhere,\" she said. \"It's really difficult to find information about candidates.\"\n\nWhen Americans see news about the election and want to find out whether it's true, 40% say they turn to an internet search first. Much smaller shares -- around 1 in 10 for each -- say they first check cable news, national TV news or social media.\n\nBaum, from Texas, said he finds it difficult to easily access information about candidates because he believes social media platforms \"are censoring conservative ideologies.\" He also doesn't trust Google and instead turns to conservative networks and podcasts such One America News and conservative podcasters to fact-check claims he's unsure about.\n\nAlmeida's process looks much different. She starts with a Google search and wades through multiple articles from news outlets such as The New York Times and NBC News, making note of any differences. If multiple articles have the same information, she said, she's more likely to trust it.\n\n\"Misinformation is a huge problem,\" she said. \"You have to take time to do your research.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Ali Swenson in New York contributed to this report.

                "body": "WASHINGTON -- Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris will meet in a highly anticipated and potentially consequential debate Tuesday night in Philadelphia -- just over two months after President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance precipitated his exit from the race.\n\nThe debate, to be hosted by ABC News, is set for 9 p.m. Eastern and will be the first time Trump and Harris will meet in person, according to Harris. Viewers can livestream the debate on ABC.com or on the platforms ABC News Live, Disney+ and Hulu. The debate will also be simulcast on C-SPAN.\n\nThe event is the only scheduled televised exchange between the candidates before Election Day in November, though early voting kicks off in the battleground state of Pennsylvania Sept. 16 and in four other states later this month.\n\n'We'll be ready'\n\nTrump surrogates on Monday said the former president plans to challenge Harris on views she's changed over the years, including on fracking and immigration.\n\n\"We'll be ready tomorrow, President Trump will be ready. The question is will Kamala Harris be ready because she's gonna have a lot of things to defend,\" Jason Miller, Trump campaign senior adviser, said on a call organized by the Republican National Committee that also featured Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida and former Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, a Democratic Party defector who has endorsed Trump.\n\n\"You can't prepare for President Trump. There's just no way to do it,\" Miller later added.\n\nTrump will also seek to tie Harris to all decisions made under the Biden administration. Gaetz dubbed her \"co-president\" and alleged on the call that Harris is \"in charge of the entire administration.\"\n\nRepublicans are using the narrative to blame Harris for the 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in which 13 service members died.\n\nThe GOP-led House Committee on Foreign Affairs released a 353-page report Monday blaming the deadly conclusion of the two-decade U.S. war in Afghanistan squarely on the Biden-Harris administration. Harris' last name is mentioned 285 times in the report.\n\n\"Kamala Harris is unfit to be our president and commander-in-chief,\" Gabbard said on the call.\n\nRetired U.S. military leaders issued a letter defending Harris' fitness to lead the country, and blaming Trump's \"chaotic approach\" to negotiating with the Taliban before leaving office.\n\n\"He repeatedly fails to take responsibility for his own role in putting service members in harm's way,\" the former generals wrote on behalf of the veterans' advocacy group National Security Leaders for America.\n\nTrump attracted his own attention related to the Afghanistan withdrawal when his campaign staffers confronted an Arlington National Cemetery official on Aug. 26, the third anniversary of the 13 service members' deaths. The incident was first reported by NPR.\n\nTrump has denied his staffers pushed the cemetery official aside in order to take photos in a restricted area, but the U.S. Army confirmed the incident.\n\n'Go to Bat 4 Harris'\n\nThe vice president prepped for the debate in a Pittsburgh hotel over the weekend before traveling across the swing state Monday for the following night's prime-time event.\n\nThe Harris campaign began the week by releasing an ad Monday featuring several former Trump administration officials, including former Vice President Mike Pence and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, who have spoken out against a second Trump presidency.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee flew a banner Monday above Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia ahead of the division-leading Phillies' home game against the Tampa Bay Rays. The banner read: \"Don't Strikeout W/Trump Go to Bat 4 Harris.\"\n\nAfter roughly 50 days into her campaign and just 56 days until the election, Harris released her policy platform one day ahead of the debate. The four-pillar plan includes promises to lower taxes on the middle class and build affordable housing, protect reproductive freedoms and civil rights, secure the border and address gun violence, and \"stand up to dictators\" and support veterans.\n\nHarris also vowed to support an ethics code for the U.S. Supreme Court, and to \"ensure that no former president has immunity for crimes committed while in the White House\" -- a reference to the high court's July ruling that granted former presidents immunity for core official acts and presumptive immunity for \"outer perimeter\" duties, but none for personal actions.\n\nThe Trump campaign accused Harris' platform of \"dishonesty\" in a campaign email sent Monday. \"We know the results of her policies: chaos, devastation and destruction.\"\n\nTrump and the Republican party released a platform in July that centered on 20 core promises which swore to \"seal the border,\" \"carry out the largest deportation operation in American history,\" and \"end inflation,\" among others.\n\nWhen asked by reporters Saturday in Pittsburgh's Strip District market area if she was ready to debate Trump, the former California prosecutor and U.S. senator answered, \"Yes, I am. Yes.\"\n\nWhat's the main message she wants to tell Trump on the debate stage?\n\n\"There is a lot,\" Harris said in response to the question.\n\n\"But look, it's time to turn the page on the divisiveness. It's time to bring our country together to chart a new way forward,\" she said.\n\nTrump's legal issues ahead of debate\n\nWhile Harris hunkered down for debate prep, Trump has been focusing in recent days on his myriad legal issues and hosting long-winded appearances.\n\nOn Saturday the former president held court for nearly two hours at a campaign rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin, and repeated a debunked claim that Venezuelan gang members had overtaken an Aurora, Colorado, apartment building. He told the crowd that removing Venezuelan immigrants from the state will \"be a bloody story.\"\n\nHe also downplayed his New York state conviction as a \"witch hunt,\" as he has several times before.\n\nTrump, the only former president to become a convicted felon, learned Friday that a Manhattan judge delayed his sentencing until after the November election. Trump was convicted in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to a porn star ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTrump also spoke for nearly an hour Friday at Trump Tower during what was billed as a press conference but included no questions. The appearance followed oral arguments in his appeal of a civil trial verdict in which he was found liable of sexual abuse and defamation of writer E. Jean Carroll.\n\nOn Thursday his lawyers pleaded not guilty on his behalf in federal court to a renewed indictment alleging he co-conspired to subvert the 2020 presidential results. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan set a pre-trial schedule that includes deadlines both before and after November's election.\n\nThe vice presidential debate between Ohio U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is scheduled to be hosted by CBS News in New York City on Oct. 1.",

As Donald Trump vies for another term in the White House, the country is abuzz with speculation over how life might look with the ex-president back at the helm.\n\nHere are Trump's plans for the United States and the world, in five emblematic measures.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris's rival in November's election has pledged to launch the biggest deportation operation of illegal migrants in US history on his first day in office.\n\n\"We're going to get them out as fast as we can,\" he has said, accusing undocumented migrants of \"poisoning the blood of our country.\"\n\nThe 78-year-old, known for his unfinished US-Mexico border wall project, has said he would be happy to \"use the military\" as part of the effort and would open detention camps to process targets for expulsion.\n\n\"On day one of my new term in office, I will sign an executive order making clear to federal agencies that under the correct interpretation of the law, going forward the future children of illegal aliens will not receive automatic US citizenship,\" he said in a campaign video.\n\nHe has confirmed he also plans to reinstate his ban on entries from several Muslim-majority countries, as a means of \"keeping terrorists the hell out of our country.\"\n\nTrump slammed the door on the 2015 Paris climate accords during his first term, and his campaign has said he intends to end US participation again if reelected.\n\nHe told supporters at a rally earlier in the summer that he would \"stop Biden's wasteful spending and rapidly terminate the green new scam\" -- a reference to the funding committed by his successor to mitigating climate change.\n\n\"I will repeal crooked Joe Biden's insane electric vehicle mandate and we will 'drill, baby, drill,'\" Trump said in Wisconsin, using an old Republican slogan.\n\n\"Energy costs will come down very quickly,\" he vowed. \"In many cases we'll be cutting your energy costs in half.\"\n\nTrump has pledged to make the United States the \"Bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world,\" and to put tech billionaire and right-wing conspiracy theorist Elon Musk in charge of a wide-ranging audit of governmental waste.\n\nTrump also envisages tariffs of \"more than 10%\" on all imports. US companies -- and eventually their customers -- pay for import tariffs, not the companies exporting the goods.\n\nHe insists that the revenue collected will finance a \"middle class, upper class, lower class, business class big tax cut.\"\n\nHaving waged a fierce trade war with China during his first term, he also plans to revoke the Asian giant's \"most favoured nation\" status, granted to promote trade.\n\nTrump never misses an opportunity to point out that it is partly thanks to him -- and his three conservative Supreme Court appointments -- that abortion rights have been considerably weakened in the United States.\n\nBut he is more ambiguous about the future of access to reproductive health care.\n\nInsisting it should be an issue for the individual states, the Republican has balked at pushing a nationwide abortion ban, a commitment that would win him support from the religious right.\n\n\"You must follow your heart on this issue but remember, you must also win elections,\" he has said.\n\nAnd he promised: \"My Administration will be great for women and their reproductive rights.\"\n\nTrump has been saying for months he could end the war in Ukraine within \"24 hours,\" without explaining how.\n\nCritics suggest his plan would involve pressuring Kyiv to cede territory illegally occupied by Russia in both 2014 and 2022.\n\n\"I have a very exacting plan how to stop Ukraine and Russia, And I have a certain idea -- maybe not a plan, but an idea -- for China,\" he said in an interview.\n\n\"But I can't give you those plans, because if I give you those plans, I'm not going to be able to use them, they'll be very unsuccessful. You know, part of it's surprise, right?\"\n\nTrump presented himself as an unconditional defender of Israel when the war with Hamas broke out. But he has since appeared more critical in his comments about the US ally's military offensive in Gaza, saying: \"I'm not sure that I'm loving the way they're doing it.\"",

                "body": "Washington -- Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are set to meet in Philadelphia on Tuesday for their first -- and perhaps only -- debate before the November presidential election.\n\nThe match-up will mark the first time Trump and Harris have met in person, and it comes at a crucial point in the election season. A new CBS News poll shows the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees locked in tight races in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin with less than 60 days until voters choose who will be the next president.\n\nHosted by ABC News, the debate was initially supposed to be the second meeting of Trump and President Biden, but Mr. Biden's decision in late July to bow out of the race set off a frenetic series of events that culminated with Harris accepting the Democratic presidential nomination at the party's convention last month.\n\nThe weeks leading up to the debate have seen the two sides sparring over the rules. Harris' campaign pushed for microphones to be on throughout the debate, while Trump said his campaign agreed to the same rules that were in place for the first face-off. When he and Mr. Biden met, microphones were active only when a candidate was speaking.\n\nMuted microphones ultimately prevailed after Harris' campaign accepted the rules set forth by ABC, though it warned she will be \"fundamentally disadvantaged\" by the format.\n\nThe debate is set to run 90 minutes and will be hosted by ABC's David Muir and Linsey Davis. Both candidates will stand behind podiums, and they cannot bring props or prewritten notes on stage, according to rules released by ABC. There will not be a public audience in the room. ABC is allowing other TV networks to simulcast the debate.\n\nHarris has spent the days leading up to the meeting in Pittsburgh, where she participated in extended mock debates, and arrived in Philadelphia on Monday night. Trump, meanwhile, has been going over policy positions with advisers in the run-up to the event, though his preparations have been characterized as informal.\n\nThe ABC-hosted debate is the only one that both Harris and Trump have agreed to so far. The former president had proposed a total of three match-ups, with the other two hosted by Fox News and NBC News. But the vice president has only agreed to Tuesday's debate, while her campaign has indicated she would be open to one more in October. Trump has also suggested several times he may pull out of the ABC debate while criticizing its top hosts, though he appears poised to participate.",

                "title": "Trump and Harris' views on abortion and IVF access, explained",
                "body": "Washington -- Abortion is one of the issues that could drive voters' decisions in the November election, the first presidential contest held since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago and paved the way for 22 states to restrict access to the procedure. Going into the 2024 election, the two presidential nominees, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, have talked about their views of and stances on abortion and and what the future might hold for abortion access if elected.\n\nDemocrats are hoping the issue of abortion access will galvanize voters to elect Harris, while Republicans have sought to frame the issue as one best left to the states, while facing questions about whether a federal abortion ban would be on the table if former President Donald Trump were elected to a second term.\n\nAn August CBS News poll found that 60% of voters believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, and among women likely voters who want abortion to be legal, 76% support Harris.\n\nHere is where Trump and Harris stand on abortion.\n\nTrump has throughout the campaign had shifting views on abortion, frustrating social conservatives and anti-abortion rights groups that are pushing for a nationwide ban. The Republican nominee has repeatedly taken credit for the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade in June 2022 and touted that three of the justices he appointed to the high court voted to unwind the constitutional right to abortion.\n\nHe has said the court's landmark decision means the issue is now left up to voters in the states.\n\n\"My view is now that we have abortion where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land,\" he said in a video posted to social media in April.\n\nTrump has stopped short of backing a federal abortion ban, but said during a March radio interview that \"people are agreeing on 15, and I'm thinking in terms of that.\"\n\nStill, as Democrats, including Harris, have sought to tie Trump and Republicans to abortion restrictions enacted in 22 states after Roe was reversed, the former president has attempted to counter their attacks.\n\n\"My administration will be great for women and their reproductive rights,\" he declared on social media on Aug. 23, the morning after Harris delivered a speech accepting the Democratic presidential nomination that claimed Trump's second-term agenda includes limiting access to birth control, outlawing medication abortion and banning abortion nationwide.\n\nThe former president has also criticized some of the most restrictive state laws on abortion -- namely a six-week ban in place in Florida, where he lives -- and said he favors exceptions in cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is at risk. The former president called Florida's ban a \"terrible thing and a terrible mistake.\"\n\nHe reiterated in an interview with NBC News in September that six weeks is \"too short\" and said he is \"going to be voting that we need more than six weeks.\"\n\nTrump's comments earned him swift backlash from conservatives, who criticized him for supporting a proposed amendment to the Florida Constitution that is on the November ballot. The measure would prohibit laws that restrict abortion before fetal viability, generally considered to be between 22 and 24 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nTrump quickly backtracked amid the fallout and said he would be voting \"no\" on the abortion amendment, which, if defeated in November, would leave Florida's six-week ban in place.\n\nHarris has made abortion rights a focal point of her campaign and has worked to connect abortion restrictions enacted in more than 20 states to the Republican nominee, calling them \"Trump abortion bans\" in speeches from the trail.\n\nIn her keynote address at the Democratic National Convention accepting the party's presidential nominee, the vice president pledged to sign into law legislation that restores the federal right to abortion -- if such a bill is passed by Congress.\n\n\"Ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom, like the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do,\" she said during a campaign event in Savannah.\n\nHarris' campaign website pledges that if elected president, \"she will never allow a national abortion ban to become law. And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide, she will sign it.\"\n\nAccess to in vitro fertilization (IVF) services became a campaign issue after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled in February that frozen embryos created during the IVF process could be considered children. The decision threatened the availability of IVF services in Alabama and thrust access to fertility treatments into the national conversation, including among the presidential candidates.\n\nTrump announced last month a new plan that would require the federal government to pay for IVF treatments or mandate insurance companies cover costs associated with IVF, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars per cycle.\n\nHarris, though, has pinned the blame for any threats to fertility treatments on Trump, calling him the \"architect of this entire crisis.\" The vice president said the Alabama Supreme Court's ruling is a \"direct result\" of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe.\n\nHarris has repeatedly said she supports a woman's right to make decisions about her body and family-planning, and lamented in her convention speech that since Roe's reversal, she has heard stories of couples who have had their IVF treatments cut off.",

                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will meet for the first time face-to-face Tuesday night for perhaps their only debate, a high-pressure opportunity to showcase their starkly different visions for the country after a tumultuous campaign summer.\n\nThe event, at 9 p.m. Eastern in Philadelphia, will offer Americans their most detailed look at a campaign that's dramatically changed since the last debate in June. In rapid fashion, President Joe Biden bowed out of the race after his disastrous performance, Trump survived an assassination attempt and bothsides chose their running mates.\n\nHarris is intent on demonstrating that she can press the Democratic case against Trump better than Biden did. Trump, in turn, is trying to paint the vice president as an out-of-touch liberal while trying to win over voters skeptical he should return to the White House.\n\nTrump, 78, has struggled to adapt to Harris, 59, who is the first woman, Black person and person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president. The Republican former president has at times resorted to invoking racial and gender stereotypes, frustrating allies who want Trump to focus instead on policy differences with Harris.\n\nThe vice president, for her part, will try to claim a share of credit for the Biden administration's accomplishments while also addressing its low moments and explaining her shifts away from more liberal positions she took in the past.\n\nThe debate will subject Harris, who has sat for only a single formal interview in the past six weeks, to a rare moment of sustained questioning.\n\n\"If she performs great, it's going to be a nice surprise for the Democrats and they'll rejoice,\" said Ari Fleischer, a Republican communications strategist and former press secretary to President George W. Bush. \"If she flops, like Joe Biden did, it could break this race wide open. So there's more riding on it.\"\n\nTim Hogan, who led Sen. Amy Klobuchar's debate preparations in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, said Harris, a former California attorney general, would bring a \"prosecutor's instincts to the debate stage.\"\n\n\"That is a very strong quality in that setting: having someone who knows how to land a punch and how to translate it,\" Hogan said.\n\nThe first early ballots of the presidential race will go out just hours after the debate, hosted by ABC News. Absentee ballots are set to be sent out beginning Wednesday in Alabama.\n\nTrump plans to hit Harris as too liberal\n\nTrump and his campaign have spotlighted far-left positions she took during her failed 2020 presidential bid. He's been assisted in his informal debate prep sessions by Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate who tore into Harris during their primary debates.\n\nHarris has sought to defend her shifts away from liberal causes to more moderate stances on fracking, expanding Medicare for all and mandatory gun buyback programs -- and even backing away from her position that plastic straws should be banned -- as pragmatism, insisting that her \"values remain the same.\" Her campaign on Monday published a page on its website listing her positions on key issues.\n\nThe former president has argued a Harris presidency is a threat to the safety of the country, highlighting that Biden tapped her to address the influx of migrants as the Republican once again makes dark warnings about immigration and those in the country illegally central to his campaign. He has sought to portray a Harris presidency as the continuation of Biden's still-unpopular administration, particularly his economic record, as voters still feel the bite of inflation even as it has cooled in recent months.\n\nTrump's team insist his tone won't be any different facing a female opponent.\n\n\"President Trump is going to be himself,\" senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters during a phone call Monday.\n\nGabbard, who was also on the call, added that Trump \"respects women and doesn't feel the need to be patronizing or to speak to women in any other way than he would speak to a man.\"\n\nHis advisers suggest Harris has a tendency to express herself in a \"word salad\" of meaningless phrases, prompting Trump to say last week that his debate strategy was to \"let her talk.\"\n\nThe former president frequently plows into rambling remarks that detour from his policy points. He regularly makes false claims about the last election, attacks a lengthy list of enemies and opponents working against him, offers praise for foreign strongmen and comments about race, like his false claim in July that Harris recently \"happened to turn Black.\"\n\nHarris wants to argue Trump is unstable and unfit\n\nThe vice president, who has been the Biden administration's most outspoken supporter of abortion access after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, is expected to focus on calling out Trump's inconsistencies around women's reproductive care, including his announcement that he will vote to protect Florida's six-week abortion ban in a statewide referendum this fall.\n\nHarris was also set to try to portray herself as a steadier hand to lead the nation and safeguard its alliances, as war rages in Ukraine more than two years after Russia's invasion and Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza drags on with no end in sight.\n\nShe is likely to warn that Trump presents a threat to democracy, from his attempts in 2020 to overturn his loss in the presidential election, spurring his angry supporters to attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, through comments he made as recently as last weekend. Trump on social media issued yet another message of retribution, threatening that if he wins he will jail \"those involved in unscrupulous behavior,\" including lawyers, political operatives, donors, voters and election officials.\n\nHarris has spent the better part of the last five days ensconced in debate preparations in Pennsylvania, where she participated in hours-long mock sessions with a Trump stand-in. Ahead of the debate, she told radio host Rickey Smiley that she was workshopping how to respond if Trump lies.\n\n\"There's no floor for him in terms of how low he will go,\" she said.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

                "title": "Harris leads Trump on \"excitement factor\" in these 3 battleground states",
                "body": "Washington -- Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are locked in a tight race in three key battleground states heading into their first debate on Tuesday, but Harris leads in a couple of areas. One is the \"excitement factor\": Democrats in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin are more excited about what they've seen from Harris' campaign recently than Republicans are about what they've seen from Trump's, according to a new CBS News poll.\n\nEighty-nine percent of Democrats in Michigan, 82% in Pennsylvania and 87% in Wisconsin say they're excited by Harris campaign. By comparison, among Republicans, 78% said the same of Trump in Michigan, 75% in Pennsylvania and 76% in Wisconsin.\n\nThe changes at the top of the Democratic ticket that followed President Biden's departure from the campaign in July upended the race just months to go before Election Day, as Democrats are trying to continue to capitalize on any momentum and sustain excitement heading toward November.\n\nNow, Democrats in the three battleground states are also just as likely as Republicans to say they will definitely vote, as Harris has consolidated the votes among the party's base. But Trump leads in the states among some key issues, including the economy and inflation.\n\nIn a national survey conducted before Harris formally accepted the nomination last month, most Democrats were excited about the vice president, and more Democrats said they would vote since she became the nominee. Her campaign also announced huge fundraising numbers, $540 million for August, nearly triple what Trump raised. But whether Harris can sustain the excitement and channel it into a lead in the battleground states remains to be seen.\n\nOne measure that's very different since Mr. Biden and Trump faced off in June is that now it's Harris who's seen by more as having the cognitive and mental health to serve, and Trump comparatively less so. In Michigan, 64% say she has the cognitive and mental health to serve, compared with 47% for Trump. In Pennsylvania, it's Harris with 64% again on this question and 49% for Trump. And in Wisconsin, Harris has her widest margin on Trump on this question, 68% to 48%. This was very different in CBS News' national polling conducted when Mr. Biden was still running: 35% of registered voters thought he had the cognitive and mental health to serve, and 50% thought Trump did.\n\nEarlier this month, the Harris campaign worked to tamp down expectations, saying that while \"Americans are energized behind that message,\" citing fundraising success, volunteer interests and a \"spike in enthusiasm,\" the fight ahead is a serious one.\n\n\"Make no mistake,\" Campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said in a memo. \"We head into the final stretch of this race as the clear underdogs.\"",

                "title": "Army veteran who survived bomb attack in Afghanistan could upset Dem in key Nevada Senate race, GOP leaders say",
                "body": "LAS VEGAS -- Sam Brown, a first-time candidate in Nevada who could tip control of the upper chamber this November, can score an upset against first-term Democrat Sen. Jacky Rosen, GOP leaders say.\n\nBrown, 40, a combat veteran who survived massive burn injuries during a 2008 incident in Afghanistan when a roadside bomb exploded under his vehicle's fuel tank, trails 67-year-old Rosen by 10.7 percentage points in the current RealClear Politics polling average.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is in a virtual Silver State tie with VP Kamala Harris. The Democrat nominee has a 0.6% RCP average poll lead, well within the margin of error. But one insider from Brown's campaign said their internal polls are showing the Senate race is also within the margin of error.\n\nAlthough the late Democrat Sen. Harry Reid -- who spent 30 years in the Senate including eight as majority leader -- remains an influential presence here three years after his death, there are signs Nevada could tip towards the GOP, especially if Trump carries the state this year.\n\nTwo years ago, Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, whose father preceded Reid as Nevada Senator, lost a Senate bid to Catherine Cortez Masto by 8,000 votes. That's roughly four ballots per precinct, per Montana Sen. Steve Daines, who heads up the GOP's Senate campaign arm. Bad 2022 election day weather -- snow in northern Nevada and light rain in the southern part of the state -- may have held back GOP turnout, he added.\n\nThat's not to mention the uphill battle for turnout in midterm elections with no presidential candidates topping the ticket, which was the case in 2022. Daines insisted that in 2024, however, trends favor the GOP.\n\n\"Remember, on that night ... Joe Lombardo was also elected governor,\" Daines said. So Nevada elected a Republican governor in 2022, the only Republican governor pickup in the nation\" that year.\n\nBrown's \"voters haven't come home yet,\" Daines said of the state's Republicans, \"but they will come home.\" He said that efforts from groups such as the Club for Growth, which is pledging $2 million in support of Brown's bid, will also pay off.\n\nFlorida Sen. Rick Scott, who chaired the GOP Senate campaign arm last midterm election cycle, was equally optimistic about Brown's prospects when speaking with reporters last week.\n\n\"I think Sam's going to win,\" said Scott, who's angling for majority leader if Republicans regain control of the Senate. \"He's clearly a war hero, he went to serve this country. He's got the right views. He knows that we can't have have government that has no accountability. We've got to support Israel. We've got to destroy Hamas.\"\n\nRosen has counterpunched Brown's campaign with ads claiming the Republican would support a nationwide abortion ban, which he denies. She claimed in a statement Brown \"will say anything to get elected as he tries to cover up his decade-long opposition to abortion rights.\"\n\nBut the Brown campaign insider said Rosen's abortion refrain is an attempted deflection from issues affecting Nevadans' pocketbooks.\n\n\"They only want to talk about abortion because Jackie's record on housing affordability, on voting, for spending packages that just have increased inflation, increased our national debt, which hits everyone in the pocketbook,\" the insider said of the Rosen campaign.\n\nRosen and Brown will meet Oct. 17 in a televised debate hosted by KLAS-TV in Las Vegas. Their discussion will be simulcast in Reno and then later aired locally in Spanish by Univision.",

The Republican former president has at times resorted to invoking racial and gender stereotypes, frustrating allies who want Trump to focus instead on policy differences with Harris.\n\nThe vice president, for her part, will try to claim a share of credit for the Biden administration's accomplishments while also addressing its low moments and explaining her shifts away from more liberal positions she took in the past.\n\nThe debate will subject Harris, who has sat for only a single formal interview in the past six weeks, to a rare moment of sustained questioning.\n\n\"If she performs great, it's going to be a nice surprise for the Democrats and they'll rejoice,\" said Ari Fleischer, a Republican communications strategist and former press secretary to President George W.

He has sought to portray a Harris presidency as the continuation of Biden's still-unpopular administration, particularly his economic record, as voters still feel the bite of inflation even as it has cooled in recent months.\n\nTrump's team insist his tone won't be any different facing a female opponent.\n\n\"President Trump is going to be himself,\" senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters during a phone call Monday.\n\nGabbard, who was also on the call, added that Trump \"respects women and doesn't feel the need to be patronizing or to speak to women in any other way than he would speak to a man.\"\n\nHis advisers suggest Harris has a tendency to express herself in a \"word salad\" of meaningless phrases, prompting Trump to say last week that his debate strategy was to \"let her talk.\"\n\nThe former president frequently plows into rambling remarks that detour from his policy points. He regularly makes false claims about the last election, attacks a lengthy list of enemies and opponents working against him, offers praise for foreign strongmen and comments about race, like his false claim in July that Harris recently \"happened to turn Black.\"\n\nThe vice president, who has been the Biden administration's most outspoken supporter of abortion access after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, is expected to focus on calling out Trump's inconsistencies around women's reproductive care, including his announcement that he will vote to protect Florida's six-week abortion ban in a statewide referendum this fall.\n\nHarris was also set to try to portray herself as a steadier hand to lead the nation and safeguard its alliances, as war rages in Ukraine more than two years after Russia's invasion and Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza drags on with no end in sight.\n\nShe is likely to warn that Trump presents a threat to democracy, from his attempts in 2020 to overturn his loss in the presidential election, spurring his angry supporters to attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, through comments he made as recently as last weekend. Trump on social media issued yet another message of retribution, threatening that if he wins he will jail \"those involved in unscrupulous behavior,\" including lawyers, political operatives, donors, voters and election officials.\n\nHarris has spent the better part of the last five days ensconced in debate preparations in Pennsylvania, where she participated in hours-long mock sessions with a Trump stand-in.

                "body": "WASHINGTON, Sept 10, -- Mass expulsions? Political revenge? World peace? A new golden age? As Donald Trump vies for another term in the White House, the country is abuzz with speculation over how life might look with the ex-president back at the helm.\n\nHere are Trump's plans for the United States and the world, in five emblematic measures.\n\nMass deportations\n\nVice President Kamala Harris's rival in November's election has pledged to launch the biggest deportation operation of illegal migrants in US history on his first day in office.\n\n\"We're going to get them out as fast as we can,\" he has said, accusing undocumented migrants of \"poisoning the blood of our country.\"\n\nThe 78-year-old, known for his unfinished US-Mexico border wall project, has said he would be happy to \"use the military\" as part of the effort and would open detention camps to process targets for expulsion.\n\n\"On day one of my new term in office, I will sign an executive order making clear to federal agencies that under the correct interpretation of the law, going forward the future children of illegal aliens will not receive automatic US citizenship,\" he said in a campaign video.\n\nHe has confirmed he also plans to reinstate his ban on entries from several Muslim-majority countries, as a means of \"keeping terrorists the hell out of our country.\"\n\n'Drill, baby, drill!'\n\nTrump slammed the door on the 2015 Paris climate accords during his first term, and his campaign has said he intends to end US participation again if reelected.\n\nHe told supporters at a rally earlier in the summer that he would \"stop Biden's wasteful spending and rapidly terminate the green new scam\" -- a reference to the funding committed by his successor to mitigating climate change.\n\n\"I will repeal crooked Joe Biden's insane electric vehicle mandate and we will 'drill, baby, drill,'\" Trump said in Wisconsin, using an old Republican slogan.\n\n\"Energy costs will come down very quickly,\" he vowed. \"In many cases we'll be cutting your energy costs in half.\"\n\nCrypto-a-go-go\n\nTrump has pledged to make the United States the \"Bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world,\" and to put tech billionaire and right-wing conspiracy theorist Elon Musk in charge of a wide-ranging audit of governmental waste.\n\nTrump also envisages tariffs of \"more than 10 percent\" on all imports. US companies -- and eventually their customers -- pay for import tariffs, not the companies exporting the goods.\n\nHe insists that the revenue collected will finance a \"middle class, upper class, lower class, business class big tax cut.\"\n\nHaving waged a fierce trade war with China during his first term, he also plans to revoke the Asian giant's \"most favoured nation\" status, granted to promote trade.\n\nAbortion ambiguity\n\nTrump never misses an opportunity to point out that it is partly thanks to him -- and his three conservative Supreme Court appointments -- that abortion rights have been considerably weakened in the United States.\n\nBut he is more ambiguous about the future of access to reproductive health care.\n\nInsisting it should be an issue for the individual states, the Republican has balked at pushing a nationwide abortion ban, a commitment that would win him support from the religious right.\n\n\"You must follow your heart on this issue but remember, you must also win elections,\" he has said.\n\nAnd he promised: \"My Administration will be great for women and their reproductive rights.\"\n\nUkraine war 'plan'\n\nTrump has been saying for months he could end the war in Ukraine within \"24 hours,\" without explaining how.\n\nCritics suggest his plan would involve pressuring Kyiv to cede territory illegally occupied by Russia in both 2014 and 2022.\n\n\"I have a very exacting plan how to stop Ukraine and Russia, And I have a certain idea -- maybe not a plan, but an idea -- for China,\" he said in an interview.\n\n\"But I can't give you those plans, because if I give you those plans, I'm not going to be able to use them, they'll be very unsuccessful. You know, part of it's surprise, right?\"\n\nTrump presented himself as an unconditional defender of Israel when the war with Hamas broke out. But he has since appeared more critical in his comments about the US ally's military offensive in Gaza, saying: \"I'm not sure that I'm loving the way they're doing it.\" -- AFP",

                "title": "The Harris-Trump debate becomes the 2024 election's latest landmark event",
                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will meet for the first time face-to-face Tuesday night for perhaps their only debate, a high-pressure opportunity to showcase their starkly different visions for the country after a tumultuous campaign summer.\n\nThe event, at 9 p.m. Eastern in Philadelphia, will offer Americans their most detailed look at a campaign that's dramatically changed since the last debate in June. In rapid fashion, President Joe Biden bowed out of the race after his disastrous performance, Trump survived an assassination attempt, and both sides chose their running mates.\n\nHarris is intent on demonstrating that she can press the Democratic case against Trump better than Biden did. Trump, in turn, is trying to paint the vice president as an out-of-touch liberal while trying to win over voters skeptical he should return to the White House.\n\nTrump, 78, has struggled to adapt to Harris, 59, who is the first woman, Black person and person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president. The Republican former president has at times resorted to invoking racial and gender stereotypes, frustrating allies who want Trump to focus instead on policy differences with Harris.\n\nThe vice president, for her part, will try to claim a share of credit for the Biden administration's accomplishments while also addressing its low moments and explaining her shifts away from more liberal positions she took in the past.\n\nThe debate will subject Harris, who has sat for only a single formal interview in the past six weeks, to a rare moment of sustained questioning.\n\n\"If she performs great, it's going to be a nice surprise for the Democrats and they'll rejoice,\" said Ari Fleischer, a Republican communications strategist and former press secretary to President George W. Bush. \"If she flops, like Joe Biden did, it could break this race wide open. So there's more riding on it.\"\n\nTim Hogan, who led Sen. Amy Klobuchar's debate preparations in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, said Harris, a former California attorney general, would bring a \"prosecutor's instincts to the debate stage.\"\n\n\"That is a very strong quality in that setting: having someone who knows how to land a punch and how to translate it,\" Hogan said.\n\nThe first early ballots of the presidential race will go out just hours after the debate, hosted by ABC News. Absentee ballots are set to be sent out beginning Wednesday in Alabama.\n\nTrump and his campaign have spotlighted far-left positions she took during her failed 2020 presidential bid. He's been assisted in his informal debate prep sessions by Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate who tore into Harris during their primary debates.\n\nHarris has sought to defend her shifts away from liberal causes to more moderate stances on fracking, expanding Medicare for all and mandatory gun buyback programs -- and even backing away from her position that plastic straws should be banned -- as pragmatism, insisting that her \"values remain the same.\" Her campaign on Monday published a page on its website listing her positions on key issues.\n\nThe former president has argued a Harris presidency is a threat to the safety of the country, highlighting that Biden tapped her to address the influx of migrants as the Republican once again makes dark warnings about immigration and those in the country illegally central to his campaign. He has sought to portray a Harris presidency as the continuation of Biden's still-unpopular administration, particularly his economic record, as voters still feel the bite of inflation even as it has cooled in recent months.\n\nTrump's team insist his tone won't be any different facing a female opponent.\n\n\"President Trump is going to be himself,\" senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters during a phone call Monday.\n\nGabbard, who was also on the call, added that Trump \"respects women and doesn't feel the need to be patronizing or to speak to women in any other way than he would speak to a man.\"\n\nHis advisers suggest Harris has a tendency to express herself in a \"word salad\" of meaningless phrases, prompting Trump to say last week that his debate strategy was to \"let her talk.\"\n\nThe former president frequently plows into rambling remarks that detour from his policy points. He regularly makes false claims about the last election, attacks a lengthy list of enemies and opponents working against him, offers praise for foreign strongmen and comments about race, like his false claim in July that Harris recently \"happened to turn Black.\"\n\nThe vice president, who has been the Biden administration's most outspoken supporter of abortion access after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, is expected to focus on calling out Trump's inconsistencies around women's reproductive care, including his announcement that he will vote to protect Florida's six-week abortion ban in a statewide referendum this fall.\n\nHarris was also set to try to portray herself as a steadier hand to lead the nation and safeguard its alliances, as war rages in Ukraine more than two years after Russia's invasion and Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza drags on with no end in sight.\n\nShe is likely to warn that Trump presents a threat to democracy, from his attempts in 2020 to overturn his loss in the presidential election, spurring his angry supporters to attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, through comments he made as recently as last weekend. Trump on social media issued yet another message of retribution, threatening that if he wins he will jail \"those involved in unscrupulous behavior,\" including lawyers, political operatives, donors, voters and election officials.\n\nHarris has spent the better part of the last five days ensconced in debate preparations in Pennsylvania, where she participated in hours-long mock sessions with a Trump stand-in. Ahead of the debate, she told radio host Rickey Smiley that she was workshopping how to respond if Trump lies.\n\n\"There's no floor for him in terms of how low he will go,\" she said.\n\n___\n\nAP Polling Editor Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux in Washington and Associated Press writers Thomas Beaumont in Las Vegas, Bill Barrow in Atlanta and Josh Boak in Pittsburgh contributed to this report.",

                "body": "philadelphia - It is the birthplace of U.S. independence, the 'City of Brotherly Love,' and the hometown of beloved fictional boxer 'Rocky' Balboa.\n\nNow Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, will be center stage again when Kamala Harris and Donald Trump meet in a highly anticipated televised debate that could weigh heavily on the November election.\n\nThe two, who have never met in person, will square off at 9 p.m. ET (0100 GMT) for a 90-minute debate hosted by ABC News.\n\nPolice are bracing for protests, with pro-Palestinian groups angry with Harris' continued support of Israel planning to demonstrate. Barricades have been erected around the National Constitution Center, the site of the debate, barring access to the historic area that includes the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall, where the U.S. Constitution was signed.\n\nPeople wave as the motorcade with the Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, arrives near her hotel in Philadelphia, Sept. 9, 2024, ahead of the presidential debate with Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, several of the city's bars and universities are planning watch parties. Top Democrats will gather at a hotel for a watch party that Harris is expected to attend after the debate ends. Trump's plans after the debate are not yet public.\n\nSome Philadelphia residents said they hoped to learn more about Harris.\n\n'I wasn't, like, super impressed with her in 2020 when she had the presidential debates and for the primary,' said Dan Bessler, a Philadelphia resident and sales worker. 'But she is a prosecutor. ... I think she'll be able to hold her own better than Biden was able to at his age.'\n\nPresident Joe Biden's faltering debate performance against Trump in June essentially ended his political career, sparking powerful Democrats to convince him he should step aside ahead and allow Harris, his vice president, to run instead.\n\nSince then, Harris has broken fundraising records and sparked new enthusiasm in the party, but opinion polls suggest a tight race looms with Trump.\n\nWith 19 electoral votes, Pennsylvania is the biggest prize of the basket of battleground states expected to decide the election. Most pundits predict whoever wins Pennsylvania will win the White House.\n\nDemocrats historically win Pennsylvania by running up huge margins in Philadelphia, to offset losses throughout much of the rest of the state.\n\nIn 2020, the city saw its highest turnout since 1984 - 68% - but it paled beside the statewide figure of 76.5%.\n\nReuters is a news agency founded in 1851 and owned by the Thomson Reuters Corporation based in Toronto, Canada.

                "body": "Washington DC [US], September 10 (ANI): Ahead of the US presidential elections this November, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are set to face off in their first debate in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday.\n\nThe debate will mark the first time that the Democratic and Republican candidate will meet in person and share a stage. The two will spar for 90 minutes in a setting, which will have no studio audience nor will the two be allowed to have pre-written notes or props. The two candidates will also not be permitted to question each other directly.\n\nABC News outlet, which is moderating the debate, said the showdown is taking place months after the last debate ended President Joe Biden's re-election bid and catapulted Harris as the Democratic candidate.\n\nAs the countdown to Election Day reaches its final stretch, the stakes have never been higher. Tonight's highly anticipated debate will see the candidates grilled on the issues that matter most to voters, including the economy, immigration, and reproductive rights, as each tries to persuade millions of voters and viewers that they're the ones best suited to be president.\n\n\"I think there's an outsized expectation of 'gosh, the last guy dropped out, let's watch it.' So, I think that there's a lot more at stake than normally I would ever say is at stake,\" said Sean Spicer, Trump's first White House press secretary, as cited by ABC.\n\nTonight's highly anticipated debate promises to be a pivotal moment for Kamala Harris, as she faces intense scrutiny over the Biden administration's handling of contentious issues like border security and inflation. Moderators will likely push her to reconcile her current positions with the more liberal stances she took during her 2020 presidential campaign, including her recent shifts on fracking, border policy, and healthcare.\n\nDonald Trump, renowned for his capacity to dominate the political conversation and exploit his opponents' vulnerabilities, will likely seek to capitalize on his strengths on immigration and trade.\n\nAs Trump engages with Harris, he must tread carefully to avoid alienating female voters, among whom his support is already tenuous. If he comes across as condescending or dismissive, it could further erode his standing with this critical demographic. Harris, as the first woman of color to run for vice president on a major party ticket, presents a historic opportunity for the Democratic Party to connect with diverse voters and challenge Trump's divisive rhetoric.\n\nDemocrats who spoke to ABC News said that Harris has two main goals \"affirm to voters that she is ready to lead the country and the free world and to describe in more detail what policies she'd pursue as president.\"Similarly, Republicans who spoke to ABC News said Trump should focus on policy contrasts, boasting that he has the edge on issues like inflation and immigration and can try to pin her down on her policy reversals on things like fracking - while he himself searches for consistent stances on issues like abortion.\n\nABC News said that Trump blamed the Biden-Harris administration's handling of the economy, saying their policies are to blame for inflation, which reached a 40-year high in 2022 but has since cooled to 2.9 per cent year-over-year as of July.\n\nTrump has pledged to cut costs by restoring \"energy independence\" through drilling more oil and lowering gas prices. He's also said he would reduce the national debt, eliminate regulations and implement a variety of tax cuts for domestic corporations as well as tariffs on foreign imports.\n\nHarris has presented an \"opportunity economy\" plan, which includes USD 25,000 in down-payment support for first-time homeowners, construction of 3 million new housing units, raising the minimum wage and a federal ban on corporate price-gouging on food and groceries.\n\nShe has also pitched a USD 50,000 tax benefit for new small businesses and a lower long-term capital gains tax of 28 per cent.\n\n\"World News Tonight\" anchor and managing editor David Muir and ABC News Live \"Prime\" anchor Linsey Davis will serve as moderators.\n\nIt's a big test for the Disney-owned network in the only scheduled debate between Harris and Trump in the 2024 race that could serve as a make-or-break moment for either campaign.\n\nSo while this debate could help set the political environment for the last two months of the 2024 presidential race, it also will be the last chance for the two candidates to reach some voters in states where every ballot matters.

Tonight's highly anticipated debate will see the candidates grilled on the issues that matter most to voters, including the economy, immigration, and reproductive rights, as each tries to persuade millions of voters and viewers that they're the ones best suited to be president.\n\n\"I think there's an outsized expectation of 'gosh, the last guy dropped out, let's watch it.' So, I think that there's a lot more at stake than normally I would ever say is at stake,\" said Sean Spicer, Trump's first White House press secretary, as cited by ABC.\n\nTonight's highly anticipated debate promises to be a pivotal moment for Kamala Harris, as she faces intense scrutiny over the Biden administration's handling of contentious issues like border security and inflation. Moderators will likely push her to reconcile her current positions with the more liberal stances she took during her 2020 presidential campaign, including her recent shifts on fracking, border policy, and healthcare.\n\nDonald Trump, renowned for his capacity to dominate the political conversation and exploit his opponents' vulnerabilities, will likely seek to capitalize on his strengths on immigration and trade.\n\nAs Trump engages with Harris, he must tread carefully to avoid alienating female voters, among whom his support is already tenuous. If he comes across as condescending or dismissive, it could further erode his standing with this critical demographic. Harris, as the first woman of color to run for vice president on a major party ticket, presents a historic opportunity for the Democratic Party to connect with diverse voters and challenge Trump's divisive rhetoric.\n\nDemocrats who spoke to ABC News said that Harris has two main goals \"affirm to voters that she is ready to lead the country and the free world and to describe in more detail what policies she'd pursue as president.\"Similarly, Republicans who spoke to ABC News said Trump should focus on policy contrasts, boasting that he has the edge on issues like inflation and immigration and can try to pin her down on her policy reversals on things like fracking - while he himself searches for consistent stances on issues like abortion.\n\nABC News said that Trump blamed the Biden-Harris administration's handling of the economy, saying their policies are to blame for inflation, which reached a 40-year high in 2022 but has since cooled to 2.9 per cent year-over-year as of July.\n\nTrump has pledged to cut costs by restoring \"energy independence\" through drilling more oil and lowering gas prices. He's also said he would reduce the national debt, eliminate regulations and implement a variety of tax cuts for domestic corporations as well as tariffs on foreign imports.\n\nHarris has presented an \"opportunity economy\" plan, which includes USD 25,000 in down-payment support for first-time homeowners, construction of 3 million new housing units, raising the minimum wage and a federal ban on corporate price-gouging on food and groceries.\n\nShe has also pitched a USD 50,000 tax benefit for new small businesses and a lower long-term capital gains tax of 28 per cent.\n\n\"World News Tonight\" anchor and managing editor David Muir and ABC News Live \"Prime\" anchor Linsey Davis will serve as moderators.\n\nIt's a big test for the Disney-owned network in the only scheduled debate between Harris and Trump in the 2024 race that could serve as a make-or-break moment for either campaign.\n\nSo while this debate could help set the political environment for the last two months of the 2024 presidential race, it also will be the last chance for the two candidates to reach some voters in states where every ballot matters.

                "body": "WASHINGTON -- Presidential debates matter in American politics. And the one that takes place on Tuesday night between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris - their only currently scheduled face-off - may matter more than most.\n\nJoe Biden's poor performance in the first presidential debate in late June created a firestorm of pressure within the Democratic Party that ultimately forced him to abandon his re-election campaign.\n\nEven though Kamala Harris has been vice president for more than three years and a candidate for president for seven weeks, she is still a relative unknown for many Americans. In a recent New York Times survey, 28% of likely November voters said that they needed to know more about the Californian.\n\nThat poll showed the race a statistical dead heat - a finding most recent surveys have also indicated, both nationally and in key battleground states. The 2024 presidential campaign has been full of historic tumult, but the American electorate is still sharply - and narrowly - divided.\n\nThat underscores the importance of Tuesday night's debate, where even small shifts in the mood of the electorate could be the difference between victory and defeat for the candidates.\n\nFor Ms Harris, the showdown in Philadelphia provides an opportunity for her to flesh out the details before an audience of tens of millions - although she will have to do so while under rhetorical fire from her Republican opponent.\n\nThis opportunity is not without risks, however, as Ms Harris could define herself - and her positions - in ways that damage her electoral prospects. She has struggled in the past with answering pointed questions under pressure, and her reluctance to sit for media interviews in the opening weeks of her campaign has denied her the opportunity to hone her linguistic chops.\n\nAlthough she has tried to present herself as the change candidate in this election, the moderators - and the former president - are likely to press her to defend the Biden administration's record, particularly on areas where polls show Democrats are weak, such as border security and inflation.\n\nShe will also have to explain why she has renounced some of the more liberal policies she embraced during her unsuccessful bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. She recently has walked back her positions on a fracking ban, decriminalizing border crossing and nationalizing health insurance, among others.\n\nShe has explained these changes as ones made to reflect new circumstances - but they may be viewed by some voters as moves born of political expediency.\n\nFor Trump, the debate presents an opportunity to wrest back the initiative in this campaign after a month where the Democrats - with their new nominee and high-energy convention - dominated political headlines. He has a history of thriving in the spotlight and setting the terms of political conversation that keeps his opponents off-balance and his issues - notably on immigration and trade, where his positions have broad popular support - at the forefront of political discussion.\n\nThe former president has his own potential pitfalls on Tuesday, however. His uneven performance during his June debate with Mr Biden drew little scrutiny because of his opponent's sometimes catastrophic verbal miscues. Ms Harris is sure to present a more nimble opponent, and his answers will have to be sharper.\n\nDuring a New York economic forum last week, he was unable to offer a clear explanation for his childcare policies. Such verbal meandering during the debate will provide Democrats with a wealth of campaign fodder.\n\nTrump must also tread carefully when sparring with the vice president - only the second woman presidential nominee and the first of color. If he comes across as domineering or belittling, he could further damage his already weak support among female voters.\n\nThe two candidates have used markedly different ways of preparing for Tuesday night's event. The vice president - and former prosecutor - has been in Pittsburgh, a few hours drive east of Philadelphia, holding mock debates and reviewing her policy proposals. The move also allowed her to campaign and benefit from some local media coverage in the largest and most crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump - who has participated in a presidential debate in each of the past three elections -- has held more informal sessions, including reviewing his positions on key issues. Last week, he participated in a town hall forum hosted by conservative cable network Fox News.\n\nTuesday, then, is set to be a contrast of styles as well as political views.\n\nAlthough election day won't arrive until November, early voting is set to begin this month in some key battleground states - including in pivotal Pennsylvania.\n\nSo while this debate could help set the political environment for the last two months of the 2024 presidential race, it also will be the last chance for the two candidates to reach some voters in states where every ballot matters. -- BBC",

                "body": "WASHINGTON (AFP): Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will clash in their first and possibly last televised debate Tuesday, in a potentially game-changing moment for the blockbuster 2024 US presidential election.\n\nThe stakes could hardly be higher for the Democratic vice president and Republican former president as tens of millions of American voters tune in to see them finally face off.\n\nA single zinger or gaffe could tip the balance of one of the most dramatic White House races in US political history, with the two rivals neck-and-neck in the polls with less than two months until election day.\n\nFor Harris, 59, it will be a critical chance to win over voters who still know little about her, as her honeymoon starts to fade after suddenly replacing President Joe Biden in July.\n\nTrump, 78, will meanwhile try to box in Harris on issues like the economy and immigration, but may also unleash more of the racist and sexist insults that he's directed her way during the campaign.\n\nThe two candidates will also be meeting in person for the first time at the ABC News debate in Pennsylvania, adding to the potential for a bruising confrontation.\n\n\"This debate may go down in the history books. Break out the popcorn,\" said Andrew Koneschusky, a former press secretary for US Senate leader Chuck Schumer.\n\n- 'No floor' -\n\nHarris, America's first female, Black and South Asian vice president, arrived in Philadelphia on the eve of the ABC News debate after five days holed up in a hotel doing intense practise sessions.\n\nOne of her aides even reportedly dressed up in a Trump-style boxy suit and long tie so she could get used to unloading her best lines on her opponent.\n\nTrump's team said he has taken a more relaxed approach ahead of his seventh presidential debate, choosing to arrive in Philadelphia just hours before and keeping his preparations limited.\n\nThe debate may lack the full-scale shouting matches of previous years, as the two candidates' microphones will be muted when they are not speaking, at the Trump team's request.\n\nBut it will still be a potential turning point -- as well as a contrast in styles.\n\nIn one corner is a former prosecutor who has in the past delivered ice-cold put-downs to debate rivals including Biden himself and Trump's former vice president Mike Pence in the past.\n\n\"There's no floor for him in terms of how low he will go,\" Harris said in a radio interview broadcast Monday. \"He is probably going to speak a lot of untruths.\"\n\n- 'Like a boxer' -\n\nIn the other corner is Trump, the most brutal knife-fighter in US politics, who has been convicted of falsifying business records to cover up a porn star scandal and is accused of trying to overturn the 2020 election.\n\n\"You can't prepare for President Trump,\" his spokesman Jason Miller said. \"Imagine like a boxer trying to prepare for Floyd Mayweather, or Muhammad Ali.\"\n\nHarris in many ways has the most to prove at the debate.\n\nHer campaign suffered a setback at the weekend when a major New York Times/Siena poll showed Trump ahead by 48 to 47 percent, with the two candidates effectively tied in the half a dozen major battleground states.\n\nShe will be under pressure to spell out her so-far vague policy manifesto to voters, who according to the NYT poll said they need to know more about her.\n\nFormer reality TV star Trump is by far the more experienced presidential debater, with six under his belt, but swing voters may be put off if he insults the candidate aiming to become America's first woman president.\n\nTrump is still reveling in the fact that his last debate opponent, the 81-year-old Biden, performed so catastrophically that he was forced to withdraw from the race.",

                "body": "LAS VEGAS -- Sam Brown, a first-time candidate in Nevada who could tip control of the upper chamber this November, can score an upset against first-term Democrat Sen. Jacky Rosen, GOP leaders say.\n\nBrown, 40, a combat veteran who survived massive burn injuries during a 2008 incident in Afghanistan when a roadside bomb exploded under his vehicle's fuel tank, trails 67-year-old Rosen by 10.7 percentage points in the current RealClear Politics polling average.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is in a virtual Silver State tie with VP Kamala Harris. The Democrat nominee has a 0.6% RCP average poll lead, well within the margin of error. But one insider from Brown's campaign said their internal polls are showing the Senate race is also within the margin of error.\n\nAlthough the late Democrat Sen. Harry Reid -- who spent 30 years in the Senate including eight as majority leader -- remains an influential presence here three years after his death, there are signs Nevada could tip towards the GOP, especially if Trump carries the state this year.\n\nTwo years ago, Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, whose father preceded Reid as Nevada Senator, lost a Senate bid to Catherine Cortez Masto by 8,000 votes. That's roughly four ballots per precinct, per Montana Sen. Steve Daines, who heads up the GOP's Senate campaign arm. Bad 2022 election day weather -- snow in northern Nevada and light rain in the southern part of the state -- may have held back GOP turnout, he added.\n\nThat's not to mention the uphill battle for turnout in midterm elections with no presidential candidates topping the ticket, which was the case in 2022. Daines insisted that in 2024, however, trends favor the GOP.\n\n\"Remember, on that night ... Joe Lombardo was also elected governor,\" Daines said. So Nevada elected a Republican governor in 2022, the only Republican governor pickup in the nation\" that year.\n\nBrown's \"voters haven't come home yet,\" Daines said of the state's Republicans, \"but they will come home.\" He said that efforts from groups such as the Club for Growth, which is pledging $2 million in support of Brown's bid, will also pay off.\n\nFlorida Sen. Rick Scott, who chaired the GOP Senate campaign arm last midterm election cycle, was equally optimistic about Brown's prospects when speaking with reporters last week.\n\n\"I think Sam's going to win,\" said Scott, who's angling for majority leader if Republicans regain control of the Senate. \"He's clearly a war hero, he went to serve this country. He's got the right views. He knows that we can't have have government that has no accountability. We've got to support Israel. We've got to destroy Hamas.\"\n\nRosen has counterpunched Brown's campaign with ads claiming the Republican would support a nationwide abortion ban, which he denies. She claimed in a statement Brown \"will say anything to get elected as he tries to cover up his decade-long opposition to abortion rights.\"\n\nBut the Brown campaign insider said Rosen's abortion refrain is an attempted deflection from issues affecting Nevadans' pocketbooks.\n\n\"They only want to talk about abortion because Jackie's record on housing affordability, on voting, for spending packages that just have increased inflation, increased our national debt, which hits everyone in the pocketbook,\" the insider said of the Rosen campaign.",

                "title": "Debate day is here: 5 things to watch for in the high-stakes Harris-Trump faceoff",
                "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump square off Tuesday at what could be their only presidential debate, setting high stakes for an event expected to be viewed by millions of Americans and a key sliver of undecided voters.\n\nHarris' momentum -- after her unusual rise as the Democrats' nominee shot her into a neck-and-neck race -- has now stalled, making the head-to-head matchup an opportunity to get that started again f she can adequately make the argument for her own candidacy and cast Trump as unfit for another term.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has struggled to find a way to consistently and effectively attack his new opponent but has remained highly competitive, thanks to a large base of immovable supporters and the broad swath of Americans who already have fixed views of him. Tuesday's debate offers him an opportunity to solidify his support while painting Harris in a negative light to an electorate that has less cemented perceptions of her.\n\nThe ABC News debate, moderated by David Muir and Linsey Davis, will take place on Tuesday, Sept. 10 at 9 p.m ET. A prime-time pre-debate special will air at 8 p.m. ET. It will air on ABC and stream on ABC News Live, Disney+ and Hulu. Viewers can also stream the debate on the ABC app on a smartphone or tablet, on ABC.com and connected devices.\n\nTrump has worked to peg Harris as a \"California liberal,\" letting voters' perceptions of the progressive bastion paint a picture of a candidate who served as the state's attorney general and junior senator. He's also hammered her on immigration and inflation -- two voter concerns on which polls suggest he has an edge.\n\nHowever, he's also veered into personal remarks, including falsely questioning Harris' racial identity (she's Black and south Asian), touting what he says are his superior good looks and promoting vulgar and false allegations that past romantic relationships of Harris' helped propel her political career.\n\nStaying on message on his four-year economic record, which saw low inflation before the pandemic and less fervor over unauthorized border crossings, is key, allies told ABC News.\n\nVeering into personal attacks would be counterproductive, they argued, drawing media attention away from what they view as a favorable policy issue set.\n\n\"I think he does,\" former White House press secretary Sean Spicer said when asked if Trump makes an effective contrast on the trail. \"If I had a critique, it would be that he'll make the case sometimes and then, with all due respect, he will sometimes go beyond the case and give the media something else to focus on.\"\n\n\"He needs to avoid creating a moment that takes the focus away from her record. So, if it's about her personality or her appearance as opposed to her record, that will change the focus of what people talk about the next day.\"\n\nWhile Trump comes in with nearly universal name recognition, 28% of likely voters in a recent New York Times/Siena College poll said they feel they \"need to learn more about Kamala Harris.\" That means that while many voters have heard of Harris, she is less defined than Trump in their eyes and thus has more work to do to introduce herself -- lest she be defined by her opposition.\n\nHarris has dual goals in Tuesday's debate: make the case for herself as someone who would be a capable president and get under Trump's skin to spark a reaction to suggest he isn't worthy of another four years in the White House.\n\n\"I think there needs to be a long litany of just pummeling Donald Trump while also being extremely clear about what your vision is for the future,\" said Bakari Sellers, a prominent Harris ally and Democratic media commentator.\n\nHarris on the trail has sought to do both.\n\nMonday, she fleshed out her policy proposals in a new page on her website, her most expansive explanation yet of her platform. And in early stump speeches, she boasted of her time working as a prosecutor and state attorney general combating gangs and other criminal activity, saying to crowds that she knows \"Donald Trump's type,\" in a clear reference to his legal travails.\n\nThey way she balances those two dictates could offer clues as to the way she and her campaign best think she can march to victory in November.\n\nHarris had a memorable debate performance in 2020, when she faced off against then-Vice President Mike Pence. Pence was muscling in on her answers, allowing her to declare, \"I'm speaking,\" in one of the more viral instances of the night.\n\nIt's unclear whether she'll be able to replicate such a moment.\n\nThe candidates' microphones will be muted while their opponent is answering a question, something Harris' team argued against in the hopes of tempting Trump to aggressively interrupt her and come off as unpresidential.\n\nIn an election in which policy is largely taking a backseat to personality, producing such a clash might possibly spark one of the debate's most notable moments.\n\nHarris has been walking a tightrope since the start of her campaign between recognizing her role in Biden's administration and touting its achievements while also casting herself as a candidate in her own right, particularly after the unusual way in which she became her party's nominee.\n\nA recent New York Times/Siena College poll showed that roughly 61% of likely voters said the next president should represent a major change from Biden. Only 25% of them said Harris represented that change, compared to 53% who said Trump did.\n\nHarris so far has appeared mostly on the campaign trail by herself, and in a joint appearance in Pittsburgh and at Democrats' convention last month, Biden spoke first before handing the stage off to Harris, underscoring her role in the electoral spotlight.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has at times focused extensively on Biden, particularly in the days and weeks after the president ended his campaign and handed the reins to Harris.\n\nSuch a strategy risks focusing too much on Biden rather than Trump's own opponent -- but, allies said, tying Harris to voter disapproval of the way the current president has handled the economy and inflation could be a boon.\n\n\"For him to be viewed as having a successful debate, he has to continue that assault,\" said one former campaign aide in touch with Trump's current team. \"She's the vice president United States seeking the second term of Joe Biden. We can make that case.\"\n\nThe last debate between Biden and Trump was clearly consequential -- it ended the former's campaign. That doesn't mean Tuesday's debate will pack the same punch.\n\nSurely, millions will tune in to the latest salvo in a race packed with unpredictable twists and turns, raising the stakes. But many debates make little more than ripples in presidential races -- an outcome that might benefit neither candidate.\n\nAs it stands, it's a neck-and-neck race. Harris would like a moment that revives her momentum, which jolted her into contention but now is stalled; Trump would like a moment to erase some of the gains Harris has made and actually reverse her improved poll numbers.",

Both are hoping to make gains with as many voters as possible in a race that is shaping up to be decided by just tens of thousands of votes spread across a handful of swing states.\n\nIt will be Trump's second debate of this cycle, having debated President Joe Biden in June in an event that ended up costing him his reelection campaign after a poor performance rattled Democratic confidence in the president's ability to win. But his opponent this time around will be much different than Biden, who at times struggled to string together sentences and forcefully rebut Trump's talking points.\n\nHarris has been preparing for the debate for more than a week and is expected to mount a much fiercer defense against Trump's attacks over the economy, immigration and other issues he is seeking to capitalize on.\n\n\"Now that her honeymoon is over, the debate will be the first time Kamala will answer tough questions. In doing so, Kamala Harris will be revealed to America as a Radical Left lunatic,\" Trump campaign advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles wrote in a memo on Monday.\n\nHarris' campaign has said she is the underdog in the race, though most polling indicates it is essentially tied and falls into the margin of error on each sample. They have also tried to build up Trump's reputation as an experienced debater, noting that he has participated in more presidential debates than any other candidate in history as he has been the Republican nominee for three consecutive cycles.\n\nThe debate starts at 9 p.m. ET. It can be viewed on ABC on TV or streaming online.",

                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will meet for the first time face-to-face Tuesday night for perhaps their only debate, a high-pressure opportunity to showcase their starkly different visions for the country after a tumultuous campaign summer.\n\nThe event, at 9 p.m. Eastern in Philadelphia, will offer Americans their most detailed look at a campaign that's dramatically changed since the last debate in June. In rapid fashion, President Joe Biden bowed out of the race after his disastrous performance, Trump survived an assassination attempt and bothsides chose their running mates.\n\nHarris is intent on demonstrating that she can press the Democratic case against Trump better than Biden did. Trump, in turn, is trying to paint the vice president as an out-of-touch liberal while trying to win over voters skeptical he should return to the White House.\n\nTrump, 78, has struggled to adapt to Harris, 59, who is the first woman, Black person and person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president. The Republican former president has at times resorted to invoking racial and gender stereotypes, frustrating allies who want Trump to focus instead on policy differences with Harris.\n\nThe vice president, for her part, will try to claim a share of credit for the Biden administration's accomplishments while also addressing its low moments and explaining her shifts away from more liberal positions she took in the past.\n\nThe debate will subject Harris, who has sat for only a single formal interview in the past six weeks, to a rare moment of sustained questioning.\n\n\"If she performs great, it's going to be a nice surprise for the Democrats and they'll rejoice,\" said Ari Fleischer, a Republican communications strategist and former press secretary to President George W. Bush. \"If she flops, like Joe Biden did, it could break this race wide open. So there's more riding on it.\"\n\nTim Hogan, who led Sen. Amy Klobuchar's debate preparations in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, said Harris, a former California attorney general, would bring a \"prosecutor's instincts to the debate stage.\"\n\n\"That is a very strong quality in that setting: having someone who knows how to land a punch and how to translate it,\" Hogan said.\n\nThe first early ballots of the presidential race will go out just hours after the debate, hosted by ABC News. Absentee ballots are set to be sent out beginning Wednesday in Alabama.\n\nTrump plans to hit Harris as too liberal\n\nTrump and his campaign have spotlighted far-left positions she took during her failed 2020 presidential bid. He's been assisted in his informal debate prep sessions by Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate who tore into Harris during their primary debates.\n\nHarris has sought to defend her shifts away from liberal causes to more moderate stances on fracking, expanding Medicare for all and mandatory gun buyback programs -- and even backing away from her position that plastic straws should be banned -- as pragmatism, insisting that her \"values remain the same.\" Her campaign on Monday published a page on its website listing her positions on key issues.\n\nThe former president has argued a Harris presidency is a threat to the safety of the country, highlighting that Biden tapped her to address the influx of migrants as the Republican once again makes dark warnings about immigration and those in the country illegally central to his campaign. He has sought to portray a Harris presidency as the continuation of Biden's still-unpopular administration, particularly his economic record, as voters still feel the bite of inflation even as it has cooled in recent months.\n\nTrump's team insist his tone won't be any different facing a female opponent.\n\n\"President Trump is going to be himself,\" senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters during a phone call Monday.\n\nGabbard, who was also on the call, added that Trump \"respects women and doesn't feel the need to be patronizing or to speak to women in any other way than he would speak to a man.\"\n\nHis advisers suggest Harris has a tendency to express herself in a \"word salad\" of meaningless phrases, prompting Trump to say last week that his debate strategy was to \"let her talk.\"\n\nThe former president frequently plows into rambling remarks that detour from his policy points. He regularly makes false claims about the last election, attacks a lengthy list of enemies and opponents working against him, offers praise for foreign strongmen and comments about race, like his false claim in July that Harris recently \"happened to turn Black.\"\n\nHarris wants to argue Trump is un\n\nstable and unfit\n\nThe vice president, who has been the Biden administration's most outspoken supporter of abortion access after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, is expected to focus on calling out Trump's inconsistencies around women's reproductive care, including his announcement that he will vote to protect Florida's six-week abortion ban in a statewide referendum this fall.\n\nHarris was also set to try to portray herself as a steadier hand to lead the nation and safeguard its alliances, as war rages in Ukraine more than two years after Russia's invasion and Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza drags on with no end in sight.\n\nShe is likely to warn that Trump presents a threat to democracy, from his attempts in 2020 to overturn his loss in the presidential election, spurring his angry supporters to attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, through comments he made as recently as last weekend. Trump on social media issued yet another message of retribution, threatening that if he wins he will jail \"those involved in unscrupulous behavior,\" including lawyers, political operatives, donors, voters and election officials.\n\nHarris has spent the better part of the last five days ensconced in debate preparations in Pennsylvania, where she participated in hours-long mock sessions with a Trump stand-in. Ahead of the debate, she told radio host Rickey Smiley that she was workshopping how to respond if Trump lies.\n\n\"There's no floor for him in terms of how low he will go,\" she said.\n\n___\n\nAP Polling Editor Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux in Washington and Associated Press writers Thomas Beaumont in Las Vegas, Bill Barrow in Atlanta and Josh Boak in Pittsburgh contributed to this report.",

A new CBS News poll shows the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees locked in tight races in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin with less than 60 days until voters choose who will be the next president.\n\nHosted by ABC News, the debate was initially supposed to be the second meeting of Trump and President Biden, but Mr. Biden's decision in late July to bow out of the race set off a frenetic series of events that culminated with Harris accepting the Democratic presidential nomination at the party's convention last month.\n\nThe weeks leading up to the debate have seen the two sides sparring over the rules. Harris' campaign pushed for microphones to be on throughout the debate, while Trump said his campaign agreed to the same rules that were in place for the first face-off. When he and Mr. Biden met, microphones were active only when a candidate was speaking.\n\nMuted microphones ultimately prevailed after Harris' campaign accepted the rules set forth by ABC, though it warned she will be \"fundamentally disadvantaged\" by the format.\n\nThe debate is set to run 90 minutes and will be hosted by ABC's David Muir and Linsey Davis.

                "body": "ALLENTOWN, Pa. -- Kamala Harris' husband headlined a slate of Democrats rallying in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley over the weekend, all of whom came out swinging against former President Donald Trump.\n\nSecond Gentleman Doug Emhoff delivered Saturday's last and longest speech in support of his wife's presidential campaign -- asserting the veep is \"who she's always been,\" despite being called out for flip-flopping on the issues.\n\n\"You know what we're seeing right now? The most badass version of Kamala Harris when we needed it!\" Emhoff told the crowd.\n\n\"This ain't a honeymoon... This is what a real leader looks like.\"\n\nEmhoff debuted some policy proposals for a potential Harris administration while taking aim at Trump for his \"hate\" that is \"poisoning the blood\" of America -- a reference to the ex-prez's previous comments on illegal immigration.\n\nEmhoff said Harris has proposed increasing the tax deduction for small businesses' startup expenses from $5,000 to $50,000. She also plans to oversee the construction of 3 million new housing units to lower living costs and include a $25,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers, per the second gentleman.\n\nOther speakers at Saturday's rally included Department of Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, hometown Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.) and Allentown Mayor Matt Tuerk, who introduced the Emhoff to the stage.\n\nCardona -- who spoke partially in Spanish to the many Latinos in attendance -- enthusiastically worked the crowd by rapping Black Sheep's \"The Choice Is Yours\" to contrast the records of Harris and Trump.\n\n\"You got one [candidate] that wants to fix the education system in Puerto Rico and fix the energy system, the grid in Puerto Rico,\" Cardona said of Harris, \"and then the other one throws paper towels into a crowd after a hurricane,\" he said of Trump. \"We haven't forgotten it.\"\n\nRally attendees told The Post they are concerned about a variety of issues, but excited to vote in-person on Election Day.\n\nMichele Bright, a 49-year-old commercial lender from nearby Easton, came out to support the Harris' campaign, citing women's rights as a key issue for her, but told The Post: \"We've gotta do something about the economy, the housing market and immigration,\" Bright said.\n\nAn Allentown man, 25-year-old Frederick Stevens, wanted to hear Emhoff and Cardona speak about education issues -- particularly as Allentown schools continue to struggle.\n\n\"Our schools are nationally underperforming. We need federal money, and we need to get the test scores so we can get the federal money,\" he told The Post.",

                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will meet for the first time face-to-face Tuesday night for perhaps their only debate, a high-pressure opportunity to showcase their starkly different visions for the country after a tumultuous campaign summer.\n\nThe event, at 9 p.m. Eastern in Philadelphia, will offer Americans their most detailed look at a campaign that's dramatically changed since the last debate in June. In rapid fashion, President Joe Biden bowed out of the race after his disastrous performance, Trump survived an assassination attempt, and both sides chose their running mates.\n\nHarris is intent on demonstrating that she can press the Democratic case against Trump better than Biden did. Trump, in turn, is trying to paint the vice president as an out-of-touch liberal while trying to win over voters skeptical he should return to the White House.\n\nTrump, 78, has struggled to adapt to Harris, 59, who is the first woman, Black person and person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president. The Republican former president has at times resorted to invoking racial and gender stereotypes, frustrating allies who want Trump to focus instead on policy differences with Harris.\n\nThe vice president, for her part, will try to claim a share of credit for the Biden administration's accomplishments while also addressing its low moments and explaining her shifts away from more liberal positions she took in the past.\n\nThe debate will subject Harris, who has sat for only a single formal interview in the past six weeks, to a rare moment of sustained questioning.\n\n\"If she performs great, it's going to be a nice surprise for the Democrats and they'll rejoice,\" said Ari Fleischer, a Republican communications strategist and former press secretary to President George W. Bush. \"If she flops, like Joe Biden did, it could break this race wide open. So there's more riding on it.\"\n\nTim Hogan, who led Sen. Amy Klobuchar's debate preparations in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, said Harris, a former California attorney general, would bring a \"prosecutor's instincts to the debate stage.\"\n\n\"That is a very strong quality in that setting: having someone who knows how to land a punch and how to translate it,\" Hogan said.\n\nThe first early ballots of the presidential race will go out just hours after the debate, hosted by ABC News. Absentee ballots are set to be sent out beginning Wednesday in Alabama.\n\nTrump and his campaign have spotlighted far-left positions she took during her failed 2020 presidential bid. He's been assisted in his informal debate prep sessions by Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate who tore into Harris during their primary debates.\n\nHarris has sought to defend her shifts away from liberal causes to more moderate stances on fracking, expanding Medicare for all and mandatory gun buyback programs -- and even backing away from her position that plastic straws should be banned -- as pragmatism, insisting that her \"values remain the same.\" Her campaign on Monday published a page on its website listing her positions on key issues.\n\nThe former president has argued a Harris presidency is a threat to the safety of the country, highlighting that Biden tapped her to address the influx of migrants as the Republican once again makes dark warnings about immigration and those in the country illegally central to his campaign. He has sought to portray a Harris presidency as the continuation of Biden's still-unpopular administration, particularly his economic record, as voters still feel the bite of inflation even as it has cooled in recent months.\n\nTrump's team insist his tone won't be any different facing a female opponent.\n\n\"President Trump is going to be himself,\" senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters during a phone call Monday.\n\nGabbard, who was also on the call, added that Trump \"respects women and doesn't feel the need to be patronizing or to speak to women in any other way than he would speak to a man.\"\n\nHis advisers suggest Harris has a tendency to express herself in a \"word salad\" of meaningless phrases, prompting Trump to say last week that his debate strategy was to \"let her talk.\"\n\nThe former president frequently plows into rambling remarks that detour from his policy points. He regularly makes false claims about the last election, attacks a lengthy list of enemies and opponents working against him, offers praise for foreign strongmen and comments about race, like his false claim in July that Harris recently \"happened to turn Black.\"\n\nThe vice president, who has been the Biden administration's most outspoken supporter of abortion access after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, is expected to focus on calling out Trump's inconsistencies around women's reproductive care, including his announcement that he will vote to protect Florida's six-week abortion ban in a statewide referendum this fall.\n\nHarris was also set to try to portray herself as a steadier hand to lead the nation and safeguard its alliances, as war rages in Ukraine more than two years after Russia's invasion and Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza drags on with no end in sight.\n\nShe is likely to warn that Trump presents a threat to democracy, from his attempts in 2020 to overturn his loss in the presidential election, spurring his angry supporters to attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, through comments he made as recently as last weekend. Trump on social media issued yet another message of retribution, threatening that if he wins he will jail \"those involved in unscrupulous behavior,\" including lawyers, political operatives, donors, voters and election officials.\n\nHarris has spent the better part of the last five days ensconced in debate preparations in Pennsylvania, where she participated in hours-long mock sessions with a Trump stand-in. Ahead of the debate, she told radio host Rickey Smiley that she was workshopping how to respond if Trump lies.\n\n\"There's no floor for him in terms of how low he will go,\" she said.\n\n___\n\nAP Polling Editor Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux in Washington and Associated Press writers Thomas Beaumont in Las Vegas, Bill Barrow in Atlanta and Josh Boak in Pittsburgh contributed to this report.",

                "body": "CHICAGO (AP) -- For Christopher Pugh, the 2020 election was a turning point.\n\nHe already distrusted the government. But as he watched Fox News coverage in the immediate aftermath of the election and read posts on Twitter, the social media platform now known as X, that distrust grew. He now believes the falsehood that the 2020 election was stolen and trusts few people other than former President Donald Trump to deliver him news about election results.\n\n\"I trust Donald Trump, not the government,\" said the 38-year-old Republican from Gulfport, Mississippi. \"That's it.\"\n\nWhile most Americans trust government-certified election results at least a \"moderate\" amount, Republicans are more likely to trust Trump and his campaign, according to a new survey from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and USAFacts. Americans also are heading into the November election with concerns about misinformation. Many have low trust that the information they receive from presidential candidates -- particularly Trump, but also Vice President Kamala Harris -- is based on factual information.\n\nTrump continues to lie about the outcome of the 2020 election, saying it was rigged against him even after dozens of his court challenges failed, reviews, recounts and audits in battleground states all affirmed President Joe Biden's win, and Trump's own attorney general said there was no evidence of widespread fraud. Despite no evidence of any widespread fraud, a 2023 poll found that most Republicans believe Biden was not legitimately elected president.\n\nAs Trump runs as the Republican candidate for the third time, he also is signaling that he can only lose through widespread fraud. Over the weekend he threatened to prosecute those \"involved in unscrupulous behavior\" this election should he win in November.\n\n\"The only way they can beat us is to cheat,\" Trump said at a Las Vegas rally in June.\n\nThe recent findings from the AP-NORC survey show that a significant chunk of Trump's supporters might be more inclined to believe what he says about the upcoming election results than they are to trust government certifications of election results.\n\nAbout two-thirds of Republicans trust Trump's campaign at least a moderate amount to provide accurate information about the results of the 2024 election, while only about half say the same about the official certifications of results, the survey found. By contrast, about 9 in 10 Democrats trust the government certification at least a moderate amount, and an overwhelming majority, 82%, also have at least a moderate amount of trust in Harris and her campaign.\n\nMost Americans -- around 7 in 10 -- trust the government certifications of election results at least a moderate amount, according to the survey. Majorities also trust national and local TV news networks, as well as local or national newspapers, to provide accurate information about the outcome of this year's presidential election.\n\nDanielle Almeida, a 45-year-old Democrat from Briarcliff Manor, New York, said she trusts government-certified election results and finds it alarming that some Americans don't.\n\n\"In order to have a democracy, we have to trust the system and the results of our elections,\" she said, adding that she thinks Trump \"does not care about fact-checking because he believes his supporters don't care, either.\"\n\nAmericans are less likely to trust the campaigns overall -- compared to sources such as the government and the media -- but they have a higher level of trust in Harris and her campaign than in Trump and his campaign to provide accurate information about the outcome of the election. About half have at least a \"moderate\" amount of trust in Harris and her campaign. By contrast, about 4 in 10 have at least a moderate amount of trust in Trump and his campaign.\n\nSome Republicans' distrust of election results started far before the 2020 election.\n\nRichard Baum, 60, a conservative independent from Odessa, Texas, said his suspicions began in the 2000 U.S. presidential race between George W. Bush and Al Gore. After Bush won by a slim margin, \"hanging chads\" became an unlikely symbol of a disputed presidential election as small anomalies common in elections ballooned into major national controversies.\n\n\"There was some stuff there that didn't seem right that made a lot of doubts in my mind about if you can trust the government,\" Baum said.\n\nBaum said he would trust election results only if voting took place on only a single day, early voting and mail-in ballots were banned and photo IDs were required at all polling places.\n\nMany Americans doubt the veracity of both presidential candidates' campaign messages, but skepticism about Trump's campaign is higher, the USAFacts/AP-NORC survey found.\n\nAbout 6 in 10 Americans believe that Trump's campaign messages are \"rarely\" or \"never\" based on factual information, compared to 45% who say that about Harris' campaign messages.\n\nMany Americans also say it's hard to discern fact from fiction when it comes to the candidates. Slightly less than half of Americans say it's \"very easy\" or \"somewhat easy\" to find factual information about the candidates and their positions, and only about one-third say it's easy to know if what candidates are saying is true or not.\n\nAbout 6 in 10 Americans say it's easy for them to understand the difference between fact and opinion when it comes to information about the upcoming presidential election, but only about 4 in 10 say it's easy to know whether information is true or not.\n\nAmericans are, however, more confident about factual information related to election logistics: About 7 in 10 Americans say it's easy to find information about how to register to vote, and about 6 in 10 say it's easy to find information about how to cast their ballot.\n\nMichele Martin, a 56-year-old Pennsylvania Democrat, said she is \"very concerned\" about misinformation from politicians but finds it much easier to access basic voter information.\n\n\"It's online. It's mailed to you. It's not hard to find,\" she said.\n\nAbout 8 in 10 Americans say that when it comes to getting information about the government, the spread of misinformation is a \"major problem.\" That is essentially unchanged from when the question was asked in 2020.\n\nLisa Kuda, a 57-year-old Republican from Palm Harbor, Florida, said she gets most of her news from social media and friends. She said she feels alienated from most news sources other than Fox News.\n\n\"Misinformation is everywhere,\" she said. \"It's really difficult to find information about candidates.\"\n\nWhen Americans see news about the election and want to find out whether it's true, 40% say they turn to an internet search first. Much smaller shares -- around 1 in 10 for each -- say they first check cable news, national TV news or social media.\n\nBaum, from Texas, said he finds it difficult to easily access information about candidates because he believes social media platforms \"are censoring conservative ideologies.\" He also doesn't trust Google and instead turns to conservative networks and podcasts such One America News and conservative podcasters to fact-check claims he's unsure about.\n\nAlmeida's process looks much different.

                "title": "Harris-Trump debate becomes the 2024 election's latest landmark event",
                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will meet for the first time face-to-face Tuesday night for perhaps their only debate, a high-pressure opportunity to showcase their starkly different visions for the country after a tumultuous campaign summer.\n\nThe event, at 9 p.m. Eastern in Philadelphia, will offer Americans their most detailed look at a campaign that's dramatically changed since the last debate in June. In rapid fashion, President Joe Biden bowed out of the race after his disastrous performance, Trump survived an assassination attempt and bothsides chose their running mates.\n\nHarris is intent on demonstrating that she can press the Democratic case against Trump better than Biden did. Trump, in turn, is trying to paint the vice president as an out-of-touch liberal while trying to win over voters skeptical he should return to the White House.\n\nTrump, 78, has struggled to adapt to Harris, 59, who is the first woman, Black person and person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president. The Republican former president has at times resorted to invoking racial and gender stereotypes, frustrating allies who want Trump to focus instead on policy differences with Harris.\n\nThe vice president, for her part, will try to claim a share of credit for the Biden administration's accomplishments while also addressing its low moments and explaining her shifts away from more liberal positions she took in the past.\n\nThe debate will subject Harris, who has sat for only a single formal interview in the past six weeks, to a rare moment of sustained questioning.\n\n\"If she performs great, it's going to be a nice surprise for the Democrats and they'll rejoice,\" said Ari Fleischer, a Republican communications strategist and former press secretary to President George W. Bush. \"If she flops, like Joe Biden did, it could break this race wide open. So there's more riding on it.\"\n\nTim Hogan, who led Sen. Amy Klobuchar's debate preparations in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, said Harris, a former California attorney general, would bring a \"prosecutor's instincts to the debate stage.\"\n\n\"That is a very strong quality in that setting: having someone who knows how to land a punch and how to translate it,\" Hogan said.\n\nThe first early ballots of the presidential race will go out just hours after the debate, hosted by ABC News. Absentee ballots are set to be sent out beginning Wednesday in Alabama.\n\nTrump and his campaign have spotlighted far-left positions she took during her failed 2020 presidential bid. He's been assisted in his informal debate prep sessions by Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate who tore into Harris during their primary debates.\n\nHarris has sought to defend her shifts away from liberal causes to more moderate stances on fracking, expanding Medicare for all and mandatory gun buyback programs -- and even backing away from her position that plastic straws should be banned -- as pragmatism, insisting that her \"values remain the same.\" Her campaign on Monday published a page on its website listing her positions on key issues.\n\nThe former president has argued a Harris presidency is a threat to the safety of the country, highlighting that Biden tapped her to address the influx of migrants as the Republican once again makes dark warnings about immigration and those in the country illegally central to his campaign. He has sought to portray a Harris presidency as the continuation of Biden's still-unpopular administration, particularly his economic record, as voters still feel the bite of inflation even as it has cooled in recent months.\n\nTrump's team insist his tone won't be any different facing a female opponent.\n\n\"President Trump is going to be himself,\" senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters during a phone call Monday.\n\nGabbard, who was also on the call, added that Trump \"respects women and doesn't feel the need to be patronizing or to speak to women in any other way than he would speak to a man.\"\n\nHis advisers suggest Harris has a tendency to express herself in a \"word salad\" of meaningless phrases, prompting Trump to say last week that his debate strategy was to \"let her talk.\"\n\nThe former president frequently plows into rambling remarks that detour from his policy points. He regularly makes false claims about the last election, attacks a lengthy list of enemies and opponents working against him, offers praise for foreign strongmen and comments about race, like his false claim in July that Harris recently \"happened to turn Black.\"\n\nThe vice president, who has been the Biden administration's most outspoken supporter of abortion access after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, is expected to focus on calling out Trump's inconsistencies around women's reproductive care, including his announcement that he will vote to protect Florida's six-week abortion ban in a statewide referendum this fall.\n\nHarris was also set to try to portray herself as a steadier hand to lead the nation and safeguard its alliances, as war rages in Ukraine more than two years after Russia's invasion and Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza drags on with no end in sight.\n\nShe is likely to warn that Trump presents a threat to democracy, from his attempts in 2020 to overturn his loss in the presidential election, spurring his angry supporters to attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, through comments he made as recently as last weekend. Trump on social media issued yet another message of retribution, threatening that if he wins he will jail \"those involved in unscrupulous behavior,\" including lawyers, political operatives, donors, voters and election officials.\n\nHarris has spent the better part of the last five days ensconced in debate preparations in Pennsylvania, where she participated in hours-long mock sessions with a Trump stand-in. Ahead of the debate, she told radio host Rickey Smiley that she was workshopping how to respond if Trump lies.\n\n\"There's no floor for him in terms of how low he will go,\" she said.\n\n___\n\nAP Polling Editor Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux in Washington and Associated Press writers Thomas Beaumont in Las Vegas, Bill Barrow in Atlanta and Josh Boak in Pittsburgh contributed to this report.",

                "body": "CHICAGO -- For Christopher Pugh, the 2020 election was a turning point.\n\nHe already distrusted the government. But as he watched Fox News coverage in the immediate aftermath of the election and read posts on Twitter, the social media platform now known as X, that distrust grew. He now believes the falsehood that the 2020 election was stolen and trusts few people other than former President Donald Trump to deliver him news about election results.\n\n\"I trust Donald Trump, not the government,\" said the 38-year-old Republican from Gulfport, Mississippi. \"That's it.\"\n\nWhile most Americans trust government-certified election results at least a \"moderate\" amount, Republicans are more likely to trust Trump and his campaign, according to a new survey from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and USAFacts. Americans also are heading into the November election with concerns about misinformation. Many have low trust that the information they receive from presidential candidates -- particularly Trump, but also Vice President Kamala Harris -- is based on factual information.\n\nTrump continues to lie about the outcome of the 2020 election, saying it was rigged against him even after dozens of his court challenges failed, reviews, recounts and audits in battleground states all affirmed President Joe Biden's win, and Trump's own attorney general said there was no evidence of widespread fraud. Despite no evidence of any widespread fraud, a 2023 poll found that most Republicans believe Biden was not legitimately elected president.\n\nAs Trump runs as the Republican candidate for the third time, he also is signaling that he can only lose through widespread fraud. Over the weekend he threatened to prosecute those \"involved in unscrupulous behavior\" this election should he win in November.\n\n\"The only way they can beat us is to cheat,\" Trump said at a Las Vegas rally in June.\n\nThe recent findings from the AP-NORC survey show that a significant chunk of Trump's supporters might be more inclined to believe what he says about the upcoming election results than they are to trust government certifications of election results.\n\nAbout two-thirds of Republicans trust Trump's campaign at least a moderate amount to provide accurate information about the results of the 2024 election, while only about half say the same about the official certifications of results, the survey found. By contrast, about 9 in 10 Democrats trust the government certification at least a moderate amount, and an overwhelming majority, 82%, also have at least a moderate amount of trust in Harris and her campaign.\n\nMost Americans -- around 7 in 10 -- trust the government certifications of election results at least a moderate amount, according to the survey. Majorities also trust national and local TV news networks, as well as local or national newspapers, to provide accurate information about the outcome of this year's presidential election.\n\nDanielle Almeida, a 45-year-old Democrat from Briarcliff Manor, New York, said she trusts government-certified election results and finds it alarming that some Americans don't.\n\n\"In order to have a democracy, we have to trust the system and the results of our elections,\" she said, adding that she thinks Trump \"does not care about fact-checking because he believes his supporters don't care, either.\"\n\nAmericans are less likely to trust the campaigns overall -- compared to sources such as the government and the media -- but they have a higher level of trust in Harris and her campaign than in Trump and his campaign to provide accurate information about the outcome of the election. About half have at least a \"moderate\" amount of trust in Harris and her campaign. By contrast, about 4 in 10 have at least a moderate amount of trust in Trump and his campaign.\n\nSome Republicans' distrust of election results started far before the 2020 election.\n\nRichard Baum, 60, a conservative independent from Odessa, Texas, said his suspicions began in the 2000 U.S. presidential race between George W. Bush and Al Gore. After Bush won by a slim margin, \"hanging chads\" became an unlikely symbol of a disputed presidential election as small anomalies common in elections ballooned into major national controversies.\n\n\"There was some stuff there that didn't seem right that made a lot of doubts in my mind about if you can trust the government,\" Baum said.\n\nBaum said he would trust election results only if voting took place on only a single day, early voting and mail-in ballots were banned and photo IDs were required at all polling places.\n\nMany Americans doubt the veracity of both presidential candidates' campaign messages, but skepticism about Trump's campaign is higher, the USAFacts/AP-NORC survey found.\n\nAbout 6 in 10 Americans believe that Trump's campaign messages are \"rarely\" or \"never\" based on factual information, compared to 45% who say that about Harris' campaign messages.\n\nMany Americans also say it's hard to discern fact from fiction when it comes to the candidates. Slightly less than half of Americans say it's \"very easy\" or \"somewhat easy\" to find factual information about the candidates and their positions, and only about one-third say it's easy to know if what candidates are saying is true or not.\n\nAbout 6 in 10 Americans say it's easy for them to understand the difference between fact and opinion when it comes to information about the upcoming presidential election, but only about 4 in 10 say it's easy to know whether information is true or not.\n\nAmericans are, however, more confident about factual information related to election logistics: About 7 in 10 Americans say it's easy to find information about how to register to vote, and about 6 in 10 say it's easy to find information about how to cast their ballot.\n\nMichele Martin, a 56-year-old Pennsylvania Democrat, said she is \"very concerned\" about misinformation from politicians but finds it much easier to access basic voter information.\n\n\"It's online. It's mailed to you. It's not hard to find,\" she said.\n\nAbout 8 in 10 Americans say that when it comes to getting information about the government, the spread of misinformation is a \"major problem.\" That is essentially unchanged from when the question was asked in 2020.\n\nLisa Kuda, a 57-year-old Republican from Palm Harbor, Florida, said she gets most of her news from social media and friends. She said she feels alienated from most news sources other than Fox News.\n\n\"Misinformation is everywhere,\" she said. \"It's really difficult to find information about candidates.\"\n\nWhen Americans see news about the election and want to find out whether it's true, 40% say they turn to an internet search first. Much smaller shares -- around 1 in 10 for each -- say they first check cable news, national TV news or social media.\n\nBaum, from Texas, said he finds it difficult to easily access information about candidates because he believes social media platforms \"are censoring conservative ideologies.\" He also doesn't trust Google and instead turns to conservative networks and podcasts such One America News and conservative podcasters to fact-check claims he's unsure about.\n\nAlmeida's process looks much different. She starts with a Google search and wades through multiple articles from news outlets such as The New York Times and NBC News, making note of any differences. If multiple articles have the same information, she said, she's more likely to trust it.\n\n\"Misinformation is a huge problem,\" she said. \"You have to take time to do your research.\"\n\n-- -- --",

                "body": "Washington -- Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are set to meet in Philadelphia on Tuesday for their first -- and perhaps only -- debate before the November presidential election.\n\nThe match-up will mark the first time Trump and Harris have met in person, and it comes at a crucial point in the election season. A new CBS News poll shows the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees locked in tight races in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin with less than 60 days until voters choose who will be the next president.\n\nHosted by ABC News, the debate was initially supposed to be the second meeting of Trump and President Biden, but Mr. Biden's decision in late July to bow out of the race set off a frenetic series of events that culminated with Harris accepting the Democratic presidential nomination at the party's convention last month.\n\nThe weeks leading up to the debate have seen the two sides sparring over the rules. Harris' campaign pushed for microphones to be on throughout the debate, while Trump said his campaign agreed to the same rules that were in place for the first face-off. When he and Mr. Biden met, microphones were active only when a candidate was speaking.\n\nMuted microphones ultimately prevailed after Harris' campaign accepted the rules set forth by ABC, though it warned she will be \"fundamentally disadvantaged\" by the format.\n\nThe debate is set to run 90 minutes and will be hosted by ABC's David Muir and Linsey Davis. Both candidates will stand behind podiums, and they cannot bring props or prewritten notes on stage, according to rules released by ABC. There will not be a public audience in the room. ABC is allowing other TV networks to simulcast the debate.\n\nHarris has spent the days leading up to the meeting in Pittsburgh, where she participated in extended mock debates. Trump, meanwhile, has been going over policy positions with advisers in the run-up to the event, though his preparations have been characterized as informal.\n\nThe ABC-hosted debate is the only one that both Harris and Trump have agreed to so far. The former president had proposed a total of three match-ups, with the other two hosted by Fox News and NBC News. But the vice president has only agreed to Tuesday's debate, while her campaign has indicated she would be open to one more in October. Trump has also suggested several times he may pull out of the ABC debate while criticizing its top hosts, though he appears poised to participate.",

                "body": "Washington DC [US], September 10 (ANI): Ahead of the US presidential elections this November, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are set to face off in their first debate in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday.\n\nThe debate will mark the first time that the Democratic and Republican candidate will meet in person and share a stage. The two will spar for 90 minutes in a setting, which will have no studio audience nor will the two be allowed to have pre-written notes or props. The two candidates will also not be permitted to question each other directly.\n\nAlso Read | Israel-Hamas War: IDF Strikes Hamas Command Centre in Khan Yunis.\n\nABC News outlet, which is moderating the debate, said the showdown is taking place months after the last debate ended President Joe Biden's re-election bid and catapulted Harris as the Democratic candidate.\n\nAs the countdown to Election Day reaches its final stretch, the stakes have never been higher. Tonight's highly anticipated debate will see the candidates grilled on the issues that matter most to voters, including the economy, immigration, and reproductive rights, as each tries to persuade millions of voters and viewers that they're the ones best suited to be president.\n\nAlso Read | Israel's Longest Undercover Operation With Agent 'Jack Sparrow' Exposes Smuggling, Tax Evasion, Money Laundering Network at Ashdod Port.\n\n\"I think there's an outsized expectation of 'gosh, the last guy dropped out, let's watch it.' So, I think that there's a lot more at stake than normally I would ever say is at stake,\" said Sean Spicer, Trump's first White House press secretary, as cited by ABC.\n\nTonight's highly anticipated debate promises to be a pivotal moment for Kamala Harris, as she faces intense scrutiny over the Biden administration's handling of contentious issues like border security and inflation. Moderators will likely push her to reconcile her current positions with the more liberal stances she took during her 2020 presidential campaign, including her recent shifts on fracking, border policy, and healthcare.\n\nDonald Trump, renowned for his capacity to dominate the political conversation and exploit his opponents' vulnerabilities, will likely seek to capitalize on his strengths on immigration and trade.\n\nAs Trump engages with Harris, he must tread carefully to avoid alienating female voters, among whom his support is already tenuous. If he comes across as condescending or dismissive, it could further erode his standing with this critical demographic. Harris, as the first woman of color to run for vice president on a major party ticket, presents a historic opportunity for the Democratic Party to connect with diverse voters and challenge Trump's divisive rhetoric.\n\nDemocrats who spoke to ABC News said that Harris has two main goals \"affirm to voters that she is ready to lead the country and the free world and to describe in more detail what policies she'd pursue as president.\"\n\nSimilarly, Republicans who spoke to ABC News said Trump should focus on policy contrasts, boasting that he has the edge on issues like inflation and immigration and can try to pin her down on her policy reversals on things like fracking - while he himself searches for consistent stances on issues like abortion.\n\nABC News said that Trump blamed the Biden-Harris administration's handling of the economy, saying their policies are to blame for inflation, which reached a 40-year high in 2022 but has since cooled to 2.9 per cent year-over-year as of July.\n\nTrump has pledged to cut costs by restoring \"energy independence\" through drilling more oil and lowering gas prices. He's also said he would reduce the national debt, eliminate regulations and implement a variety of tax cuts for domestic corporations as well as tariffs on foreign imports.\n\nHarris has presented an \"opportunity economy\" plan, which includes USD 25,000 in down-payment support for first-time homeowners, construction of 3 million new housing units, raising the minimum wage and a federal ban on corporate price-gouging on food and groceries.\n\nShe has also pitched a USD 50,000 tax benefit for new small businesses and a lower long-term capital gains tax of 28 per cent.\n\n\"World News Tonight\" anchor and managing editor David Muir and ABC News Live \"Prime\" anchor Linsey Davis will serve as moderators.\n\nIt's a big test for the Disney-owned network in the only scheduled debate between Harris and Trump in the 2024 race that could serve as a make-or-break moment for either campaign.\n\nSo while this debate could help set the political environment for the last two months of the 2024 presidential race, it also will be the last chance for the two candidates to reach some voters in states where every ballot matters.

                "body": "SHOWDOWN IN PHILADELPHIA: In what is their first, and may well be their only face-to-face showdown, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will square off at 9 p.m. in a tightly constrained 90-minute debate before an audience-free auditorium in Philadelphia's National Constitution Center. The candidates will answer questions in two-minute increments, and according to the rules, they are not supposed to question each other.\n\nThe debate comes as the latest New York Times and Siena College poll shows Trump has retaken a narrow but statistically insignificant lead over Harris, 48% to 47%, well with the three-percentage-point margin of error.\n\nHowever, the poll shows that Trump enjoys a clear edge in who voters believe would handle the issues they consider most important -- the economy, inflation, and immigration. When asked, \"Which candidate do you think would do a better job of handling the issue you think is most important?\" 50% said Trump, 45% said Harris.\n\nWhen asked to rank the issues, 22% said the economy, including jobs and the stock market, was the most important factor guiding their vote, with 12% picking immigration. Both were topics where Trump polled stronger. Harris has an edge on abortion, which 15% of voters said would decide who they voted for.\n\nForeign policy ranked ninth, with only 3% of voters surveyed saying it would factor into their decision, 2% citing the war in the Middle East, and fewer than one-half of 1% naming Ukraine's war with Russia.\n\nHARRIS AND TRUMP TO GET CORNERED ON POLICY AT PHILADELPHIA DEBATE\n\nBLAMING HARRIS FOR AFGHANISTAN: Republican efforts to hang the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan three years ago on Harris seems to be resonating with voters. On Monday, the House Foreign Affairs Committee released a highly critical report which concluded, among other things, \"The Biden-Harris administration's failure to plan for all contingencies, the U.S. government conducted an emergency evacuation without the necessary personnel, supplies, and equipment. The administration's dereliction of duty placed U.S. servicemembers and U.S. State Department personnel in mortal danger, where the Taliban - our sworn enemy - became the first line of defense.\"\n\n\"Harris has admitted in the past, and has gone on record to say she was the last to actually come into the room with regards to this Afghan botched withdrawal,\" Rep. Cory Mills (R-FL) said on Fox Business News yesterday. \"It was also made very clear by Gen. [Frank] McKenzie and former Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff, Gen. [Mark] Milley, that President Trump had actually, at the behest of his generals, had recommended for a smaller contingent force to remain behind when he realized that in the event of withdrawing civilians, that we would actually need to maintain a temporary military presence.\"\n\nThe New York Times Siena College poll shows 49% of voters believe Harris deserves some or \"a lot\" of blame for the disastrous withdrawal. The poll also indicates another Harris weakness: 63% of respondents say she shares blame for problems at the border.\n\nWHITE HOUSE PUSHBACK: Retired Rear Adm. John Kirby, who was the Pentagon's chief spokesman during the August 2021 withdrawal, delivered the administration's rebuttal to what it characterized as a highly partisan, one-sided account of the events leading up to the chaotic fall of Kabul.\n\n\"Clearly, there were moments of great violence, and there were moments of mission execution that didn't go exactly the way we wanted it to go,' Kirby said at yesterday's White House briefing. \"Nobody has walked away from that. But in the main, we were able to get 120,000-some-odd folks out of there safely with an airplane taking off about once every hour.\"\n\nBut he argued the die was cast when the Trump administration signed what amounted to articles of surrender with the Taliban in Qatar in February of 2020.\n\n\"The Trump administration cut a deal called the Doha Agreement that mandated a complete U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and, yes, that included Bagram Air Base by the end of May 2021. That deal also released 5,000 Taliban fighters from prison -- 5,000 fighters,\" Kirby said. \"As General Frank McKenzie, former commander of U.S. Central Command, said himself in testimony, the Doha -- Doha deal had a, quote, 'really pernicious effect,' unquote, on the Afghan government and military. As we saw, it demoralized them and disenfranchised them. They knew right then and there that America was on its way out.\"\n\n\"Indeed, in October of 2020, then-President Trump ordered his military to rush the exit from Afghanistan and have everybody leave by Christmas of that year,\" Kirby said. \"President Biden, for his part, faced a stark choice when he came to office: abide by the flawed agreement and end America's longest war or blow up the deal, extend the war, and see a much smaller contingent of American troops back in combat with the Taliban. He chose the former, and he was able to buy additional time to prepare for that withdrawal all the way into the summer.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP OR READ BACK ISSUES OF DAILY ON DEFENSE\n\nHAPPENING TODAY: This morning, right on time at 5:23 a.m. EDT, the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket took flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on a history-making first commercial flight carrying private citizens as astronauts on a five-day mission dubbed \"Polaris Dawn.\"\n\nThe crew includes billionaire Jared Isaacman, who is scheduled on Thursday to conduct the first private spacewalk on his second journey into space, as the spacecraft has carried humans farther into space than anyone since NASA's Apollo moonshots.\n\nU.S., CHINA COMMANDERS TALKING: President Joe Biden's meeting last November with Chinese President Xi Jinping has produced one tangible result: a slight crack in the icy relations between the two countries' militaries.\n\nYesterday, U.S. Indo-Pacific Commander Adm. Samuel Paparo talked face-to-face via video teleconference with Gen. Wu Yanan, the commander of the People's Liberation Army's Southern Theater Command.\n\n\"During the call, Paparo underscored the importance of sustained lines of communication between the U.S. military and the PLA, noting that such discussions between senior leaders serve to clarify intent and reduce the risk of misperception or miscalculation,\" the Indo-Pacific Command said in a press release. \"Citing several recent PLA unsafe interactions with U.S. allies, Paparo reinforced the PLA's obligation to comply with international laws and norms to ensure operational safety. Paparo also urged the PLA to reconsider its use of dangerous, coercive, and potentially escalatory tactics in the South China Sea and beyond.\"\n\n\"Gen. Wu and Paparo had a constructive and respectful exchange of views between experienced professionals,\" the release said. \"Paparo expressed hope that this discussion with his PLA counterpart would be the first of many such conversations.\"\n\nCHINA HAWKS IN CONGRESS KEEP PRESSURE ON WHILE SPENDING FIGHT DOMINATES DISCUSSIONS\n\nTHE FUTURE OF US TROOPS IN IRAQ: The U.S.-Iraq Higher Military Commission is charged with determining the future military relationship between the United States and Iraq. Currently, some 2,500 U.S. troops are assisting in the battle against ISIS.\n\nU.S. troops remain in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government, which has indicated it might be time for most of those troops to leave. \"The US-Iraq Higher Military Commission executive working group continues to have their discussions,\" spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Monday. \"I'm not going to get ahead of the HMC.\"\n\n\"As was clearly stated in the joint statement put out by the President and President Sudani, the two leaders reaffirmed that they would review the factors to determine when and how the mission of the global coalition in Iraq would end and transition in an orderly manner to our enduring bilateral security partnership in accordance with Iraq's constitution and the US-Iraq strategic commitment,\" Ryder said.\n\n\"We value the work that's being done via the Higher Military Commission process. Those conversations inform senior leader decisions, ultimately which rest at the seat of government, right? So, the president and the Iraqi leadership,\" Ryder said. \"I don't have any announcements to make in terms of any force posture adjustments at this time.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nTHE RUNDOWN:\n\nWashington Examiner: Tuberville blocks Pentagon nominee over role in Lloyd Austin's two-week absence\n\nWashington Examiner: 'Terrorgram' leaders indicted over plotting assassinations of public officials\n\nWashington Examiner: White House defensive on Israel ceasefire negotiations after Hamas changes terms\n\nWashington Examiner: House Democratic leadership blasts CR as those in favor of SAVE Act stay silent\n\nWashington Examiner: American once detained in Syria cherishes 'everything that's come from it'\n\nWashington Examiner: Florida crackdown on illegal immigrant farm workers hurting agriculture industry: Report\n\nWashington Examiner: Mother of daughter killed by MS-13 illegal immigrant brings fight to Washington\n\nWashington Examiner: Schumer and Jeffries to attend medal ceremony for 13 service members killed in Afghanistan\n\nWashington Examiner: Boeing and union reach tentative deal to avoid labor strike\n\nWashington Examiner: China hawks in Congress keep pressure on while spending fight dominates discussions\n\nNew York Times: Two Ukrainian Villages Reportedly Fall To Russia\n\nAP: Iran's Missiles Are A Legitimate Target, Ukraine Official Says\n\nAP: A woman is killed near Moscow as over 140 Ukrainian drones target Russia, officials say\n\nWall Street Journal: More Ukrainians Want To Negotiate An End To The War.

                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will meet for the first time face-to-face Tuesday night for perhaps their only debate, a high-pressure opportunity to showcase their starkly different visions for the country after a tumultuous campaign summer.\n\nThe event, at 9:00pm Eastern in Philadelphia, will offer Americans their most detailed look at a campaign that's dramatically changed since the last debate in June. In rapid fashion, President Joe Biden bowed out of the race after his disastrous performance, Trump survived an assassination attempt and bothsides chose their running mates.\n\nHarris is intent on demonstrating that she can press the Democratic case against Trump better than Biden did. Trump, in turn, is trying to paint the vice president as an out-of-touch liberal while trying to win over voters skeptical he should return to the White House.\n\nTrump, 78, has struggled to adapt to Harris, 59, who is the first woman, Black person and person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president. The Republican former president has at times resorted to invoking racial and gender stereotypes, frustrating allies who want Trump to focus instead on policy differences with Harris.\n\nThe vice president, for her part, will try to claim a share of credit for the Biden administration's accomplishments while also addressing its low moments and explaining her shifts away from more liberal positions she took in the past.\n\nThe debate will subject Harris, who has sat for only a single formal interview in the past six weeks, to a rare moment of sustained questioning.\n\n\"If she performs great, it's going to be a nice surprise for the Democrats and they'll rejoice,\" said Ari Fleischer, a Republican communications strategist and former press secretary to President George W. Bush. \"If she flops, like Joe Biden did, it could break this race wide open. So there's more riding on it.\"\n\nTim Hogan, who led Sen. Amy Klobuchar's debate preparations in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, said Harris, a former California attorney general, would bring a \"prosecutor's instincts to the debate stage.\"\n\n\"That is a very strong quality in that setting: having someone who knows how to land a punch and how to translate it,\" Hogan said.\n\nThe first early ballots of the presidential race will go out just hours after the debate, hosted by ABC News. Absentee ballots are set to be sent out beginning Wednesday in Alabama.\n\nTrump plans to hit Harris as too liberal\n\nTrump and his campaign have spotlighted far-left positions she took during her failed 2020 presidential bid. He's been assisted in his informal debate prep sessions by Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate who tore into Harris during their primary debates.\n\nHarris has sought to defend her shifts away from liberal causes to more moderate stances on fracking, expanding Medicare for all and mandatory gun buyback programs -- and even backing away from her position that plastic straws should be banned -- as pragmatism, insisting that her \"values remain the same.\" Her campaign on Monday published a page on its website listing her positions on key issues.\n\nThe former president has argued a Harris presidency is a threat to the safety of the country, highlighting that Biden tapped her to address the influx of migrants as the Republican once again makes dark warnings about immigration and those in the country illegally central to his campaign. He has sought to portray a Harris presidency as the continuation of Biden's still-unpopular administration, particularly his economic record, as voters still feel the bite of inflation even as it has cooled in recent months.\n\nTrump's team insist his tone won't be any different facing a female opponent.\n\n\"President Trump is going to be himself,\" senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters during a phone call Monday.\n\nGabbard, who was also on the call, added that Trump \"respects women and doesn't feel the need to be patronizing or to speak to women in any other way than he would speak to a man.\"\n\nHis advisers suggest Harris has a tendency to express herself in a \"word salad\" of meaningless phrases, prompting Trump to say last week that his debate strategy was to \"let her talk.\"\n\nThe former president frequently plows into rambling remarks that detour from his policy points. He regularly makes false claims about the last election, attacks a lengthy list of enemies and opponents working against him, offers praise for foreign strongmen and comments about race, like his false claim in July that Harris recently \"happened to turn Black.\"\n\nHarris wants to argue Trump is unstable and unfit\n\nThe vice president, who has been the Biden administration's most outspoken supporter of abortion access after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, is expected to focus on calling out Trump's inconsistencies around women's reproductive care, including his announcement that he will vote to protect Florida's six-week abortion ban in a statewide referendum this fall.\n\nHarris was also set to try to portray herself as a steadier hand to lead the nation and safeguard its alliances, as war rages in Ukraine more than two years after Russia's invasion and Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza drags on with no end in sight.\n\nShe is likely to warn that Trump presents a threat to democracy, from his attempts in 2020 to overturn his loss in the presidential election, spurring his angry supporters to attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, through comments he made as recently as last weekend. Trump on social media issued yet another message of retribution, threatening that if he wins he will jail \"those involved in unscrupulous behavior,\" including lawyers, political operatives, donors, voters and election officials.\n\nHarris has spent the better part of the last five days ensconced in debate preparations in Pennsylvania, where she participated in hours-long mock sessions with a Trump stand-in. Ahead of the debate, she told radio host Rickey Smiley that she was workshopping how to respond if Trump lies.\n\n\"There's no floor for him in terms of how low he will go,\" she said.\n\nAP Polling Editor Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux in Washington and Associated Press writers Thomas Beaumont in Las Vegas, Bill Barrow in Atlanta and Josh Boak in Pittsburgh contributed to this report.",

                "body": "WASHINGTON -- House Speaker Mike Johnson is hosting a ceremony Tuesday to posthumously present Congress' highest honor -- the Congressional Gold Medal -- to 13 U.S. service members who were killed during the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, even as the politics of a presidential election swirl around the event.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans supported the legislation to honor the 13 U.S. troops, who were killed along with more than 170 Afghans in a suicide bombing at Abbey Gate near Kabul's Airport in August 2021. President Joe Biden signed the legislation in December 2021. The top Republican and Democratic leaders for both the House and Senate are expected to speak at Tuesday's ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda.\n\nThe event is taking place against the backdrop of a bitter back and forth over who is to blame for the rushed and deadly evacuation from Kabul. Johnson scheduled the ceremony just hours before the first debate between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump.\n\nHouse Republicans also released a scathing investigation on Sunday into the withdrawal that cast blame on Biden's administration and minimized the role of Trump, who had signed the withdrawal deal with the Taliban.\n\nJohnson, a Louisiana Republican and Trump ally, praised the House report, which was led by the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Republican Rep. Michael McCaul.\n\n\"We must not allow the Biden-Harris Administration to rewrite history,\" Johnson said in a statement. \"The families of the 13 fallen servicemembers and the allies we abandoned in Afghanistan deserve better.\"\n\nWhite House national security spokesman John Kirby on Monday criticized the House report as partisan and one-sided, and said it revealed little new information as well as several inaccuracies. He noted that evacuation plans had started well before the pullout and the U.S. did not hand over equipment to the Taliban. He said the fall of Kabul \"moved a lot faster than anyone could have anticipated.\"\n\nHe also acknowledged that during the evacuation \"not everything went according to plan. Nothing ever does.\"\n\n\"We hold ourselves all accountable for that,\" he said of the deaths.\n\nKirby added there would be \"quite a few\" people from the Department of Defense at the ceremony Tuesday.\n\nThe top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, also issued a memorandum in response to the GOP report, saying he was concerned by the \"attempts to politicize the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.\"\n\n\"Republicans' partisan attempts to garner headlines rather than acknowledge the full facts and substance of their investigation have only increased with the heat of an election season,\" Meeks said.\n\nPentagon reviews have concluded that the suicide bombing was not preventable, and that suggestions troops may have seen the would-be bomber were not true.\n\nRegardless, Trump has thrust the withdrawal, with the backing from some of the families of the Americans killed, into the center of his campaign. Last month, his political team distributed video of him attending a wreath-laying ceremony for the fallen service members at Arlington National Cemetery on the third anniversary of the bombing, despite the cemetery's prohibition on partisan activity on the grounds as well as an altercation with a cemetery employee who was trying to make sure the campaign followed those rules.\n\nThe Gold Star military families who invited him to the Arlington ceremony have defended Trump's actions. At a fiery news conference outside the Capitol Monday, they implored for the House report to be taken seriously and demanded accountability for those in leadership during evacuation from Kabul.\n\n\"President Trump is certainly not perfect. But he's a far better choice, in my opinion, than the mess that Biden and Harris have created since Kabul,\" said Paula Knauss Selph, whose son Ryan Knauss died in the Abbey Gate attack.\n\nWhile Trump and Republicans have sought to link Harris to the withdrawal as a campaign issue, and Harris has said she was the last person in the room when Biden made his decision, neither watchdog reviews nor the 18-month investigation by House Republicans have identified any instance where the vice president had a significant impact on decision-making.\n\nStill, House Republicans argued that Harris, as well as Biden's national security team, needed to face accountability for the consequences of the deadly withdrawal.\n\n\"Kamala Harris wants to be the president of the United States. She wants to be commander in chief. She needs to answer for this report immediately,\" said Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican on the committee.\n\nMcCaul, the chairman, also defended the timing of the report by saying that the committee's investigation had to overcome resistance from the Biden administration.\n\nHe cast the investigation as a \"truth-seeking mission\" rather than a partisan endeavor, but also bragged that out of all the investigations that House Republicans have launched into the Biden administration in the last two years \"this investigation is the one they fear the most.\"\n\nMost assessments have concluded Trump and Biden share blame for the disastrous end to America's longest war, which saw enemy Taliban take over Afghanistan again before the last American troops even flew out of the Kabul airport. The main U.S. government watchdog for the war points to Trump's 2020 deal with the Taliban to withdraw all U.S. forces and military contractors as \"the single most important factor\" in the collapse of U.S.-allied Afghan security forces and Taliban takeover.\n\nBiden's April 2021 announcement that he would proceed with the withdrawal set in motion by Trump was the second-biggest factor, the watchdog said.\n\nBoth Trump and Biden kept up the staged withdrawal of U.S. forces, and in Trump's case sharply cut back important U.S. airstrikes in the Taliban, even though the Taliban failed to enter into substantive negotiations with the U.S.-backed civilian government as required by Trump's withdrawal deal.",

Both are hoping to make gains with as many voters as possible in a race that is shaping up to be decided by just tens of thousands of votes spread across a handful of swing states.\n\nIt will be Trump's second debate of this cycle, having debated President Joe Biden in June in an event that ended up costing him his reelection campaign after a poor performance rattled Democratic confidence in the president's ability to win. But his opponent this time around will be much different than Biden, who at times struggled to string together sentences and forcefully rebut Trump's talking points.\n\nHarris has been preparing for the debate for more than a week and is expected to mount a much fiercer defense against Trump's attacks over the economy, immigration and other issues he is seeking to capitalize on.\n\n\"Now that her honeymoon is over, the debate will be the first time Kamala will answer tough questions. In doing so, Kamala Harris will be revealed to America as a Radical Left lunatic,\" Trump campaign advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles wrote in a memo on Monday.\n\nHarris' campaign has said she is the underdog in the race, though most polling indicates it is essentially tied and falls into the margin of error on each sample. They have also tried to build up Trump's reputation as an experienced debater, noting that he has participated in more presidential debates than any other candidate in history as he has been the Republican nominee for three consecutive cycles.\n\nThe debate starts at 9 p.m. ET. It can be viewed on ABC on TV or streaming online.",

                "title": "The Harris-Trump debate becomes the 2024 election's latest landmark event",
                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will meet for the first time face-to-face Tuesday night for perhaps their only debate, a high-pressure opportunity to showcase their starkly different visions for the country after a tumultuous campaign summer.\n\nThe event, at 9 p.m. Eastern in Philadelphia, will offer Americans their most detailed look at a campaign that's dramatically changed since the last debate in June. In rapid fashion, President Joe Biden bowed out of the race after his disastrous performance, Trump survived an assassination attempt, and both sides chose their running mates.\n\nHarris is intent on demonstrating that she can press the Democratic case against Trump better than Biden did. Trump, in turn, is trying to paint the vice president as an out-of-touch liberal while trying to win over voters skeptical he should return to the White House.\n\nTrump, 78, has struggled to adapt to Harris, 59, who is the first woman, Black person and person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president. The Republican former president has at times resorted to invoking racial and gender stereotypes, frustrating allies who want Trump to focus instead on policy differences with Harris.\n\nThe vice president, for her part, will try to claim a share of credit for the Biden administration's accomplishments while also addressing its low moments and explaining her shifts away from more liberal positions she took in the past.\n\nThe debate will subject Harris, who has sat for only a single formal interview in the past six weeks, to a rare moment of sustained questioning.\n\n\"If she performs great, it's going to be a nice surprise for the Democrats and they'll rejoice,\" said Ari Fleischer, a Republican communications strategist and former press secretary to President George W. Bush. \"If she flops, like Joe Biden did, it could break this race wide open. So there's more riding on it.\"\n\nTim Hogan, who led Sen. Amy Klobuchar's debate preparations in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, said Harris, a former California attorney general, would bring a \"prosecutor's instincts to the debate stage.\"\n\n\"That is a very strong quality in that setting: having someone who knows how to land a punch and how to translate it,\" Hogan said.\n\nThe first early ballots of the presidential race will go out just hours after the debate, hosted by ABC News. Absentee ballots are set to be sent out beginning Wednesday in Alabama.\n\nTrump and his campaign have spotlighted far-left positions she took during her failed 2020 presidential bid. He's been assisted in his informal debate prep sessions by Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate who tore into Harris during their primary debates.\n\nHarris has sought to defend her shifts away from liberal causes to more moderate stances on fracking, expanding Medicare for all and mandatory gun buyback programs -- and even backing away from her position that plastic straws should be banned -- as pragmatism, insisting that her \"values remain the same.\" Her campaign on Monday published a page on its website listing her positions on key issues.\n\nThe former president has argued a Harris presidency is a threat to the safety of the country, highlighting that Biden tapped her to address the influx of migrants as the Republican once again makes dark warnings about immigration and those in the country illegally central to his campaign. He has sought to portray a Harris presidency as the continuation of Biden's still-unpopular administration, particularly his economic record, as voters still feel the bite of inflation even as it has cooled in recent months.\n\nTrump's team insist his tone won't be any different facing a female opponent.\n\n\"President Trump is going to be himself,\" senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters during a phone call Monday.\n\nGabbard, who was also on the call, added that Trump \"respects women and doesn't feel the need to be patronizing or to speak to women in any other way than he would speak to a man.\"\n\nHis advisers suggest Harris has a tendency to express herself in a \"word salad\" of meaningless phrases, prompting Trump to say last week that his debate strategy was to \"let her talk.\"\n\nThe former president frequently plows into rambling remarks that detour from his policy points. He regularly makes false claims about the last election, attacks a lengthy list of enemies and opponents working against him, offers praise for foreign strongmen and comments about race, like his false claim in July that Harris recently \"happened to turn Black.\"\n\nThe vice president, who has been the Biden administration's most outspoken supporter of abortion access after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, is expected to focus on calling out Trump's inconsistencies around women's reproductive care, including his announcement that he will vote to protect Florida's six-week abortion ban in a statewide referendum this fall.\n\nHarris was also set to try to portray herself as a steadier hand to lead the nation and safeguard its alliances, as war rages in Ukraine more than two years after Russia's invasion and Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza drags on with no end in sight.\n\nShe is likely to warn that Trump presents a threat to democracy, from his attempts in 2020 to overturn his loss in the presidential election, spurring his angry supporters to attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, through comments he made as recently as last weekend. Trump on social media issued yet another message of retribution, threatening that if he wins he will jail \"those involved in unscrupulous behavior,\" including lawyers, political operatives, donors, voters and election officials.\n\nHarris has spent the better part of the last five days ensconced in debate preparations in Pennsylvania, where she participated in hours-long mock sessions with a Trump stand-in. Ahead of the debate, she told radio host Rickey Smiley that she was workshopping how to respond if Trump lies.\n\n\"There's no floor for him in terms of how low he will go,\" she said.\n\nAP Polling Editor Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux in Washington and Associated Press writers Thomas Beaumont in Las Vegas, Bill Barrow in Atlanta and Josh Boak in Pittsburgh contributed to this report.",

                "title": "The Harris-Trump debate becomes the 2024 election's latest landmark event",
                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will meet for the first time face-to-face Tuesday night for perhaps their only debate, a high-pressure opportunity to showcase their starkly different visions for the country after a tumultuous campaign summer.\n\nThe event, at 9 p.m. Eastern in Philadelphia, will offer Americans their most detailed look at a campaign that's dramatically changed since the last debate in June. In rapid fashion, President Joe Biden bowed out of the race after his disastrous performance, Trump survived an assassination attempt, and both sides chose their running mates.\n\nHarris is intent on demonstrating that she can press the Democratic case against Trump better than Biden did. Trump, in turn, is trying to paint the vice president as an out-of-touch liberal while trying to win over voters skeptical he should return to the White House.\n\nTrump, 78, has struggled to adapt to Harris, 59, who is the first woman, Black person and person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president. The Republican former president has at times resorted to invoking racial and gender stereotypes, frustrating allies who want Trump to focus instead on policy differences with Harris.\n\nThe vice president, for her part, will try to claim a share of credit for the Biden administration's accomplishments while also addressing its low moments and explaining her shifts away from more liberal positions she took in the past.\n\nThe debate will subject Harris, who has sat for only a single formal interview in the past six weeks, to a rare moment of sustained questioning.\n\n\"If she performs great, it's going to be a nice surprise for the Democrats and they'll rejoice,\" said Ari Fleischer, a Republican communications strategist and former press secretary to President George W. Bush. \"If she flops, like Joe Biden did, it could break this race wide open. So there's more riding on it.\"\n\nTim Hogan, who led Sen. Amy Klobuchar's debate preparations in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, said Harris, a former California attorney general, would bring a \"prosecutor's instincts to the debate stage.\"\n\n\"That is a very strong quality in that setting: having someone who knows how to land a punch and how to translate it,\" Hogan said.\n\nThe first early ballots of the presidential race will go out just hours after the debate, hosted by ABC News. Absentee ballots are set to be sent out beginning Wednesday in Alabama.\n\nTrump and his campaign have spotlighted far-left positions she took during her failed 2020 presidential bid. He's been assisted in his informal debate prep sessions by Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate who tore into Harris during their primary debates.\n\nHarris has sought to defend her shifts away from liberal causes to more moderate stances on fracking, expanding Medicare for all and mandatory gun buyback programs -- and even backing away from her position that plastic straws should be banned -- as pragmatism, insisting that her \"values remain the same.\" Her campaign on Monday published a page on its website listing her positions on key issues.\n\nThe former president has argued a Harris presidency is a threat to the safety of the country, highlighting that Biden tapped her to address the influx of migrants as the Republican once again makes dark warnings about immigration and those in the country illegally central to his campaign. He has sought to portray a Harris presidency as the continuation of Biden's still-unpopular administration, particularly his economic record, as voters still feel the bite of inflation even as it has cooled in recent months.\n\nTrump's team insist his tone won't be any different facing a female opponent.\n\n\"President Trump is going to be himself,\" senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters during a phone call Monday.\n\nGabbard, who was also on the call, added that Trump \"respects women and doesn't feel the need to be patronizing or to speak to women in any other way than he would speak to a man.\"\n\nHis advisers suggest Harris has a tendency to express herself in a \"word salad\" of meaningless phrases, prompting Trump to say last week that his debate strategy was to \"let her talk.\"\n\nThe former president frequently plows into rambling remarks that detour from his policy points. He regularly makes false claims about the last election, attacks a lengthy list of enemies and opponents working against him, offers praise for foreign strongmen and comments about race, like his false claim in July that Harris recently \"happened to turn Black.\"\n\nThe vice president, who has been the Biden administration's most outspoken supporter of abortion access after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, is expected to focus on calling out Trump's inconsistencies around women's reproductive care, including his announcement that he will vote to protect Florida's six-week abortion ban in a statewide referendum this fall.\n\nHarris was also set to try to portray herself as a steadier hand to lead the nation and safeguard its alliances, as war rages in Ukraine more than two years after Russia's invasion and Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza drags on with no end in sight.\n\nShe is likely to warn that Trump presents a threat to democracy, from his attempts in 2020 to overturn his loss in the presidential election, spurring his angry supporters to attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, through comments he made as recently as last weekend. Trump on social media issued yet another message of retribution, threatening that if he wins he will jail \"those involved in unscrupulous behavior,\" including lawyers, political operatives, donors, voters and election officials.\n\nHarris has spent the better part of the last five days ensconced in debate preparations in Pennsylvania, where she participated in hours-long mock sessions with a Trump stand-in. Ahead of the debate, she told radio host Rickey Smiley that she was workshopping how to respond if Trump lies.\n\n\"There's no floor for him in terms of how low he will go,\" she said.\n\n___\n\nAP Polling Editor Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux in Washington and Associated Press writers Thomas Beaumont in Las Vegas, Bill Barrow in Atlanta and Josh Boak in Pittsburgh contributed to this report.",

                "title": "A 'Minnesota nice' race for 3rd District's open congressional seat",
                "body": "WASHINGTON -- An open congressional seat is a rarity in politics and usually results in bitter, highly competitive races because it's the best way to win a seat in Congress.\n\nBut the Minnesota 3 Congressional District race between state Sen. Kelly Morrison, a Democrat, and Tad Jude, a former judge and Republican state legislator, is bucking that trend.\n\nTwo-thirds of members of Congress enter the U.S. House through an open seat, like the one vacated by Rep. Dean Phillips, the Democrat who currently represents the 3. Phillips decided against re-election after his failed bid to challenge President Biden.\n\nYet the race for the 3 has been decidedly low-keyed. There have been no attack ads - or ads of any kind - on television, at least not yet, no mudslinging and no involvement by the national parties or outside groups in this contest. That's especially unique in a year of mean-spirited, bare knuckled hyper partisanship.\n\nThe 3 District race is characterized by civility, house parties, boots-on-the-ground campaigning and a lot of door-knocking. Morrison said there's \"less mudslinging and more talk about policy solutions\" in the race. Jude,72, said the toughest competition is the \"sign war,\" with the rival campaigns vying to put up the most yard signs and keeping them up.\n\nAn open seat usually provokes much fiercer fighting, said Hamline University political science professor David Schultz.\n\n\"Open congressional seats are really scarce,\" he said. He called the comparatively quiet nature of the races \"an anomaly.\"\n\nThat may be because the voting pattern has shifted so much in the 3 Congressional District, which was once represented for decades by a Republican and is now considered \"solid Democrat\" by the Cook Political Report and other analysts.\n\nBoth candidates have experienced running for public office and both say they adhere to the moderate wing of their respective parties.\n\n\"There is a long tradition of having moderate, bipartisan legislators in this seat,\" said Morrison, who touts her bipartisan work in the state legislature.\n\nMeanwhile, Jude, who lives in Maple Grove, said he would join the centrist and bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus if elected to Congress.\n\nPhillips is a member of that caucus of moderate Democrats and Republicans. When he was elected in 2018, Phillips defeated six-term Republican incumbent Erik Paulsen, who sometimes broke with his party and kept his distance from Donald Trump.\n\nBut by the time Paulsen lost his seat, the 3 Congressional District, which encompasses the suburbs north, east and south of Minneapolis, had for some time been drifting towards the Democratic Party.\n\nIn 2012, the district went narrowly for Barack Obama. In 2016 it went by a much larger margin for Hillary Clinton and in 2020 by an even larger margin for Joe Biden.\n\n\"What a lot of Republicans are concluding now is that this is a Democratic district and basically they are conceding,\" Schultz said.\n\nWhile both tout their moderation, there are sharp differences between the candidates.\n\nMorrison, 55, who lives in Deephaven with her husband and two children, is a gynecologist-obstetrician who hopes her pro-choice message resonates in the suburban 3 District. She said she decided to trade medicine for politics when Trump was elected in 2016 and she was concerned about the \"divisiveness\" of his politics.\n\nAfter Trump nominated Amy Coney Barrett, a critic of Roe v. Wade, to the U.S. Supreme Court, Morrison reacted again, co-founding the Reproductive Rights Caucus in the state legislature. She said she was ready to do battle when the Supreme Court overturned Roe two years ago with its Dobbs v. Jackson decision.\n\nMorrison said her \"particular skill set\" as an OB-GYN who supports reproductive rights \"kind of fits the ethics of the 3 District,\" which is home to many higher income households and where slightly more than half of its adult residents have bachelor's or advanced degrees.\n\nShe said she admires Phillips and his optimistic ethics of \"radical hospitality.\" She's known Phillips for decades, having been in his class at The Blake School, a private preparatory high school in Minneapolis. While Morrison said although Phillips is pro choice, the struggle for abortion rights \"isn't his focus.\"\n\nJude, meanwhile, supports former president Trump and the Supreme Court's Dodd decision, which allowed individual states to set their own abortion policy. Since the decision was handed down, 14 states have enacted near-total abortion bans, while four states - Georgia, South Carolina, Florida and Iowa -have banned abortion past roughly six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAnother big difference is in their campaign fundraising. Morrison has raised nearly $1.4 million and Jude about $163,000.\n\nA lawyer with a long career in public service, Jude was the youngest candidate, when at 20 years old he won a seat in the Minnesota House in 1972. He has also served as a state senator, a Hennepin County commissioner and a district court judge.\n\n\"I enjoy public service, but I really enjoy solving problems,\" he said.\n\nOne example he gave was his successful effort to derail proposed landfills in Hennepin County as a county commissioner, \"which saved our air and water quality.\"\n\nJude said he would take his problem-solving skills to Congress and focus on reining in government spending and undocumented migration as well as legislation that would limit the authority of the White House and federal agencies.\n\n\"You should have policies created by elected representatives, not bureaucrats,\" he said.\n\nAs far as the \"Walz factor,\" Jude shrugged off the impact of having the governor at the top of the ballot.\n\n\"The highly educated voters of the 3 District are more likely than others to split their ticket,\" he said.\n\nSchultz, however, said the presence of Walz, as well as Vice President Kamala Harris and Sen. Amy Klobuchar on the ballot will help Democrats like Morrison because it will get the Democratic vote out and win over independents.\n\n\"This is the best ticket for Democrats right now,\" he said.",

                "body": "PHILADELPHIA (TND) -- Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will take the stage Tuesday night for their first and potentially only debate against each other in an election running on razor-thin margins with less than two months left before Election Day.\n\nThe stakes are high for Trump and Harris as voters in some states will be able to start casting early ballots in a handful of states and Election Day is only 56 days away. Both are hoping to make gains with as many voters as possible in a race that is shaping up to be decided by just tens of thousands of votes spread across a handful of swing states.\n\nIt will be Trump's second debate of this cycle, having debated President Joe Biden in June in an event that ended up costing him his reelection campaign after a poor performance rattled Democratic confidence in the president's ability to win. But his opponent this time around will be much different than Biden, who at times struggled to string together sentences and forcefully rebut Trump's talking points.\n\nHarris has been preparing for the debate for more than a week and is expected to mount a much fiercer defense against Trump's attacks over the economy, immigration and other issues he is seeking to capitalize on.\n\n\"Now that her honeymoon is over, the debate will be the first time Kamala will answer tough questions. In doing so, Kamala Harris will be revealed to America as a Radical Left lunatic,\" Trump campaign advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles wrote in a memo on Monday.\n\nHarris' campaign has said she is the underdog in the race, though most polling indicates it is essentially tied and falls into the margin of error on each sample. They have also tried to build up Trump's reputation as an experienced debater, noting that he has participated in more presidential debates than any other candidate in history as he has been the Republican nominee for three consecutive cycles.\n\nThe debate starts at 9 p.m. ET. It can be viewed on ABC on TV or streaming online.",

                "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will meet for the first time face-to-face Tuesday night for perhaps their only debate, a high-pressure opportunity to showcase their starkly different visions for the country after a tumultuous campaign summer.\n\nThe event, at 9 p.m. Eastern in Philadelphia, will offer Americans their most detailed look at a campaign that's dramatically changed since the last debate in June. In rapid fashion, President Joe Biden bowed out of the race after his disastrous performance, Trump survived an assassination attempt and bothsides chose their running mates.\n\nHarris is intent on demonstrating that she can press the Democratic case against Trump better than Biden did. Trump, in turn, is trying to paint the vice president as an out-of-touch liberal while trying to win over voters skeptical he should return to the White House.\n\nTrump, 78, has struggled to adapt to Harris, 59, who is the first woman, Black person and person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president. The Republican former president has at times resorted to invoking racial and gender stereotypes, frustrating allies who want Trump to focus instead on policy differences with Harris.\n\nThe vice president, for her part, will try to claim a share of credit for the Biden administration's accomplishments while also addressing its low moments and explaining her shifts away from more liberal positions she took in the past.\n\nThe debate will subject Harris, who has sat for only a single formal interview in the past six weeks, to a rare moment of sustained questioning.\n\n\"If she performs great, it's going to be a nice surprise for the Democrats and they'll rejoice,\" said Ari Fleischer, a Republican communications strategist and former press secretary to President George W. Bush. \"If she flops, like Joe Biden did, it could break this race wide open. So there's more riding on it.\"\n\nTim Hogan, who led Sen. Amy Klobuchar's debate preparations in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, said Harris, a former California attorney general, would bring a \"prosecutor's instincts to the debate stage.\"\n\n\"That is a very strong quality in that setting: having someone who knows how to land a punch and how to translate it,\" Hogan said.\n\nThe first early ballots of the presidential race will go out just hours after the debate, hosted by ABC News. Absentee ballots are set to be sent out beginning Wednesday in Alabama.\n\nTrump plans to hit Harris as too liberal\n\nTrump and his campaign have spotlighted far-left positions she took during her failed 2020 presidential bid. He's been assisted in his informal debate prep sessions by Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate who tore into Harris during their primary debates.\n\nHarris has sought to defend her shifts away from liberal causes to more moderate stances on fracking, expanding Medicare for all and mandatory gun buyback programs -- and even backing away from her position that plastic straws should be banned -- as pragmatism, insisting that her \"values remain the same.\" Her campaign on Monday published a page on its website listing her positions on key issues.\n\nThe former president has argued a Harris presidency is a threat to the safety of the country, highlighting that Biden tapped her to address the influx of migrants as the Republican once again makes dark warnings about immigration and those in the country illegally central to his campaign. He has sought to portray a Harris presidency as the continuation of Biden's still-unpopular administration, particularly his economic record, as voters still feel the bite of inflation even as it has cooled in recent months.\n\nTrump's team insist his tone won't be any different facing a female opponent.\n\n\"President Trump is going to be himself,\" senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters during a phone call Monday.\n\nGabbard, who was also on the call, added that Trump \"respects women and doesn't feel the need to be patronizing or to speak to women in any other way than he would speak to a man.\"\n\nHis advisers suggest Harris has a tendency to express herself in a \"word salad\" of meaningless phrases, prompting Trump to say last week that his debate strategy was to \"let her talk.\"\n\nThe former president frequently plows into rambling remarks that detour from his policy points. He regularly makes false claims about the last election, attacks a lengthy list of enemies and opponents working against him, offers praise for foreign strongmen and comments about race, like his false claim in July that Harris recently \"happened to turn Black.\"\n\nThe vice president, who has been the Biden administration's most outspoken supporter of abortion access after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, is expected to focus on calling out Trump's inconsistencies around women's reproductive care, including his announcement that he will vote to protect Florida's six-week abortion ban in a statewide referendum this fall.\n\nHarris was also set to try to portray herself as a steadier hand to lead the nation and safeguard its alliances, as war rages in Ukraine more than two years after Russia's invasion and Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza drags on with no end in sight.\n\nShe is likely to warn that Trump presents a threat to democracy, from his attempts in 2020 to overturn his loss in the presidential election, spurring his angry supporters to attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, through comments he made as recently as last weekend. Trump on social media issued yet another message of retribution, threatening that if he wins he will jail \"those involved in unscrupulous behavior,\" including lawyers, political operatives, donors, voters and election officials.\n\nHarris has spent the better part of the last five days ensconced in debate preparations in Pennsylvania, where she participated in hours-long mock sessions with a Trump stand-in. Ahead of the debate, she told radio host Rickey Smiley that she was workshopping how to respond if Trump lies.\n\n\"There's no floor for him in terms of how low he will go,\" she said.\n\n___\n\nAP Polling Editor Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux in Washington and Associated Press writers Thomas Beaumont in Las Vegas, Bill Barrow in Atlanta and Josh Boak in Pittsburgh contributed to this report.\n\nMichelle L.

                "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump square off Tuesday at what could be their only presidential debate, setting high stakes for an event expected to be viewed by millions of Americans and a key sliver of undecided voters.\n\nHarris' momentum -- after her unusual rise as the Democrats' nominee shot her into a neck-and-neck race -- has now stalled, making the head-to-head matchup an opportunity to get that started again f she can adequately make the argument for her own candidacy and cast Trump as unfit for another term.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has struggled to find a way to consistently and effectively attack his new opponent but has remained highly competitive, thanks to a large base of immovable supporters and the broad swath of Americans who already have fixed views of him. Tuesday's debate offers him an opportunity to solidify his support while painting Harris in a negative light to an electorate that has less cemented perceptions of her.\n\nThe ABC News debate, moderated by David Muir and Linsey Davis, will take place on Tuesday, Sept. 10 at 9 p.m ET. A prime-time pre-debate special will air at 8 p.m. ET. It will air on ABC and stream on ABC News Live, Disney+ and Hulu. Viewers can also stream the debate on the ABC app on a smartphone or tablet, on ABC.com and connected devices.\n\nTrump has worked to peg Harris as a \"California liberal,\" letting voters' perceptions of the progressive bastion paint a picture of a candidate who served as the state's attorney general and junior senator. He's also hammered her on immigration and inflation -- two voter concerns on which polls suggest he has an edge.\n\nHowever, he's also veered into personal remarks, including falsely questioning Harris' racial identity (she's Black and south Asian), touting what he says are his superior good looks and promoting vulgar and false allegations that past romantic relationships of Harris' helped propel her political career.\n\nStaying on message on his four-year economic record, which saw low inflation before the pandemic and less fervor over unauthorized border crossings, is key, allies told ABC News.\n\nVeering into personal attacks would be counterproductive, they argued, drawing media attention away from what they view as a favorable policy issue set.\n\n\"I think he does,\" former White House press secretary Sean Spicer said when asked if Trump makes an effective contrast on the trail. \"If I had a critique, it would be that he'll make the case sometimes and then, with all due respect, he will sometimes go beyond the case and give the media something else to focus on.\"\n\n\"He needs to avoid creating a moment that takes the focus away from her record. So, if it's about her personality or her appearance as opposed to her record, that will change the focus of what people talk about the next day.\"\n\nWhile Trump comes in with nearly universal name recognition, 28% of likely voters in a recent New York Times/Siena College poll said they feel they \"need to learn more about Kamala Harris.\" That means that while many voters have heard of Harris, she is less defined than Trump in their eyes and thus has more work to do to introduce herself -- lest she be defined by her opposition.\n\nHarris has dual goals in Tuesday's debate: make the case for herself as someone who would be a capable president and get under Trump's skin to spark a reaction to suggest he isn't worthy of another four years in the White House.\n\n\"I think there needs to be a long litany of just pummeling Donald Trump while also being extremely clear about what your vision is for the future,\" said Bakari Sellers, a prominent Harris ally and Democratic media commentator.\n\nHarris on the trail has sought to do both.\n\nMonday, she fleshed out her policy proposals in a new page on her website, her most expansive explanation yet of her platform. And in early stump speeches, she boasted of her time working as a prosecutor and state attorney general combating gangs and other criminal activity, saying to crowds that she knows \"Donald Trump's type,\" in a clear reference to his legal travails.\n\nThey way she balances those two dictates could offer clues as to the way she and her campaign best think she can march to victory in November.\n\nHarris had a memorable debate performance in 2020, when she faced off against then-Vice President Mike Pence. Pence was muscling in on her answers, allowing her to declare, \"I'm speaking,\" in one of the more viral instances of the night.\n\nIt's unclear whether she'll be able to replicate such a moment.\n\nThe candidates' microphones will be muted while their opponent is answering a question, something Harris' team argued against in the hopes of tempting Trump to aggressively interrupt her and come off as unpresidential.\n\nIn an election in which policy is largely taking a backseat to personality, producing such a clash might possibly spark one of the debate's most notable moments.\n\nHarris has been walking a tightrope since the start of her campaign between recognizing her role in Biden's administration and touting its achievements while also casting herself as a candidate in her own right, particularly after the unusual way in which she became her party's nominee.\n\nA recent New York Times/Siena College poll showed that roughly 61% of likely voters said the next president should represent a major change from Biden. Only 25% of them said Harris represented that change, compared to 53% who said Trump did.\n\nHarris so far has appeared mostly on the campaign trail by herself, and in a joint appearance in Pittsburgh and at Democrats' convention last month, Biden spoke first before handing the stage off to Harris, underscoring her role in the electoral spotlight.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has at times focused extensively on Biden, particularly in the days and weeks after the president ended his campaign and handed the reins to Harris.\n\nSuch a strategy risks focusing too much on Biden rather than Trump's own opponent -- but, allies said, tying Harris to voter disapproval of the way the current president has handled the economy and inflation could be a boon.\n\n\"For him to be viewed as having a successful debate, he has to continue that assault,\" said one former campaign aide in touch with Trump's current team. \"She's the vice president United States seeking the second term of Joe Biden. We can make that case.\"\n\nThe last debate between Biden and Trump was clearly consequential -- it ended the former's campaign. That doesn't mean Tuesday's debate will pack the same punch.\n\nSurely, millions will tune in to the latest salvo in a race packed with unpredictable twists and turns, raising the stakes. But many debates make little more than ripples in presidential races -- an outcome that might benefit neither candidate.\n\nAs it stands, it's a neck-and-neck race. Harris would like a moment that revives her momentum, which jolted her into contention but now is stalled; Trump would like a moment to erase some of the gains Harris has made and actually reverse her improved poll numbers.",

                "body": "PHILADELPHIA (TND) -- Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will take the stage Tuesday night for their first and potentially only debate against each other in an election running on razor-thin margins with less than two months left before Election Day.\n\nThe stakes are high for Trump and Harris as voters in some states will be able to start casting early ballots in a handful of states and Election Day is only 56 days away. Both are hoping to make gains with as many voters as possible in a race that is shaping up to be decided by just tens of thousands of votes spread across a handful of swing states.\n\nIt will be Trump's second debate of this cycle, having debated President Joe Biden in June in an event that ended up costing him his reelection campaign after a poor performance rattled Democratic confidence in the president's ability to win. But his opponent this time around will be much different than Biden, who at times struggled to string together sentences and forcefully rebut Trump's talking points.\n\nHarris has been preparing for the debate for more than a week and is expected to mount a much fiercer defense against Trump's attacks over the economy, immigration and other issues he is seeking to capitalize on.\n\n\"Now that her honeymoon is over, the debate will be the first time Kamala will answer tough questions. In doing so, Kamala Harris will be revealed to America as a Radical Left lunatic,\" Trump campaign advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles wrote in a memo on Monday.\n\nHarris' campaign has said she is the underdog in the race, though most polling indicates it is essentially tied and falls into the margin of error on each sample. They have also tried to build up Trump's reputation as an experienced debater, noting that he has participated in more presidential debates than any other candidate in history as he has been the Republican nominee for three consecutive cycles.\n\nThe debate starts at 9 p.m. ET. It can be viewed on ABC on TV or streaming online.",

                "title": "Kamala Harris vs Donald Trump: Presidential debate showdown set for tonight",
                "body": "Washington DC [US], September 10 (ANI): Ahead of the US presidential elections this November, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are set to face off in their first debate in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday.\n\nThe debate will mark the first time that the Democratic and Republican candidate will meet in person and share a stage. The two will spar for 90 minutes in a setting, which will have no studio audience nor will the two be allowed to have pre-written notes or props. The two candidates will also not be permitted to question each other directly.\n\nABC News outlet, which is moderating the debate, said the showdown is taking place months after the last debate ended President Joe Biden's re-election bid and catapulted Harris as the Democratic candidate.\n\nAs the countdown to Election Day reaches its final stretch, the stakes have never been higher. Tonight's highly anticipated debate will see the candidates grilled on the issues that matter most to voters, including the economy, immigration, and reproductive rights, as each tries to persuade millions of voters and viewers that they're the ones best suited to be president.\n\n\"I think there's an outsized expectation of 'gosh, the last guy dropped out, let's watch it.' So, I think that there's a lot more at stake than normally I would ever say is at stake,\" said Sean Spicer, Trump's first White House press secretary, as cited by ABC.\n\nTonight's highly anticipated debate promises to be a pivotal moment for Kamala Harris, as she faces intense scrutiny over the Biden administration's handling of contentious issues like border security and inflation. Moderators will likely push her to reconcile her current positions with the more liberal stances she took during her 2020 presidential campaign, including her recent shifts on fracking, border policy, and healthcare.\n\nDonald Trump, renowned for his capacity to dominate the political conversation and exploit his opponents' vulnerabilities, will likely seek to capitalize on his strengths on immigration and trade.\n\nAs Trump engages with Harris, he must tread carefully to avoid alienating female voters, among whom his support is already tenuous. If he comes across as condescending or dismissive, it could further erode his standing with this critical demographic. Harris, as the first woman of color to run for vice president on a major party ticket, presents a historic opportunity for the Democratic Party to connect with diverse voters and challenge Trump's divisive rhetoric.\n\nDemocrats who spoke to ABC News said that Harris has two main goals \"affirm to voters that she is ready to lead the country and the free world and to describe in more detail what policies she'd pursue as president.\"\n\nSimilarly, Republicans who spoke to ABC News said Trump should focus on policy contrasts, boasting that he has the edge on issues like inflation and immigration and can try to pin her down on her policy reversals on things like fracking - while he himself searches for consistent stances on issues like abortion.\n\nABC News said that Trump blamed the Biden-Harris administration's handling of the economy, saying their policies are to blame for inflation, which reached a 40-year high in 2022 but has since cooled to 2.9 per cent year-over-year as of July.\n\nTrump has pledged to cut costs by restoring \"energy independence\" through drilling more oil and lowering gas prices. He's also said he would reduce the national debt, eliminate regulations and implement a variety of tax cuts for domestic corporations as well as tariffs on foreign imports.\n\nHarris has presented an \"opportunity economy\" plan, which includes USD 25,000 in down-payment support for first-time homeowners, construction of 3 million new housing units, raising the minimum wage and a federal ban on corporate price-gouging on food and groceries.\n\nShe has also pitched a USD 50,000 tax benefit for new small businesses and a lower long-term capital gains tax of 28 per cent.\n\n\"World News Tonight\" anchor and managing editor David Muir and ABC News Live \"Prime\" anchor Linsey Davis will serve as moderators.\n\nIt's a big test for the Disney-owned network in the only scheduled debate between Harris and Trump in the 2024 race that could serve as a make-or-break moment for either campaign.\n\nSo while this debate could help set the political environment for the last two months of the 2024 presidential race, it also will be the last chance for the two candidates to reach some voters in states where every ballot matters.

Vance and Republican lawmakers, officials and influencers have pushed unfounded rumors out of Springfield, Ohio that have thrust the city's growing Haitian population into the center of the US presidential race.\n\n\"Protect our ducks and kittens in Ohio!\" Republicans on the US House Judiciary Committee posted on their X account, with an obviously fake image of Trump rescuing a white duck and a striped cat.\n\n\"Please vote for Trump so Haitian immigrants don't eat us,\" Senator Ted Cruz posted over an image of kittens.\n\nRepublicans appeared to be using the stories, which have clear racial undertones, to fuel a political attack against Trump's rival Kamala Harris to suggest she has failed to rein in illegal immigration during her three-plus years as US vice president.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nImmigration is seen as a critical issue in a nail-biter of an election, and the two candidates square off Tuesday night in their first and potentially only presidential debate.\n\nSome right-wing social media accounts had amplified a news report about a woman in Ohio allegedly eating and killing a pet cat. And while no evidence emerged linking the woman to migrants or the Haitian community, footage of her arrest was widely shared by influencers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCity law enforcement quickly debunked the conspiracy theories. \"There have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community,\" Springfield police said in a statement, adding there have been no verified instances of immigrants engaged in illegal activities like squatting in front of residents' homes.\n\nBut the disinformation posts have snowballed, having been viewed millions of times. X owner Elon Musk, who recently endorsed Trump and has 197 million followers on the platform formerly known as Twitter, has reposted some of the images.\n\nVance, who is from Ohio, took to X to claim that \"Haitian illegal immigrants (are) draining social services and generally causing chaos all over Springfield, Ohio.\n\n\"Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn't be in this country.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump himself weighed in Monday, posting on Truth Social: \"20,000 Haitian migrants were dumped into the small town of Springfield, Ohio,\" referring to the large influx of migrants from the impoverished Caribbean nation in recent years.\n\nSocial services, schools and housing have been stressed in the city for years, with some pointing to migration as a factor. The issues have been brought up at city functions, including an August 27 Springfield City Commission.\n\nLeading Democrats largely have not addressed the pet theft claims.",
