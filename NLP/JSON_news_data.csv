2024-08-06,0.098,"Kellyanne Conway, former advisor to President Donald Trump, has registered as a lobbyist for Ukrainian billionaire Victor Pinchuk. This information comes from a recent foreign agent disclosure filing.

What Happened: Conway registered last Friday to represent Pinchuk's foundation. The filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act reveals that Conway will liaise with U.S. lawmakers and experts on Ukraine's interests and raise awareness about ""Ukrainians' fight for freedom and the Russian illegal war of aggression,"" reported The Hill.

Conway is also expected to encourage U.S. lawmakers to attend the Yalta European Strategy annual meeting in Kyiv on Sept. 13-14. She will represent the U.K. office of the Victor Pinchuk Foundation, a private, nonpartisan, philanthropic company focused on advancing various causes in Ukraine.

The filing also reveals that Pinchuk ""owns and controls"" the foundation, which is not owned or controlled by the Ukrainian government. However, the Ukrainian government is the ""principal beneficiary of the registrant's activities directed by the foreign principal.""

Conway's agreement with the foundation includes a monthly fee of $50,000, with the term of the agreement running from July 25 to Nov. 14.

This move comes amidst hesitation from many Republicans to approve more aid to Ukraine. Conway's former boss, Trump, has previously suggested that additional aid to Ukraine could come as a loan and claimed he could end the war in 24 hours if he were in the White House.

Why It Matters: Conway is known for coining the phrase ""Alternative Facts"" during a Meet The Press interview in January 2017 when she defended White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer's false narrative about Trump's inauguration attendance figures.

More recently in 2022, she criticized Pennsylvania Democratic Senate nominee John Fetterman (D-Pa.) for his support of cannabis legalization.

In August 2023, she speculated that President Joe Biden might not participate in any debates in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election. However, the president did end up debating Trump but his disappointing performance led to his ultimate exit from the race.

2024-08-06,0.2784,"WASHINGTON -- Congressional Republicans, led by Michigan U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg, have introduced bills to reverse ambitious new vehicle fuel economy regulations issued by the Biden administration.

The administration's Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, commonly known as CAFE, were finalized in June and would require automakers' new vehicle fleets to achieve an average fuel economy of 53.5 miles per gallon by 2032.

""The extreme (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) CAFE standards are the latest attempt by the Biden-Harris administration to strip away choice from American consumers and mandate EVs,"" the Tipton Republican said in a statement about his bill.

Though the in-the-weeds technicalities of regulatory affairs aren't usually popular household issues, rules affecting the future of the U.S. auto industry have become a mainstay of the 2024 presidential election.

Republicans -- headlined by presidential nominee Donald Trump -- have consistently railed against President Joe Biden's efforts to significantly curb tailpipe emissions and encourage a shift toward electric vehicles as ways to fight climate change and keep pace with China's emergence as the world's leading EV maker.

Biden and his allies, meanwhile, have cheered the CAFE standards and similar efforts as smart for consumers' wallets and prudent for the future of the auto industry.

""Not only will these new standards save Americans money at the pump every time they fill up, they will also decrease harmful pollution and make America less reliant on foreign oil,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in June. ""These standards will save car owners more than $600 in gasoline costs over the lifetime of their vehicle.""

Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is leading a companion push on the Senate side to cancel the CAFE standards. The bills in both chambers invoke the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to rescind regulations shortly after they're finalized.

The effort is unlikely to succeed in the current politically divided Congress.

However, Republicans might be able to revive the action early next year if they win control of both chambers and the White House in November. That is due to a so-called lookback provision in the CRA that allows Congress to revisit late-passing rules from a previous presidential administration.

The highly-anticipated trigger date for the lookback period will not be final until at least one chamber of Congress adjourns for the year.

All regulations finalized after that date -- on average July 18, per a report from the Administrative Conference of the United States -- would be open to renewed challenges if Republicans manage to sweep the general elections.

That would keep the June 7 fuel economy standards safe from a later CRA challenge, though some observers think the window will close earlier this year.

The CAFE rule is one of many actions from Biden meant to reduce the environmental impact of consumer vehicles, which make up about 16% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, per EPA data.

His administration has devoted considerable time and resources to the matter, employing incentives and punitive regulations that push the auto industry toward electrification.

Other efforts have included two other key rules aimed at reducing tailpipe emissions; a $7,500 tax credit on qualifying new EV purchases via the climate-minded Inflation Reduction Act; $7.5 billion for EV charger buildout via the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law; IRA-funded manufacturing subsidies to repurpose old industrial centers for EVs; and a set of new tariffs that aim to protect U.S. automakers from competition with China, which has emerged as the world leader in EVs.

Republicans have roundly opposed those efforts.

""The Biden-Harris administration has declared war against affordable gas-powered cars,"" Cruz said in a statement, alluding to Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. ""I'm leading the effort in the Senate to stop radical environmentalists from both abusing the rulemaking process and trying to force electric vehicles on consumers who do not want them.""

""Unlike the Biden-Harris administration, Republicans continue to fight for consumers and innovators to have the ability to shape the future of the auto industry,"" Walberg added, ""not just unelected bureaucrats issuing radical mandates from Washington."""

2024-08-06,-0.0039,"People celebrate the resignation of Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in Dhaka, Bangladesh, August 5, 2024. File Image/Reuters

Tuesday, August 6, is a day that is set to be underlined by various crucial events across the globe.

Turmoil in Bangladesh has led its PM Sheikh Hasina to flee with the army coming in to form an interim government. It remains to be seen what step will be taken to ensure stability and peace.

In the US, Democratic party presidential nominee and current US Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to campaign in battleground states with her running mate.

Over in Paris where the 2024 Olympics are in full swing, India's only athletics Olympic gold medalist Neeraj Chopra will enter the arena for his event - the Javelin throw.

India is hosting the first Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Business Summit in New Delhi from today. The event will conclude on August 8.

Hasina flees, Bangladesh burns

Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has stepped down amidst violent protests across the country. The announcement of an interim government taking charge was made by Bangladesh Army Chief General Waqar-uz-Zaman on Monday.

There are unconfirmed reports suggesting she may be heading to a city in India.

Recently, she faced accusations of suppressing the opposition and acting like a dictator. A movement had been ongoing in the country for over a month. In the last two days alone, hundreds of people have lost their lives in protests against the Hasina government.

The unrest initially began as a protest against job quotas but quickly escalated into widespread anger against the Hasina administration, involving people from all segments of society. It is believed that the united front presented by the opposition played a significant role in compelling Hasina to resign.

Harris and co to tour battleground states

US Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running for president as a Democrat, will start a four-day visit to key states with her running mate on August 6, as announced by her campaign on Thursday.

This has led to increased speculation about the potential candidate. The identity of Harris's running mate for the 2024 presidential election remains a well-kept secret and is expected to be revealed today. According to US media reports, top contenders include Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.

Harris, 59, is the only person who has submitted paperwork to be the Democratic Party's nominee for the November 5 presidential election after US President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the race and endorsed her as the candidate on July 20.

Neeraj Chopra enters

One of India's top medal contenders, Olympic gold medalist Neeraj Chopra, was yet to begin competing. Although the track and field events at the Paris Olympics are already in progress, Chopra's event, the men's javelin throw came a few days later.

The men's javelin qualifiers is set for Tuesday, when Chopra will make his first appearance in the French capital. If the defending champion advances to the final, he will compete again to retain his title on August 8.

Chopra won the gold medal in the men's javelin at the delayed Tokyo Olympics with a throw of 87.58 meters. After his victory at the Tokyo Games, he also secured the World Championship title.

BIMSTEC in India - A first

India will host the inaugural Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Business Summit in New Delhi from August 6-8. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), in collaboration with the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII), is organising the event.

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will inaugurate the Business Summit, with Union Minister of Commerce and Industries Piyush Goyal and other leaders set to deliver keynote speeches."
2024-08-06,-0.1922,"Google illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge has ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Dow drops 1,000 points, and Japanese stocks suffer worst crash since 1987 as markets quake worldwide

NEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsened and set off another sell-off for financial markets around the world. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed a 12.4% plunge for Japan's Nikkei 225, its worst since 1987. Treasury yields pared their losses after a report showed U.S. services businesses are continuing to grow. But worries are still high after Friday's report showing U.S. employers pulled back on hiring last month by more than expected.

Tropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia and the Carolinas

HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with torrential rain, high winds and flooding, contributing to at least five deaths as it turned menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatened to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities. Record-setting rain was expected to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Historic cities including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, are gearing up for potential high water. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 50 mph.

Ex-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped

PHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.

Venezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo ""falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council"" and they openly incited ""police and military officials to disobey the laws.""

Rally dates are set. Venues are chosen. The only thing missing for Harris' blitz is her VP choice

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.

Kamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.

In Israel and Lebanon, life goes on even as the region teeters on the edge of all-out war

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- In Beirut, shops are open and traffic is as snarled as ever. In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Everyone expects that an all-out war would be far more devastating than any previous conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.

Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.

What's the deal with the Olympics? Your burning questions, answered

PARIS (AP) -- The Olympics have their own language, traditions and rules. And they are ever-evolving. It can be a lot to take in. The Associated Press is answering some of the most asked questions about the Paris Games. What's in the box that athletes get with their medals? An official poster, meaning they can skip the gift shop. And if you wanted to know why the PARIS Olympics are in so many different cities, it's a combination of factors including space and appropriate facilities. It's also not uncommon among Olympics."

However, Republicans might be able to revive the action early next year if they win control of both chambers and the White House in November. That is due to a so-called lookback provision in the CRA that allows Congress to revisit late-passing rules from a previous presidential administration.

The highly-anticipated trigger date for the lookback period will not be final until at least one chamber of Congress adjourns for the year.

All regulations finalized after that date -- on average July 18, per a report from the Administrative Conference of the United States -- would be open to renewed challenges if Republicans manage to sweep the general elections.

That would keep the June 7 fuel economy standards safe from a later CRA challenge, though some observers think the window will close earlier this year.

The CAFE rule is one of many actions from Biden meant to reduce the environmental impact of consumer vehicles, which make up about 16% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, per EPA data.

His administration has devoted considerable time and resources to the matter, employing incentives and punitive regulations that push the auto industry toward electrification.

Other efforts have included two otherkey rules aimed at reducing tailpipe emissions; a $7,500 tax credit on qualifying new EV purchases via the climate-minded Inflation Reduction Act; $7.5 billion for EV charger buildout via the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law; IRA-funded manufacturing subsidies to repurpose old industrial centers for EVs; and a set of new tariffs that aim to protect U.S. automakers from competition with China, which has emerged as the world leader in EVs.

Republicans have roundly opposed those efforts.

""The Biden-Harris administration has declared war against affordable gas-powered cars,"" Cruz said in a statement, alluding to Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. ""I'm leading the effort in the Senate to stop radical environmentalists from both abusing the rulemaking process and trying to force electric vehicles on consumers who do not want them.""

""Unlike the Biden-Harris administration, Republicans continue to fight for consumers and innovators to have the ability to shape the future of the auto industry,"" Walberg added, ""not just unelected bureaucrats issuing radical mandates from Washington.""

2024-08-06,-0.1922,"Google illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge has ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Dow drops 1,000 points, and Japanese stocks suffer worst crash since 1987 as markets quake worldwide

NEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsened and set off another sell-off for financial markets around the world. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed a 12.4% plunge for Japan's Nikkei 225, its worst since 1987. Treasury yields pared their losses after a report showed U.S. services businesses are continuing to grow. But worries are still high after Friday's report showing U.S. employers pulled back on hiring last month by more than expected.

Tropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia and the Carolinas

HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with torrential rain, high winds and flooding, contributing to at least five deaths as it turned menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatened to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities. Record-setting rain was expected to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Historic cities including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, are gearing up for potential high water. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 50 mph.

Ex-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped

PHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.

Venezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo ""falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council"" and they openly incited ""police and military officials to disobey the laws.""

Rally dates are set. Venues are chosen. The only thing missing for Harris' blitz is her VP choice

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.

Kamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.

In Israel and Lebanon, life goes on even as the region teeters on the edge of all-out war

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- In Beirut, shops are open and traffic is as snarled as ever. In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Everyone expects that an all-out war would be far more devastating than any previous conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.

Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.

What's the deal with the Olympics? Your burning questions, answered

PARIS (AP) -- The Olympics have their own language, traditions and rules. And they are ever-evolving. It can be a lot to take in. The Associated Press is answering some of the most asked questions about the Paris Games. What's in the box that athletes get with their medals? An official poster, meaning they can skip the gift shop. And if you wanted to know why the PARIS Olympics are in so many different cities, it's a combination of factors including space and appropriate facilities. It's also not uncommon among Olympics."
2024-08-06,0.051,"WASHINGTON - Congressional Republicans, led by Michigan U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg, have introduced bills to reverse ambitious new vehicle fuel economy regulations issued by the Biden administration.

The administration's Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, commonly known as CAFE, were finalized in June and would require automakers' new vehicle fleets to achieve an average fuel economy of 53.5 miles per gallon by 2032.

""The extreme (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) CAFE standards are the latest attempt by the Biden-Harris administration to strip away choice from American consumers and mandate EVs,"" the Tipton Republican said in a statement about his bill.

Though the in-the-weeds technicalities of regulatory affairs aren't usually popular household issues, rules affecting the future of the U.S. auto industry have become a mainstay of the 2024 presidential election.

Republicans - headlined by presidential nominee Donald Trump - have consistently railed against President Joe Biden's efforts to significantly curb tailpipe emissions and encourage a shift toward electric vehicles as ways to fight climate change and keep pace with China's emergence as the world's leading EV maker.

Biden and his allies, meanwhile, have cheered the CAFE standards and similar efforts as smart for consumers' wallets and prudent for the future of the auto industry.

""Not only will these new standards save Americans money at the pump every time they fill up, they will also decrease harmful pollution and make America less reliant on foreign oil,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in June. ""These standards will save car owners more than $600 in gasoline costs over the lifetime of their vehicle.""

Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is leading a companion push on the Senate side to cancel the CAFE standards. The bills in both chambers invoke the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to rescind regulations shortly after they're finalized.

The highly-anticipated trigger date for the lookback period will not be final until at least one chamber of Congress adjourns for the year.

All regulations finalized after that date - on average July 18, per a report from the Administrative Conference of the United States - would be open to renewed challenges if Republicans manage to sweep the general elections.

That would keep the June 7 fuel economy standards safe from a later CRA challenge, though some observers think the window will close earlier this year.

The CAFE rule is one of many actions from Biden meant to reduce the environmental impact of consumer vehicles, which make up about 16% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, per EPA data.

His administration has devoted considerable time and resources to the matter, employing incentives and punitive regulations that push the auto industry toward electrification.

Other efforts have included two otherkey rules aimed at reducing tailpipe emissions; a $7,500 tax credit on qualifying new EV purchases via the climate-minded Inflation Reduction Act; $7.5 billion for EV charger buildout via the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law; IRA-funded manufacturing subsidies to repurpose old industrial centers for EVs; and a set of new tariffs that aim to protect U.S. automakers from competition with China, which has emerged as the world leader in EVs.

Republicans have roundly opposed those efforts.

""The Biden-Harris administration has declared war against affordable gas-powered cars,"" Cruz said in a statement, alluding to Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. ""I'm leading the effort in the Senate to stop radical environmentalists from both abusing the rulemaking process and trying to force electric vehicles on consumers who do not want them.""

""Unlike the Biden-Harris administration, Republicans continue to fight for consumers and innovators to have the ability to shape the future of the auto industry,"" Walberg added, ""not just unelected bureaucrats issuing radical mandates from Washington."""
2024-08-06,-0.3569,"Dow drops 1,000 points, and Japanese stocks suffer worst crash since 1987 as markets quake worldwide

NEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsened and set off another sell-off for financial markets around the world. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed a 12.4% plunge for Japan's Nikkei 225, its worst since 1987. Treasury yields pared their losses after a report showed U.S. services businesses are continuing to grow. But worries are still high after Friday's report showing U.S. employers pulled back on hiring last month by more than expected.

Tropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia and the Carolinas

HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with torrential rain, high winds and flooding, contributing to at least five deaths as it turned menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatened to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities. Record-setting rain was expected to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Historic cities including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, are gearing up for potential high water. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 50 mph.

Google illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge has ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Ex-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped

PHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.

Venezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo ""falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council"" and they openly incited ""police and military officials to disobey the laws.""

Rally dates are set. Venues are chosen. The only thing missing for Harris' blitz is her VP choice

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.

Kamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.

In Israel and Lebanon, life goes on even as the region teeters on the edge of all-out war

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- In Beirut, shops are open and traffic is as snarled as ever. In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Everyone expects that an all-out war would be far more devastating than any previous conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.

Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.

2024-08-05,-0.3412,"The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a lawsuit filed by Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey seeking to lift a gag order and delay Donald Trump's sentencing on multiple convictions in his New York City hush money trial. Bailey said in a statement that New York's ""illicit prosecution"" has undermined the Republican candidate's ability to run for president.

Bailey filed the suit in July, arguing that the state of New York violated ""Missourians' First Amendment right to hear from a presidential candidate in the 2024 presidential election.""

The lawsuit adds that the state's ""overt meddling in a presidential election sabotages Missourians' ability to hear from and cast a fully-informed vote for president mere months before the election.""

New York argued the lawsuit was flawed and that Missouri did not suffer sufficient injury that would give it standing to sue. New York's solicitor general wrote in a brief that allowing the suit to go forward would ""permit an extraordinary and dangerous end-run around former President Trump's ongoing state court proceedings and the statutory limitations on this Court's jurisdiction to review state court decisions.""

The Supreme Court denied the request without outlining its reasoning, writing, ""Missouri's motion for leave to file a bill of complaint is denied, and its motion for preliminary relief or a stay is dismissed as moot.""

Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito said they would ""grant the motion for leave to file the bill of complaint but would not grant other relief.

A Manhattan jury convicted Trump in May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with money sent to porn actor Stormy Daniels. Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen sent Daniels $130,000 to stay quiet about an alleged affair she had with the former president.

Trump denies any affair and has said he will appeal the convictions. His sentencing is set for September 18."
2024-08-05,-0.2235,"Anxiety over a potential slowdown in the U.S. economy intensified on Monday as Wall Street and international exchanges saw sharp declines, sparking reactions from the 2024 presidential election candidates.

Global shares began collapsing at the end of last week when investors grew alarmed at the prospect of a U.S. recession. A U.S. Labor Department report released on Friday showed American employers added 114,000 jobs, a significant drop from the 179,000 in June.

On Monday, the global market plunge struck the U.S., as American stocks fell sharply after opening as the Dow Jones index plummeted more than 1,030 points, or 2.6 percent. Warnings have emerged that tech giants like Apple and Nvidia might be overvalued. On Friday, the Nasdaq composite entered a correction phase, marking a 10 percent decline from its recent high and continued to drop by an additional 3.4 percent on Monday.

This arrives among concerns that the Federal Reserve may have held its key interest rate too high for too long, heightening the risk of a U.S. recession, reported the Associated Press (AP).

Economists and Wall Street traders are now predicting that the Fed will cut its benchmark rate, which influences borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, much sooner than expected. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly emphasized that the central bank can quickly lower rates if necessary to support the economy, according to the AP.

Despite recurring fears of an impending recession, these predictions have consistently proven wrong in the post-pandemic economy. Steady economic growth and robust hiring have endured against most analysts' expectations, the news outlet added.

This comes as the 2024 presidential election is fast approaching, as Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are expected to face off in November.

In wake of the market news, Trump blamed Harris, taking aim at her in a video posted to his Truth Social account, sharing a video and captioning it ""Kamala Krash.""

Trump previously took credit for record highs under President Joe Biden's leadership.

Newsweek reached out to the campaigns of Trump and Harris via email for comment on Monday.

A Harris campaign account, Kamala HQ, posted to X, formerly Twitter, a clip of Trump from a rally in which he says: ""If Biden wins, you're gonna have a stock market collapse the likes of which you've never had.""

It is followed by a separate image of a post made by Trump on Truth Social that says: ""THIS IS THE TRUMP STOCK MARKET.""

The Biden campaign post reads: ""Right: Trump in 2020 claiming the stock market will collapse if President Biden wins. Left: Trump [in January] desperately trying to take credit for the stock market hitting record highs under President Biden.""

Experts have reacted by advising investors to maintain a long-term perspective, particularly for retirement funds, adding that panic selling during market downturns typically results in greater losses, according to AP.

Jacob Channel, senior economist for LendingTree, noted that markets have historically recovered from worse sell-offs, the news outlet added."

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.

NEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsened and set off another sell-off for financial markets around the world. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%.

But worries are still high after Friday's report showing U.S. employers pulled back on hiring last month by more than expected.

Tropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia and the Carolinas

HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with torrential rain and high winds, contributing to at least four deaths as it turned menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatened to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities. Record-setting rain was expected to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Historic cities including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, are gearing up for potential high water. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 50 mph.

Google illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. After reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Ex-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped

PHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.

Venezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo ""falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council"" and they openly incited ""police and military officials to disobey the laws.""

Rally dates are set. Venues are chosen. The only thing missing for Harris' blitz is her VP choice

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.

Kamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.

In Israel and Lebanon, life goes on even as the region teeters on the edge of all-out war

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- In Beirut, shops are open and traffic is as snarled as ever. In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Everyone expects that an all-out war would be far more devastating than any previous conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.

2024-08-05,-0.2235,"Anxiety over a potential slowdown in the U.S. economy intensified on Monday as Wall Street and international exchanges saw sharp declines, sparking reactions from the 2024 presidential election candidates.

Global shares began collapsing at the end of last week when investors grew alarmed at the prospect of a U.S. recession. A U.S. Labor Department report released on Friday showed American employers added 114,000 jobs, a significant drop from the 179,000 in June.

On Monday, the global market plunge struck the U.S., as American stocks fell sharply after opening as the Dow Jones index plummeted more than 1,030 points, or 2.6 percent. Warnings have emerged that tech giants like Apple and Nvidia might be overvalued. On Friday, the Nasdaq composite entered a correction phase, marking a 10 percent decline from its recent high and continued to drop by an additional 3.4 percent on Monday.

This arrives among concerns that the Federal Reserve may have held its key interest rate too high for too long, heightening the risk of a U.S. recession, reported the Associated Press (AP).

Economists and Wall Street traders are now predicting that the Fed will cut its benchmark rate, which influences borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, much sooner than expected. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly emphasized that the central bank can quickly lower rates if necessary to support the economy, according to the AP.

Despite recurring fears of an impending recession, these predictions have consistently proven wrong in the post-pandemic economy. Steady economic growth and robust hiring have endured against most analysts' expectations, the news outlet added.

This comes as the 2024 presidential election is fast approaching, as Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are expected to face off in November.

In wake of the market news, Trump blamed Harris, taking aim at her in a video posted to his Truth Social account, sharing a video and captioning it ""Kamala Krash.""

Trump previously took credit for record highs under President Joe Biden's leadership.

Newsweek reached out to the campaigns of Trump and Harris via email for comment on Monday.

A Harris campaign account, Kamala HQ, posted to X, formerly Twitter, a clip of Trump from a rally in which he says: ""If Biden wins, you're gonna have a stock market collapse the likes of which you've never had.""

It is followed by a separate image of a post made by Trump on Truth Social that says: ""THIS IS THE TRUMP STOCK MARKET.""

The Biden campaign post reads: ""Right: Trump in 2020 claiming the stock market will collapse if President Biden wins. Left: Trump [in January] desperately trying to take credit for the stock market hitting record highs under President Biden.""

Experts have reacted by advising investors to maintain a long-term perspective, particularly for retirement funds, adding that panic selling during market downturns typically results in greater losses, according to AP.

Jacob Channel, senior economist for LendingTree, noted that markets have historically recovered from worse sell-offs, the news outlet added."

Reformed Gangster Disciples Boss, Harold 'Noonie G' Ward Hosts Citywide Voter Registration Drive During the DNC in Support of VP Kamala Harris

Attorney Jenna Sutter Joins All Injuries Law Firm"
2024-08-05,0.0667,"DALLAS - Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to announce her running mate for the 2024 presidential election by Tuesday night.

Tuesday, she'll also begin visiting seven traditional battleground states over five days.

Meanwhile, Dallas attorney Jill Louis, who was a sorority sister of Harris, is helping with the vice president's campaign in North Texas.

Back in 1986, Louis, Harris and 36 others at Howard University became members of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, an organization of which its founding principles are community service.

""The sorority is a training for young women,"" Louis said.

With three months until Election Day, Louis says the novelty of their connection to Harris is secondary to the actual work.

""It's also work. She needs a lot of people around her. She needs all the support she can get. Any candidate does,"" Louis said. ""One of the important things that we do and really think about is how do we educate people around the choices they have thus far and getting out and making sure they are registered to exercise their constitutional right to vote.""

Louis explains their mission involves the work of individual sorority members. They are not acting on behalf of the sorority itself.

She points to that same perspective when it comes to the influence of the Divine Nine, or the network of 9 historically Black sororities and fraternities.

""This is a continuation of that training ground, so we act in the same way. We've always been about civics and rights of people and uplift,"" Louis said.

Louis and a number of line sisters got to visit with Harris in July after she spoke at the sorority's national conference in Dallas.

""A bunch of our line sisters were all together,"" she said. ""I think ultimately 14 of us were in town at the boule of our 38-member line.""

Louis also mentions another sorority training ground trait is confidence.

""What we demonstrated in the last few weeks is that we can be formidable in fundraising, and that's something we've been doing since the beginning as our group of line sisters, supporting each other across the country whenever someone is running for something,"" she said.

This time, it just happens to be the highest office in the country.

""I'm very excited, very excited,"" Louis said. ""There's a lot of work to be done."""
2024-08-05,0.1216,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is one of Vice President Kamala Harris' top picks for a presidential running mate, and a decision is expected by Tuesday.

Harris has narrowed down her list to two or three candidates, according to national media reports, with the vice president meeting with finalists over the weekend. Walz, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, of Arizona, met with Harris on Sunday, the Washington Post and others reported.

Walz would bring his liberal record as governor, experience in Congress as well as small-town Midwestern credentials and his background as a school teacher and his military service to the ticket.

And in recent weeks he's gained national media attention for going on the attack against Republicans by calling them ""weird,"" a tactic that's gained traction among Democrats trying to convince swing voters to come to their side.

The odds look decent that Minnesota's governor will join the Democratic presidential ticket.

So if he does, what happens next?

Should Walz run with Harris, he will continue serving as governor through the presidential election. But if Harris defeats former President Donald Trump in November, Walz will have to step down.

If that happens, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan would become governor of Minnesota for the rest of Walz's second four-year term, which ends in January 2027. She would be the first woman and first Native American to hold the state's highest elected office.

Even if Walz doesn't get picked as vice president, he's widely seen as a favorite for a cabinet position in a future Democratic administration. If Harris wins the 2024 presidential election, Walz could end up leaving the governor's office if he's asked to lead an executive agency like the Department of Education or Veterans Affairs.

The last Minnesota to serve as vice president was Walter Mondale in President Jimmy Carter's administration. Before that Hubert Humphrey served with President Lyndon B. Johnson.

With the lieutenant governor's office open, the Minnesota Constitution calls for the ""presiding officer"" of the Senate to fill the position.

If that were to happen right now, it would mean Senate President Bobby Joe Champion, a Minneapolis DFLer, would fill the role. He would become Minnesota's first Black lieutenant governor.

The Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party currently splits control of the Senate 33-33 with Republicans after the June resignation of State Sen. Kelly Morrison, DFL-Deephaven, who is running for Minnesota's 3rd Congressional District. However, the Legislature isn't scheduled to convene until January.

There's a special election for Morrison's Senate seat in November on the same day as the general election that will determine who controls the majority in the Minnesota Senate. The rest of the Minnesota Senate isn't up for election until 2026.

If Champion were to become lieutenant governor and step down from the senate, there would also be a special election for his seat. Democrats likely would regain control as his north Minneapolis district is a safe Democratic stronghold.

Though past transitions haven't gone quite as smoothly.

In January 2018, then-Gov. Mark Dayton appointed Lt. Gov. Tina Smith to fill former U.S. Sen. Al Franken's seat after Franken resigned amid a sexual harassment scandal.

The move automatically made Republican Senate President Michelle Fischbach the lieutenant governor.

Fischbach refused to resign from the Senate as it would have ended a slim Republican majority in the chamber. That prompted lawsuits from DFLers, who alleged holding two offices at once violated the state Constitution.

Fischbach refused to take the oath of her new office, and instead called herself ""acting lieutenant governor."" But she resigned from the Senate in May following the 2018 legislative session."
2024-08-05,-0.3412,"The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a lawsuit filed by Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey seeking to lift a gag order and delay Donald Trump's sentencing on multiple convictions in his New York City hush money trial. Bailey said in a statement that New York's ""illicit prosecution"" has undermined the Republican candidate's ability to run for president.

Bailey filed the suit in July, arguing that the state of New York violated ""Missourians' First Amendment right to hear from a presidential candidate in the 2024 presidential election.""

The lawsuit adds that the state's ""overt meddling in a presidential election sabotages Missourians' ability to hear from and cast a fully-informed vote for president mere months before the election.""

New York argued the lawsuit was flawed and that Missouri did not suffer sufficient injury that would give it standing to sue. New York's solicitor general wrote in a brief that allowing the suit to go forward would ""permit an extraordinary and dangerous end-run around former President Trump's ongoing state court proceedings and the statutory limitations on this Court's jurisdiction to review state court decisions.""

The Supreme Court denied the request without outlining its reasoning, writing, ""Missouri's motion for leave to file a bill of complaint is denied, and its motion for preliminary relief or a stay is dismissed as moot.""

Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito said they would ""grant the motion for leave to file the bill of complaint but would not grant other relief.

2024-08-05,0.1686,"In a recent interview, Pelosi praised the accomplishments of Biden and said he belongs on Mount Rushmore.

Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was one of the prominent members of Congress who may have influenced President Joe Biden to drop out of the 2024 presidential election.

Now, Pelosi is calling for Biden to be added to Mount Rushmore and honored as one of top presidents.

What Happened: Rep. Pelosi was reported to be one of the members of Congress who pushed for Biden to step down from the race in an effort to have a better shot at the Democratic Party defeating Donald Trump in the 2024 election.

Pelosi brushed off Biden being mad at her and the representative being the one behind his decision to step down during an appearance on ""CBS Sunday Morning Show.""

""I've never shared any conversation with a president of the United States publicly, no,"" Pelosi said when asked what she told the current president.

Pelosi was asked if Biden is furious at her.

""He knows that I love him very much.""

Pelosi said she was not the leader of a plan to push Biden out and said she did not call one person despite reports that say otherwise.

Listing Biden's accomplishments during his presidency, Pelosi recalled his leadership of the NATO Summit and the president being at the ""top of his game"" in recent months.

""He was in a good place to make whatever decision -- the top of his game. Such a consequential president of the United States, a Mount Rushmore kind of president of the United States.""

Mount Rushmore in South Dakota currently features George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and Thomas Jefferson, all considered to be among the best presidents in American history.

""Well, you got Teddy Roosevelt up there, and he's wonderful. I don't say take him down. But you can add Biden.""

While Pelosi has stated that she was not behind the plan to oust Biden, recent public comments could point to being influential in the decision. Pelosi said that Biden needed to make a decision about the 2024 election even after he stated he was still in. The representative also said it was up to Biden to decide if he was still going to run after the president said he was ""firmly committed"" to the 2024 election.

Along with being known for her recent reported ouster of Biden, Pelosi is widely followed for her Congress Trading activity, which has recently included her husband buying shares of semiconductor stock NVIDIA Corporation.

Congress Is Making Huge Investments. Get Tips On What They Bought And Sold Ahead Of The 2024 Election With Our Easy-to-Use Tool

Why It's Important: Pressure from Democratic members of Congress who publicly called for Biden to step down after his poor performance in the first presidential debate may have led to him withdrawing from the 2024 election.

Pelosi has publicly backed Vice President Kamala Harris for president since Biden dropped out.

The comments from Pelosi may spark controversy with many pointing to poor economic performance, immigration concerns and periods of high inflation during Biden's time in office.

Biden has clapped back at comments from Trump, who predicted the stock market would fall during Biden's time in the White House.

The S&P 500, which is tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY has set several records for all-time highs during Biden's time in office.

During his first year in office, the S&P 500 gained 37.4%, marking the best one-year return under a president in their first year since Harry Truman in 1945.

Periods of high inflation and the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic led to the S&P 500 declining 19% in 2022, the largest annual drop since 2008.

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust is up 35.8% since Biden's inauguration, going from $381.11 to $517.38. During Trump's four years in office, the S&P 500 was up 67%.

Speaking of Trump, Pelosi's comment that Biden should be added to Mount Rushmore might upset the former president. For years, Trump has made comments about wanting to be added to Mount Rushmore. Reports have also said that Trump contacted the South Dakota governor to see if he could be added to the monument.

No president has been added to this monument that attracts millions of visitors annually since the original four were constructed, likely forever leaving Biden and Trump both out.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. After reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Ex-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped

PHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people charged in the case have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Rudy Giuliani at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She had pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.

Venezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez and leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the country's armed forces to abandon their support of President Nicolás Maduro and stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to the written appeal that the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier over the demonstrators who came out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said that Gonzalez's and Machado's statement shows the alleged commission of various crimes including usurpation of functions, dissemination of false information to cause fear and conspiracy.

Rally dates are set. Venues are chosen. The only thing missing for Harris' blitz is her VP choice

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.

Kamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.

In Israel and Lebanon, life goes on even as the region teeters on the edge of all-out war

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- In Beirut, shops are open and traffic is as snarled as ever. In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Everyone expects that an all-out war would be far more devastating than any previous conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.

Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.

Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey (R) has waged several successful legal efforts against the Biden administration and continues to do battle against government overreach. However, his office's recent effort to intercede regarding the New York criminal case brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg against former President Donald Trump has met with rejection.

On July 3, Bailey's office filed a motion for leave to file a ""bill of complaint"" against the State of New York in the United States Supreme Court. In the motion, Missouri sought a temporary stay of the gag order and sentencing in Trump's case in the run-up to the election.

Missouri seeks modest relief: a stay of New York's gag order and impending sentence against Donald J. Trump during the 2024 Presidential election season so Missourians can participate in the election free from New York's exercise of coercive power limiting the ability of Trump to campaign.

As set forth in the accompanying brief and complaint, the actions by New York have created constitutional harms that threaten to infringe the rights of Missouri's voters and electors, namely:

Missouri respectfully submits that the forgoing violations establish considerable harms to voters and electors in Missouri, who will be precluded from fully engaging with and hearing from a major-party Presidential candidate in the run up to the November election. These harms are a direct consequence of New York's calculated, unprecedented decision to prosecute Trump for alleged bookkeeping offenses just months before the Presidential election.

Another Blow to Joe: Appeals Court Blocks Biden Student Loan Plan

On Monday, however, the Supreme Court issued an order denying Missouri's motion.

Missouri's motion for leave to file a bill of complaint is denied, and its motion for preliminary relief or a stay is dismissed as moot. Justice Thomas and Justice Alito would grant the motion for leave to file the bill of complaint but would not grant other relief.

The order is obviously brief, simply denying the relief requested by the State of Missouri, but does indicate that Justices Thomas and Alito would have granted the motion to file the bill of complaint.

As CNN notes, the effort was somewhat of a longshot.

Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey attempted to file the longshot suit against New York in early July, claiming in part that the gag order violated the First Amendment rights of voters in his state to hear Trump speak.

But the case was widely viewed as unlikely to gain traction at the Supreme Court in part because of the sweeping implications of allowing a state to intervene in a pending criminal case unfolding in a different state.

Following the ruling, Bailey issued a statement on Twitter/X, expressing his disappointment with the outcome but vowing to continue efforts to combat Joe Biden's (and Kamala Harris's) Department of Justice:"

2024-08-05,0.1529,"Kamala Harris, the party-installed alternative to Joe Biden in the 2024 presidential election, is now squarely in the national spotlight. She and her handlers like to pretend this gives her the opportunity to invent her political persona out of whole cloth so that she can appeal to that decisive section of the American electorate that can be swayed in one direction or another.

In fact, Harris has a long political record, one that is now coming back to haunter her as she tries to portray herself as competent, professional, and middle-of-the-road. And if there's one issue that has consistently defined her extreme brand of far-left politics, it is contempt for the Second Amendment. Try as she might, she cannot outrun that legacy.

We began delving into Harris's record on Second Amendment issues last week. This included - during her time as a state and local politician in California -- denying that the Second Amendment protects a right to keep and bear arms unrelated to militia service and insisting that it has no bearing on state or local gun control laws. These are not only extreme positions in 2024, after the Supreme Court has authoritatively ruled on these issues to the contrary, they were extreme positions then. A 2008 Gallup poll that showed only 20% of Americans agreed with Harris's interpretation of the Second Amendment as applying solely to state militias, while 73% did not. In San Francisco, where she was free to be as far-left as she wanted, Harris was perfectly willing to be out of step with mainstream American thought on the Second Amendment.

Later, as a candidate for the democratic presidential nomination in 2020, Harris even mocked Joe Biden's reluctance to use executive authority to ""eliminate"" so-called ""assault weapons."" This is the term anti-gun Democrats use for America's most popular rifles, including the AR-15. While clearly agreeable to that idea in principle, even Biden had to admit it was unconstitutional. Yet when asked for her opinion on the matter, Harris laughed in Biden's face, and quipped: ""I would just say, hey, Joe, instead of saying no we can't, let's say, yes we can.""

Saying ""yes we can"" to unconstitutional executive actions to ban and confiscate America's favorite guns now presents a problem for Harris. Her strategy to deal with that problem? Gaslight and deny it.

According to the New York Times, a reliable ally of the Democrat party, ""video clips of [Kamala Harris's] old statements and interviews are being weaponized as Republicans aim to define her as a left-wing radical who is out of step with swing voters.""

""Weaponization"" is strange way to describe letting a person's own words and professional actions define the person's values, beliefs, and policy positions.

Even stranger is how the Harris campaign plans to respond to those who bring up what the candidate herself has said and done during her political career, according to that same article: ""The Harris campaign will rebut most of Republicans' attacks by arguing that they are exaggerating or lying about her record, said a campaign official briefed on the plans who was not authorized to discuss them publicly.""

It would be one thing for Harris to claim she was wrong then and has since come to her senses and changed her mind. However unconvincing that might be, it would at least in theory be within the realm of possibility.

But Harris and her handlers want to rewrite history itself to deny the positions she took, the things she said, and their necessary implications.

So who are you going to believe? Kamala Harris then? Or Kamala Harris now? What you cannot believe, so we are told, is your own ears and eyes.

There is a term in American law called ""declaration against interest."" It is used when judging the reliability of a statement by a person who is not available in court to answer for his or her own words. This principle holds that when a person says something that is clearly contrary to his or her own best interests, it is more likely to be true. Put another way, when people are trying to protect themselves, they lie. But when they think they can talk with impunity, they tell the truth.

In the bubbles of California, San Francisco, and a Democrat primary, where far-left opinions are fashionable and rewarded, Harris could truly speak her mind on guns. Now that she is answerable for those opinions to a wider American audience, she is - right on cue - trying to retreat from them. And, right on cue, her media collaborators are doing their best to help her deny and rewrite the historical record.

America's gun owners, however, should neither forget nor forgive where Harris has stood on their constitutional right to keep and bear arms. We will have plenty more to say on that record - or, more precisely, we'll tell you what Harris herself has said -in the weeks to come."
2024-08-05,-0.1373,"A soldier carries chairs as election workers prepare polling stations in Caracas, Venezuela, Friday, July 26, 2024. The presidential election is set for July 28.

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor on Monday announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the country's armed forces to abandon its support of President Nicolás Maduro and stop repressing demonstrators.

Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to the written appeal that the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election.

The armed forces are traditionally the arbiter of political disputes in Venezuela. But they've shown no inkling of ditching Maduro even in the face of credible evidence presented by the opposition that it trounced the self-proclaimed socialist at the polls by a more than 2-to-1 margin.

González and Machado called on rank and file members of the security forces to rethink their loyalty to Maduro.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's opposition leaders are calling on the country's armed forces to abandon their support of President Nicolás Maduro and stop repressing demonstrators who have come out in force to dispute the leader's claim he prevailed in last Sunday's election.

The armed forces are traditionally the arbiter of political disputes in Venezuela and have been key to Maduro's grip on power ever since he took over the so-called Bolivarian revolution in 2013 from his mentor, the late Hugo Chávez.

So far, they've shown no signs of ditching Maduro even in the face of credible evidence presented by the opposition that it trounced the self-proclaimed socialist at the polls by a more than 2-to-1 margin.

In a message posted Monday on social media, Edmundo González -- who the U.S. and a half dozen countries have recognized as the victor -- and opposition leader Maria Corina Machado called on rank and file members of the security forces to rethink their loyalty.

""We appeal to the conscience of the military and police to put themselves on the side of the people and their families,"" the two wrote in a long message.

""We won this election without any doubt. It was an electoral avalanche,"" the two continued. ""Now it's up to all of us to respect the voice of the people.""

Authorities have declared Maduro the victor in last Sunday's election but have yet to produce voting tallies to prove he won. The opposition claims to have collected records from more than 80% of the 30,000 polling booths nationwide showing it won.

Maduro announced Saturday that the government has arrested 2,000 opponents and at a rally in Caracas he pledged to detain more people and send them to prison. The post-electoral uprising has also claimed at least 11 deaths, according to Foro Penal, a Caracas-based human rights group.

The Venezuela-based human rights organization Provea, in a report issued Monday analyzing the post-election climate, concluded that the government's response to silence people's discontent has been ""through the disproportionate use of force"" that has resulted in the deaths of protesters, ""the open coordinated action between security forces and groups of armed civilians in favor of Nicolás Maduro to calm the protests, and the exponential increase in arbitrary arrests.""

The organization reported that based on figures announced by the Attorney General's Office last week, the number of arrests against real or perceived government opponents is equivalent to about 42% ""of the total number of arbitrary arrests recorded by Provea between April and August 2017, the most important cycle of protests in the country since 1989.""

González and Machado in their missive called on Venezuelans with family members serving in the security forces to urge their loved ones not to attack protesters and obey illegal orders. It said it would offer ""guarantees"" to soldiers who follow the constitution even while promising there would be no impunity for those behind abuses and following illegal orders.

Both González, a former diplomat, and Machado -- who was barred by the government from running -- have gone into hiding, saying they fear they will be arrested or killed. Maduro and his cadres have threatened to lock them both up.

As Venezuelans fight Maduro on the streets, pressure is also building internationally for the Venezuelan government to publish the full breakdown of the electoral results.

But so far, Maduro has instead asked the country's supreme court -- which like all institutions in Venezuela is packed with loyalists -- to review any claims of irregularities.

""Respect for popular sovereignty is what moves us to defend the transparency of the (election) results,"" Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said Monday in a press conference alongside fellow leftist President Gabriel Boric of Chile.

Boric, who cast doubt on Maduro's victory claim in an unexpectedly strong statement within hours of Venezuela's July 28 election, told reporters that he and Lula discussed the situation in Venezuela on Monday, without elaborating. The leaders did not take questions and their carefully worded statements signaled how leftist leaders in the region are gingerly trying to show respect for Venezuela's sovereignty while voicing doubts about the official results.

A few of Maduro's staunch allies -- including Russia, China and Cuba -- have applauded his victory. On Monday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian held a telephone call with Maduro and reiterated his congratulations and ""condemned any foreign interference in Venezuela's internal affairs,"" Pezeshkian's office said.

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with torrential rain and high winds, contributing to at least four deaths as it turned menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatened to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities. Record-setting rain was expected to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Historic cities including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, are gearing up for potential high water. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 50 mph.

Google illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. After reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Ex-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped

PHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people charged in the case have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Rudy Giuliani at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She had pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.

Venezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez and leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the country's armed forces to abandon their support of President Nicolás Maduro and stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to the written appeal that the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier over the demonstrators who came out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said that Gonzalez's and Machado's statement shows the alleged commission of various crimes including usurpation of functions, dissemination of false information to cause fear and conspiracy.

Rally dates are set. Venues are chosen. The only thing missing for Harris' blitz is her VP choice

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.

Kamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.

In Israel and Lebanon, life goes on even as the region teeters on the edge of all-out war

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- In Beirut, shops are open and traffic is as snarled as ever. In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Everyone expects that an all-out war would be far more devastating than any previous conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.

Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.

Former President Trump told FOX Business' Maria Bartiromo last week that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg called him to apologize after Facebook wrongly mislabeled a now-viral photo of the former president.

The photo showing Trump raising a fist after a July 13 assassination attempt at his campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, sliced his ear was initially labeled as misinformation on the social media site.

""So, Mark Zuckerberg called me. First of all, he called me two times. He called me after the event and he said that was really amazing,"" Trump told Bartiromo in a ""Mornings with Maria"" interview that aired Thursday. ""It was really brave. And he actually announced that he's not going to support a Democrat because he can't because he respected me for what I did that day. I think what I did... to me, was a normal response.""

""He actually apologized. He said they made a mistake... and they're correcting the mistake,"" Trump said, adding that Google never called him after the search engine's autocomplete function failed to show results for the Trump assassination attempt.

ZUCKERBERG SAYS TRUMP FIST PUMP REACTION TO SHOOTING WAS 'BADA-'

Meta Vice President of Global Policy Joel Kaplan said in a July 30 statement that Meta incorrectly added a fact-check label to the assassination attempt photo, which quickly went viral and appeared in global news outlets, because the social media giant's AI detector tool ""experienced an issue related to the circulation of a doctored photo of former President Trump with his fist in the air, which made it look like the Secret Service agents were smiling.""

""Because the photo was altered, a fact check label was initially and correctly applied,"" Kaplan explained. ""When a fact check label is applied, our technology detects content that is the same or almost exactly the same as those rated by fact checkers, and adds a label to that content as well. Given the similarities between the doctored photo and the original image - which are only subtly (although importantly) different - our systems incorrectly applied that fact check to the real photo, too. Our teams worked to quickly correct this mistake.""

Meta spokesperson Andy Stone also clarified in a Friday post on X that Zuckerberg has never endorsed a candidate in the 2024 presidential election: ""Mark's already been public about the fact that he's not endorsing either candidate, just as he hasn't in prior elections,"" Stone wrote. The company didn't comment further.

Additionally, Meta's AI chatbot initially refused to answer questions about the shooting.

Kaplan said that while neither error ""was the result of bias, it was unfortunate,"" and the company understands ""why it could leave people with that impression."" Kaplan attributed the issue to the mass amounts of information in a breaking news situation that can overwhelm an AI chat feature.

2024-08-05,0.051,"Washington -- Congressional Republicans, led by Michigan U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg, have introduced bills to reverse ambitious new vehicle fuel economy regulations issued by the Biden administration.

The administration's Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, commonly known as CAFE, were finalized in June and would require automakers' new vehicle fleets to achieve an average fuel economy of 53.5 miles per gallon by 2032.

""The extreme (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) CAFE standards are the latest attempt by the Biden-Harris administration to strip away choice from American consumers and mandate EVs,"" the Tipton Republican said in a statement about his bill.

Though the in-the-weeds technicalities of regulatory affairs aren't usually popular household issues, rules affecting the future of the U.S. auto industry have become a mainstay of the 2024 presidential election.

Republicans -- headlined by presidential nominee Donald Trump -- have consistently railed against President Joe Biden's efforts to significantly curb tailpipe emissions and encourage a shift toward electric vehicles as ways to fight climate change and keep pace with China's emergence as the world's leading EV maker.

Biden and his allies, meanwhile, have cheered the CAFE standards and similar efforts as smart for consumers' wallets and prudent for the future of the auto industry.

""Not only will these new standards save Americans money at the pump every time they fill up, they will also decrease harmful pollution and make America less reliant on foreign oil,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in June. ""These standards will save car owners more than $600 in gasoline costs over the lifetime of their vehicle.""

More: Biden scales back fuel economy standards amid tough political and business realities

Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is leading a companion push on the Senate side to cancel the CAFE standards. The bills in both chambers invoke the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to rescind regulations shortly after they're finalized.

The effort is unlikely to succeed in the current politically divided Congress.

However, Republicans might be able to revive the action early next year if they win control of both chambers and the White House in November. That is due to a so-called lookback provision in the CRA that allows Congress to revisit late-passing rules from a previous presidential administration.

The highly-anticipated trigger date for the lookback period will not be final until at least one chamber of Congress adjourns for the year.

More like this: Trump pledge to reverse Biden's EV push won't be so easy, experts say. Here's why

All regulations finalized after that date -- on average July 18, per a report from the Administrative Conference of the United States -- would be open to renewed challenges if Republicans manage to sweep the general elections.

That would keep the June 7 fuel economy standards safe from a later CRA challenge, though some observers think the window will close earlier this year.

The CAFE rule is one of many actions from Biden meant to reduce the environmental impact of consumer vehicles, which make up about 16% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, per EPA data.

His administration has devoted considerable time and resources to the matter, employing incentives and punitive regulations that push the auto industry toward electrification.

Other efforts have included two other key rules aimed at reducing tailpipe emissions; a $7,500 tax credit on qualifying new EV purchases via the climate-minded Inflation Reduction Act; $7.5 billion for EV charger buildout via the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law; IRA-funded manufacturing subsidies to repurpose old industrial centers for EVs; and a set of new tariffs that aim to protect U.S. automakers from competition with China, which has emerged as the world leader in EVs.

More: Voters want Michigan to build EVs, but they don't want to buy them, poll finds

Republicans have roundly opposed those efforts.

""The Biden-Harris administration has declared war against affordable gas-powered cars,"" Cruz said in a statement, alluding to Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. ""I'm leading the effort in the Senate to stop radical environmentalists from both abusing the rulemaking process and trying to force electric vehicles on consumers who do not want them.""

""Unlike the Biden-Harris administration, Republicans continue to fight for consumers and innovators to have the ability to shape the future of the auto industry,"" Walberg added, ""not just unelected bureaucrats issuing radical mandates from Washington."""

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.

Supreme Court shuts down Missouri's long shot push to lift Trump's gag order in hush-money case

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court has shut down a long-shot push from Missouri seeking to remove a gag order in former President Donald Trump's hush-money case and delay his sentencing in New York. The decision comes Monday after the Missouri attorney general had argued in the unusual request that the New York gag order wrongly limits what the GOP presidential nominee could say on the campaign trail and Trump's eventual sentence could affect his ability to travel. New York countered that the limited gag order does allow Trump to talk about the issues important to voters, and the sentence may not affect his movement at all.

What's the deal with the Olympics? Your burning questions, answered

PARIS (AP) -- The Olympics have their own language, traditions and rules. And they are ever-evolving. It can be a lot to take in. The Associated Press is answering some of the most asked questions about the Paris Games. What's in the box that athletes get with their medals? An official poster, meaning they can skip the gift shop. And if you wanted to know why the PARIS Olympics are in so many different cities, it's a combination of factors including space and appropriate facilities. It's also not uncommon among Olympics."
2024-08-05,0.0824,"Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson's office said it will investigate a political action committee backed by Elon Musk.

""Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has said he created and helped fund the America PAC, which is supporting former President Donald Trump,"" CNBC wrote.

Reuters noted that Musk said he created a PAC ""focused on supporting candidates but has not pledged anything to anyone.""

Benson's office said it's looking into the acquisition of voter information.

""Every citizen should know exactly how their personal information is being used by PACs, especially if an entity is claiming it will help people register to vote in Michigan or any other state,"" a spokeswoman for the Michigan secretary of state's office told CNBC.

""While the America PAC is a federal political action committee, the Department is reviewing their activities to determine if there have been any violations of state law. We will refer potential violations to the Michigan Attorney General's office as appropriate,"" the spokeswoman added.

Per CNBC:

The committee has been acquiring detailed voter information from those living in Michigan and other battleground states after people submit their personal data through a section on the PAC's website that says ""register to vote.""

After clicking on the ""register to vote"" tab on America PAC's website, users in states like Michigan can submit a ZIP code, address and phone number. People with a Michigan address are brought to a page that says ""thank you"" and asks users to ""complete the form below"" to help wrap up the voter registration process. As of Sunday afternoon, though, there was no other form to complete below the words ""thank you.""

The Michigan Department of State is currently in the early stages of investigating the situation and cannot confirm if the focus is on any specific aspect at this time, the spokesperson added.

The Michigan Attorney General's office and America PAC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk could not be immediately reached for comment.

Musk, the world's richest person, has publicly endorsed Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential race.

2024-08-05,0.302,"Past comments by VP pick J.D. Vance criticizing Simone Biles pausing her Olympic career for mental health have gone viral.

American gymnast Simone Biles was golden at the 2024 Summer Olympics, winning a total of three gold medals and one silver medal, helping set new records for her team along the way.

The success of Biles comes after the 2020 Olympics, which saw the gymnast unexpectedly step down for a mental health break, something that now vice-presidential pick J.D. Vance was critical of at the time.

What Happened: Biles was one of the most anticipated athletes making their return to the 2024 Summer Olympics, which have aired on Comcast Corp CMCSA-owned NBC and streamed on Peacock since the games began on July 26.

The American gymnast helped her team win the all-around gymnastics team gold medal and also took home the gold for the individual all-around, adding to her many accomplishments in the Summer Olympics and world competitions. With the medals she has won at the 2024 Olympics, her career total is now seven golds, two silvers and two bronze medals.

Biles is now the most decorated U.S. gymnast in Olympic history and has the most gold medals among U.S. gymnasts. The wins at the 2024 Summer Olympics also helped Biles become the oldest all-around champion (27 years of age) in 72 years and the first two-time all-around winner since 1968. Biles is also the first gymnast to ever win the individual all-around eight years apart.

In the 2020 Summer Olympics, Biles unexpectedly dropped out during the team performance, which the U.S. team won a silver medal.

Biles dropped out to focus on her mental health and said she had a case of the twisties, where her body and mind were not aligned, and put an emphasis on her safety over continuing to compete.

The move was praised by many athletes and Biles' sponsors, but a man running for U.S. Senate at the time took exception to the praise for the gymnast.

""I think it reflects poorly on our sort of therapeutic society that we try to praise people, not for moments of strength, not for moments of heroism, but for their weakest moments,"" J.D. Vance said in an interview at the time.

Vance was critical of how Biles was being perceived by the public.

""We've tried to turn a very tragic moment, Simone Biles quitting the Olympic team, into this act of heroism.""

Now the vice-presidential pick for the 2024 election alongside Donald Trump, past comments by Vance have gone viral during the 2024 Summer Olympics.

Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Aida Ross said Vance has no room to talk about ""anyone else's weakest moments,"" as reported by the New York Times.

""While the rest of the country is celebrating the U.S.A. women's gymnastics team's performance at the Olympics, J.D. Vance is facing his weakest moment amid a gaffe-filled rollout that has left him as the most unpopular V.P. pick in decades,"" Ross said.

Why It's Important: The past criticism from Vance could paint a picture of his lack of support and empathy for those dealing with mental health issues and comes at a time when Olympic athletes are being celebrated.

Biles had therapy sessions with her U.S.-based therapist during the Olympics, according to the report.

""The Olympics is such a draining process for the athletes when it's multiple days of competition, so you definitely have to be on top of your mental, as well as your physical,"" Biles said.

Biles also said that past negative comments were painful at the time and hurtful, but the people who criticized her are now ""really quiet.""

""After all these years of putting the mental work in, it's paid off.""

While sponsors have dropped athletes for performance issues or for off-the-field issues, Biles saw support from some of her biggest sponsors after dropping out of the 2020 Summer Olympics.

""We stand by Simone and support her well-being both in and out of competition,"" Athleta said at the time. ""Being the best also means knowing how to take care of yourself.""

Athleta, which is owned by Gap Inc GPS, landed Biles to a deal in 2021 pulling her away from apparel giant Nike Inc NKE. Biles said at the time that Athleta aligned better with her values and came as the larger apparel company was facing accusations of poor treatment towards female athletes.

Sponsor Visa Inc V also supported Biles after she withdrew from the 2020 games saying the gymnast was ""incredibly brave.""

Coca-Cola Co KO-owned Core Power said Biles showed that ""her courage and strength extend well beyond the mat"" at the time.

The brands that stuck by Biles were supportive again in the 2024 Olympics, with Coca-Cola making the gymnast the face of its Powerade brand's Olympic campaign. A commercial called ""The Vault,"" featured Biles navigating challenges and triumphs in life. The Powerade brand put an emphasis on athletes' mental and physical wellbeing with its Olympic sponsorship and launched its ""Pause is Power"" platform in 2022.

While Vance will either win or lose in the 2024 presidential election, Biles is very much already a winner in 2024 and one of the most celebrated American Olympic athletes ever.

2024-08-05,-0.0353,"The image of Ryan Reynolds appears to be created with artificial intelligence. Reynolds has not yet publicly endorsed a candidate in the 2024 presidential election.

With the 2024 presidential election around the corner, celebrities have voiced their support for Republican nominee former President Donald Trump or presumptive Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris.

An image recently went viral on social media appearing to show ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" star Ryan Reynolds wearing a t-shirt that says ""Kamala removes nasty orange stains,"" in the shape of a Tide logo, referencing Harris and Trump.

Some people who commented on the photo claimed the image is fake.

Is the image of Ryan Reynolds wearing a Kamala Harris shirt real?

No, the image of Ryan Reynolds wearing a Kamala Harris shirt isn't real.

The image of Ryan Reynolds wearing a Kamala Harris shirt isn't real. There are signs this image was likely created using artificial intelligence.

Generative AI is a technology that can produce new content, including images, videos, audio and text based on a prompt.

VERIFY analyzed the image and determined there are a number of visual cues that it is fake.

The hands on what appears to be Reynolds' body are misshapen and pixelated, with the knuckles on the thumb protruding more than normal. His skin looks too smooth in several places and his ears in the viral photo are much smaller than Reynolds' real ears. There is also a shadow under his jaw line onto his neck that does not look realistic. Reynolds appears to be wearing a watch, but a closer look shows the watch face is covered with pink dots.

Reynolds' nose in the viral image does not match real pictures of him. There is also a tattoo on the left forearm in the viral image, which appears misshapen and cut off. Reynolds doesn't have a tattoo there. On Instagram, he has posted several images while wearing short sleeve shirts and a similar tattoo can't be seen in any of them.

A close look at the shirt in the viral image also contains clues that it's likely AI-generated. Even though the shirt is wrinkled, the image looks flat. The image's colors are much more vibrant than anything else in the photo, and the shirt's black color appears to bleed down one side of Reynolds' arm - another sign of an AI-generated photo.

VERIFY also conducted a reverse image search using RevEye and found no reputable sources have published the photo of Reynolds wearing a Harris shirt. That is another indicator this image is made with artificial intelligence. Reynolds is a high-profile celebrity and if he was seen wearing this shirt, it would have been covered by the media.

Reynolds has also not publicly endorsed a candidate in the current presidential election. Reynolds was born and raised in Canada and became a U.S. citizen in 2018. He voted for the first time in the 2020 election, but did not share who he voted for.

VERIFY reached out to Reynolds' camp for comment and did not hear back at the time of publication."
2024-08-05,0.051,"Kyle Rittenhouse is creating a stir online among Donald Trump's supporters for declaring that he would not vote for the former president in the 2024 presidential election, then walking back that statement.

Rittenhouse posted a video to his X account on Thursday, Aug. 1, stating that he'd be writing in former Texas congressman Ron Paul on the ballot rather than Trump.

""Unfortunately, Donald Trump had bad advisors making him bad on the Second Amendment and that is my issue. If you can not be completely uncompromisable on the Second Amendment, I will not vote for you and I will write somebody else in,"" Rittenhouse said. ""We need champions for the Second Amendment or our rights will be eaten away and eroded each day. I support my decision and I have no takebacks.""

His declaration seemed absolute, but a mere 12 hours later he deleted his post and walked back his statements.

""My comments made last night were ill-informed and unproductive. I'm 100% behind Donald Trump and encourage every gun owner to join me in helping send him back to the White House,"" Rittenhouse wrote in a follow-up post.

The 21-year-old is widely known for shooting three protesters, killing two of them, during a racial justice protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in 2020. Jurors cleared the then-17-year-old of all the charges, including intentional homicide, after his attorneys argued he acted in self-defense.

Many Trump operatives and rightwing politicians praised the verdict, so his proclamation that he would vote for Ron Paul, a now-retired politician, came as a shock to many MAGA supporters.

Ron Paul served in the House of Representatives in the 1970s and 1980s and then from 1997 to 2013. He launched three unsuccessful bids for president -- one in 1988 as a Libertarian and then two in 2008 and 2013 when he sought the Republican nomination, according to his biography on the Congress website.

Many who back Trump condemned Rittenhouse as ""treasonous"" in light of all the support the former president's camp has given him in recent years.

""Treasonous Kyle Rittenhouse has apologized for his blasphemous statements about our glorious MAGA Movement,"" one X user wrote.

""Just remember, when it was political poison to take your side, Trump and MAGA was there for you during your lowest point,"" another person wrote.

In the years since the acquittal, Rittenhouse has fashioned himself as a gun rights activist.

He went on a controversial tour earlier this year to speak to students at three different colleges about ""the importance of the Second Amendment and the lies of (Black Lives Matter)."" News of his scheduled appearances was met with opposition by many students, and massive protests broke out when he visited the campuses."

NEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsened and set off another sell-off for financial markets around the world. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%.

But worries are still high after Friday's report showing U.S. employers pulled back on hiring last month by more than expected.

Tropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia and the Carolinas

HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with torrential rain and high winds, contributing to at least four deaths as it turned menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatened to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities. The storm made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 50 mph. More than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia. Local leaders in Savannah, Georgia, were preparing for high water in case Debby stalls out over the city. An official in Charleston, South Carolina, says Debby could be a ""historic and potentially unprecedented event.""

Google illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. After reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Ex-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped

PHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people charged in the case have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Rudy Giuliani at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She had pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.

Kamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.

In Israel and Lebanon, life goes on even as the region teeters on the edge of all-out war

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- In Beirut, shops are open and traffic is as snarled as ever. In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Everyone expects that an all-out war would be far more devastating than any previous conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.

Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Everyone expects that an all-out war would be far more devastating than any previous conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.

Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.

Supreme Court shuts down Missouri's long shot push to lift Trump's gag order in hush-money case

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court has shut down a long-shot push from Missouri seeking to remove a gag order in former President Donald Trump's hush-money case and delay his sentencing in New York. The decision comes Monday after the Missouri attorney general had argued in the unusual request that the New York gag order wrongly limits what the GOP presidential nominee could say on the campaign trail and Trump's eventual sentence could affect his ability to travel. New York countered that the limited gag order does allow Trump to talk about the issues important to voters, and the sentence may not affect his movement at all.

U.S. stocks took a nosedive on Monday amid a worldwide stock market selloff as fears of a possible U.S. recession have mounted in recent days.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1,033.99 to close at 38,703, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 3.43 percent and closed at 16,200. The S&P 500 slid 3 percent.

Already on Monday, Japan's Nikkei 225 index nosedived about 12 percent, the worst rout in its history, Japan's Topix index fell 12.2 percent. Yields on U.S. government bonds hit multi-month lows, with the 10-year note last at 3.68 percent, while the two-year slipped to 3.69 percent.

A weak jobs report from the U.S. Department of Labor last week coupled with shrinking manufacturing activity in the world's largest economy as well as dismal forecasts from top U.S. technology companies pushed the Nasdaq 100 lower as well.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs also noted the Fed's ability to boost market optimism, estimating a 25 percent likelihood of a U.S. recession, whereas JPMorgan analysts were more bearish, assigning a 50 percent probability to a recession. ""Now that the Fed looks to be materially behind the curve, we expect a [basis points] cut at the September meeting, followed by another 50 [basis points] cut in November,"" said economist Michael Feroli.

Major Wall Street brokerages also revised their Federal Reserve rate projections for 2024 to show greater policy easing by the central bank.

""I don't think the Fed would go 50 basis points because at the same time it would imply that the Fed was wrong, that a recession is right around the corner and it would do more to increase investor tension than it would to calm nerves,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. ""If anything, I would say that the Fed might engage in an intra meeting, easing of 25 basis points to let the markets know that it is on top of the issue.""

On Monday morning, Chicago Fed President Austan Goosbee said in a CNBC segment that the U.S. central bank would react to signs of weakness in the economy, indicating that interest rates are too high.

""The Fed's job is very straightforward, maximize employment, stabilize prices and maintain financial stability. That's what we're going to do,"" Goosbee said during CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" show. ""We're forward-looking about it. So if the conditions collectively start coming in like that on the through line, there's deterioration on any of those parts, we're going to fix it.""

On Aug. 2, the Labor Department said that nonfarm payrolls increased by 114,000 and the unemployment rate increased to 4.3, worse than expected.

But Goosbee said that he does not believe the numbers forecast a recession. ""Jobs numbers came in weaker than expected, but [are] not looking yet like recession,"" he said on the program. ""I do think you want to be forward-looking of where the economy is headed for making the decisions.""

If the United States enters recession territory, it could roil the already tumultuous 2024 presidential election, which has already seen an assassination attempt and the leading Democrat candidate, President Joe Biden, suspend his reelection campaign in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris. Former President Donald Trump has already deployed messaging related to the U.S. economy and will likely do so as the November election nears.

Reacting to the stock market drop, the former president suggested on his Truth Social platform that the current presidential administration is to blame. ""I told you so!"" he wrote in an all-capitalized message.

The Dow Jones's worst drop in history in terms of points came during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, in early 2020. At that time, it plunged 2,997 points on March 16, 2020, or 12.9 percent.

Other than the Great Depression's start in 1929, the worst U.S. stock market crash came on Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones plunged 22.6 percent in what is now known as ""Black Monday."""
2024-08-05,0.4353,"Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia greeting Nene Sakite of Lower Manya Krobo during his tour of the constituency

The atmosphere in the Asuogyaman, Lower Manya and Yilo Krobo constituencies was electrifying when the flagbearer of the ruling New Patriotic Party, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, visited them.

Unlike in the past, thousands of people trooped to the various meeting grounds to listen to the message of Dr. Bawumia amidst cheers and applause.

The unprecedented crowd were treated to various songs composed by different musicians for the NPP's 2024 campaign which has kicked off in earnest.

The Vice President used the occasion to explain to the mammoth crowd his policy proposals and urged them to vote for not only him as president but the parliamentary candidates on the ticket of the NPP.

Dr. Bawumia emphasized that a vote for him would translate into ""bold solutions,"" while a vote for his main opponent, former President John Mahama, meant ""a vote for old solutions.""

Dr. Bawumia highlighted his achievements as Vice President, including resolving generational issues, and promised to do more as president.

He outlined his new ideas and bold solutions, such as a new tax system, training one million young Ghanaians in coding and software applications, revising the National Service Scheme, and implementing a Ghana Card for passport policy.

The NPP Flagbearer also compared the records of the NPP and NDC, showcasing the NPP's superior achievements in education, economic indicators, healthcare, tourism, sports infrastructure, digitalization, and more.

He highlighted the NPP's flagship programs, including Free SHS, One District One Ambulance, expanded health insurance, free basic education and school feeding, District Road Improvement Program, LEAP, and reinstated nurses and teacher training allowances.

Dr Bawumia also emphasized the NPP's commitment to security, recruitment of over 30,000 personnel, and the One District One Factory initiative, which has created jobs and stimulated local economies.

He urged the party's rank and file to work hard to win the 2024 presidential election and parliamentary majority.

Dr. Bawumia's message was clear: he is the candidate with bold solutions for Ghana's future, and the NPP has a proven track record of transforming the lives of Ghanaians across the country.

""We are poised to vote for the NPP this time around because we believe Bawumia has the solutions that can change the destiny of this country,"" a young lady who had come to witness the event stated.

Another constituent had this to say: ""The number of people who came out to see Dr. Bawumia are extraordinary huge. It has never happened here before that NPP will be here and you see all these people coming out. Things will definitely change for the party in the December elections""."

Vitaliy Ryumshin discusses why Joe Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race does not change the balance of power in the U.S.

There have been some surprising developments in the U.S. presidential race. In an unprecedented move, President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the race on July 21, just a few weeks before he was expected to become the Democratic Party's nominee. This decision came after a Democratic uprising following Biden's poor showing in a televised debate with Donald Trump. Subsequently, many of the president's allies pushed him to drop out. Biden resisted until the last moment, but eventually, he was forced to step aside when nearly the entire Democratic leadership turned against him.

While the Democratic camp was in disarray, the situation significantly improved for Trump. First, the Republican nominee prevailed over his opponent in the debate, and then the U.S. Supreme Court issued favorable rulings in several major criminal cases Trump faces. Following this, Trump miraculously escaped assassination and spoke at a triumphant Republican National Convention just two days later. Adding to this, Biden is now out of the race. So, it seems that nothing can stop Trump from returning to the White House.

But is that really the case? Well, if you're a Trump fan, you're in for a disappointment: Biden's departure does not guarantee his opponent will be reelected.

Indeed, the former president still faces many problems. Trump is enmeshed in never-ending scandals, his approval rating remains stubbornly low, and he has failed to unite the country, although recently, he seemed to make some progress toward that end. Moreover, in May and June, people had hoped that the former president had matured politically. After all, Trump reconciled with moderate Republicans, attended the Libertarian Party convention, and aligned himself with the Silicon Valley tech giants who had previously supported the Democrats. However, it all crumbled when he named radical Trumpist Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance as his running mate. That's when it became clear that for Trump, ideological affinity and personal loyalty were still more important than political shrewdness.

So far, Trump has been able to cleverly hide his incompetence behind Biden's shortcomings. Indeed, Biden had behaved strangely at public events and, at times, made utterly no sense. America talked about nothing other than Biden's deteriorating health, which was getting worse by the month. Against this backdrop, an upbeat Trump looked like a worthy alternative.

Now that Biden is no longer in the race, his vice president, Kamala Harris, is getting ready to run against the Republican nominee. She is a relatively young (59-year-old) Black woman with Indian ancestry. People consider her modern enough to become a TikTok phenomenon and she is relatively popular with independent voters, minorities and young people. In contrast, Trump now seems like America's grandfather in chief, someone who should retire.

Trump needs to offer voters more than just the promise of clear thinking and staying healthy if he is to maintain his momentum.

Meanwhile, the Democrats are also facing challenges. They made a significant mistake by fully committing to a risky Biden nomination, which almost caused a rift in the party. However, after dealing with this crisis, the Democratic Party has pinned its hopes on Harris, a highly questionable candidate.

Indeed, Harris has many shortcomings. She lacks charisma and public speaking skills, and her speeches are word salads. Her awkward jokes and uncontrollable laughter have turned her into a meme.

Moreover, her track record is far from perfect. Harris unsuccessfully ran for president in 2019, losing in the Democratic primaries due to a poorly organized campaign. As vice president, she struggled to handle the immigrant crisis and alienated 90% of her staff with her toxic behavior. In the last few years, Harris' role has been reduced to occasionally standing in for Biden at events he didn't wish to attend.

Therefore, by all accounts, Harris should never have become a successful politician. Americans seem to agree. Her approval rating is lower than Biden's, and her disapproval rating is comparable to Trump's. However, despite her shortcomings, Democrats have consistently promoted her within the party, possibly because she is the ultimate diversity, equity and inclusion candidate.

Now Harris is faced with the challenge of reviving the Democratic presidential campaign as quickly as possible. This includes selecting a running mate, distancing herself from Biden, and combating racism and sexism, which are deeply ingrained in American society. Accomplishing this will require precise and well-coordinated efforts from a large team, significant funding, and minimal mistakes from Harris herself. While she will have access to the necessary resources, there are concerns about whether, given her track record, Harris will use them effectively. It's important to note that Harris did not independently participate in the primaries, which may lead some to think of her as the candidate no one chose.

As such, the crucial point is that what appeared to be significant changes in American politics have not produced any actual results.

The U.S. presidential election may change in its details, but the general situation remains the same. It's a contest between the bad and the worst, between the intolerable and the incompetent. And whoever wins the 2024 presidential election won't necessarily be the one who most deserves it, but the one who disgraces themselves the least."

Representative Jamie Raskin's (U-MD) son, Tommy Raskin killed himself right after the 2020 election at the age of 25. Congressman Raskin was diagnosed with cancer in 2022, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

Raskin is an angry bitter man of intemperate disposition, the archetype nihilist. As hate consumes him, his physical persona changes with the manifestation of evil enterprise. While his cancer is in reported remission, I would anticipate it to resurface in early 2025, after Baal has finished using him.

All of that said, Raskin is pledging to purposefully trigger a civil war within the United States if Donald Trump wins the 2024 presidential election. {Direct Rumble Link Here} Raskin is prepared to work with Democrats and block any certification of any vote that has President Trump declared the winner.

The basic auspices of this nonsensical 14th Amendment, Section 3, argument is that congress can block any person from office who was a federal officer and previously swore an oath to the constitution, then engaged in rebellion and insurrection. It's the same lawfare argument used by Colorado, Maine and Illinois in an attempt to keep President Trump off the ballot.

The supreme court ruled that states cannot trigger Section 3 of the 14th Amendment:

""No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability."" ~ [Citation]

Raskin sat on the House Select Jan. 6 Committee, and also served as an impeachment manager during the second impeachment effort against President Trump over the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. ""The House of Representatives already impeached Donald Trump for participating in insurrection by inciting it,"" Raskin previously said.

Watch this guy. Raskin throws around ""civil war"" like it's a willy-nilly disposable line without the major consequences he would trigger."

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. After reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Ex-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped

PHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people charged in the case have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Rudy Giuliani at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She had pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.

Kamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official.

It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.

In Israel and Lebanon, life goes on even as the region teeters on the edge of all-out war

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- In Beirut, shops are open and traffic is as snarled as ever. In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Everyone expects that an all-out war would be far more devastating than any previous conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court has shut down a long-shot push from Missouri seeking to remove a gag order in former President Donald Trump's hush-money case and delay his sentencing in New York.

New York countered that the limited gag order does allow Trump to talk about the issues important to voters, and the sentence may not affect his movement at all.

2024-08-05,-0.0039,"CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) - Venezuela's opposition leaders are calling on the country's armed forces to abandon their support of President Nicolás Maduro and stop repressing demonstrators who have come out in force to dispute the leader's claim he prevailed in last Sunday's election.

The armed forces are traditionally the arbiter of political disputes in Venezuela and have been key to Maduro's grip on power ever since he took over the so-called Bolivarian revolution in 2013 from his mentor, the late Hugo Chávez.

So far, they've shown no signs of ditching Maduro even in the face of credible evidence presented by the opposition that it trounced the self-proclaimed socialist at the polls by a more than 2-to-1 margin.

In a message posted Monday on social media, Edmundo González - who the U.S. and a half dozen countries have recognized as the victor - and opposition leader Maria Corina Machado called on rank and file members of the security forces to rethink their loyalty.

""We appeal to the conscience of the military and police to put themselves on the side of the people and their families,"" the two wrote in a long message.

""We won this election without any doubt. It was an electoral avalanche,"" the two continued. ""Now it's up to all of us to respect the voice of the people.""

Authorities have declared Maduro the victor in last Sunday´s election but have yet to produce voting tallies to prove he won. The opposition claims to have collected records from more than 80% of the 30,000 polling booths nationwide showing it won.

Maduro announced Saturday that the government has arrested 2,000 opponents and at a rally in Caracas he pledged to detain more people and send them to prison. The post-electoral uprising has also claimed at least 11 deaths, according to Foro Penal, a Caracas-based human rights group.

González and Machado in their missive called on Venezuelans with family members serving in the security forces to urge their loved ones not to attack protesters and obey illegal orders. It said it would offer ""guarantees"" to soldiers who follow the constitution even while promising there would be no impunity for those behind abuses and following illegal orders.

Both González, a former diplomat, and Machado - who was barred by the government from running - have gone into hiding, saying they fear they will be arrested or killed. Maduro and his cadres have threatened to lock them both up.

As Venezuelans fight Maduro on the streets, pressure is also building internationally for the Venezuelan government to publish the full breakdown of the electoral results.

But so far, Maduro has instead asked the country's supreme court - which like all institutions in Venezuela is packed with loyalists - to review any claims of irregularities.

""Respect for popular sovereignty is what moves us to defend the transparency of the (election) results,"" Brazil´s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said Monday in a press conference alongside fellow leftist President Gabriel Boric of Chile.

Boric, who cast doubt on Maduro´s victory claim in an unexpectedly strong statement within hours of Venezuela´s July 28 election, told reporters that he and Lula discussed the situation in Venezuela on Monday, without elaborating. The leaders did not take questions and their carefully worded statements signaled how leftist leaders in the region are gingerly trying to show respect for Venezuela's sovereignty while voicing doubts about the official results.

A few of Maduro´s staunch allies - including Russia, China and Cuba - have applauded his victory. On Monday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian held a telephone call with Maduro and reiterated his congratulations and ""condemned any foreign interference in Venezuela´s internal affairs,"" Pezeshkian´s office said.

2024-08-05,-0.098,"Jacob Chansley at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, wearing horned headdress and carrying spear (Win McNamee/Getty Images).

With roughly 90 days to go until the 2024 presidential election, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Monday has agreed to give a spear and horned headdress back to convicted Jan. 6 rioter Jacob Chansley, also known as the ""QAnon Shaman.""

As Law&Crime previously reported, Chansley asked that the federal government ""return forthwith all property seized"" in connection with his arrest for breaching the U.S. Capitol. He also sought to reduce his period of supervised release from three years to 12 months. Prosecutors said while they did not believe the items should be returned because they were still considered evidence, if they gave them back, it would mean Chansley must assure the court there would be no further challenges to his criminal conviction.

In a 6-page order on Monday, Senior U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth wrote:

Defendant Jacob Anthony Chansley stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021. In that respect, he was like thousands of others that day. But he stood out to the entire world because of his ""unmistakable outfit"" of ""a horned coyote-tail headdress; red, white, and blue face paint; gloves; and no shirt."" [Citation omitted] In addition, he had armed himself with a serious weapon: ""a six-foot pole with an American flag ziptied to the shaft and a metal spearhead fixed to the top.""

Mr. Chansley has completed his prison sentence and much of his term of supervised release. Now, he has moved for the return of his property seized and still held by the government, including his spear and helmet. Since the government has not established that it still needs these items as evidence and has not sought their forfeiture, the Court will GRANT Mr. Chansley's motion.

Chansley was sentenced in November 2021 to 41 months in prison and 36 months supervised release. Originally facing six charges, he struck a plea deal and pleaded guilty to only one count: obstruction of an official proceeding, a charge recently narrowed by the U.S. Supreme Court in Fischer v. United States.

All told, Chansley was incarcerated for 11 months before being released to a halfway house in March 2023 so he could start his supervised release program. When he tried to end that early, prosecutors reminded Lamberth that though the judge was effusive with his praise of Chansley at sentencing -- he had called Chansley's mea culpa ""the most remarkable I've heard in 34 years"" and ""akin to the kind of thing Martin Luther King would have said"" -- it was just two years after that when the judge expressed a certain degree of buyer's remorse.

Lamberth had learned that Chansley gave interviews to the press that were a far cry from contrite; the defendant said that he regretted pleading guilty.

Lamberth acknowledged this in his Monday order as well as Chansley's subsequent appeal. That appeal didn't go far because Chansley withdrew it. But he then he moved to vacate his sentence, claiming he had new evidence to vindicate himself and further, that he had ""ineffective assistance of his plea counsel.""

That motion was denied and the judge reminded Chansley of that fact on Monday -- as well as his prior ""disappointment that 'Mr. Chansley has recanted the contrition displayed at his sentencing.'""

In a footnote of the order, Lamberth notably included a snippet of Chansley's statement from sentencing that had so moved the judge and came back to bite him later:

So I had to come to terms with the fact that I was in solitary confinement because of me, because of my decision. I broke the law, and if I believe in freedom, if I believe in law and order, if I believe in responsibility and accountability, then that means that I should do what Gandhi would do and take responsibility even and especially when it incriminates me,"" Chansley said at sentencing. ""No ifs, ands, or buts about it. That's what men of honor do. I am truly, truly repentant for my actions, because repentance is not just saying you're sorry. Repentance is apologizing and then moving in the exact opposite direction of the sin that you committed. And that's what I've been trying to do ever since I realized the magnitude of my error and the magnitude of my mistake. [I]n retrospect, I would do everything differently on January 6. In all honesty, I would do everything differently.

Though the ""QAnon Shaman"" will have his iconic spear and fur-lined helmet back, Lamberth was silent on Chansley's July request for an early release from supervised probation.

Instead, the judge said only that the government had failed to establish why Chansley's property was ""evidence"" at this stage and that it was not clear to him ""how Mr. Chansley could contest his conviction, as he has been sentenced, abandoned his direct appeal, and seen his § 2255 motion denied.""

""But even if the government may need to reprove Mr. Chansley's guilt, the government has not explained why it would need his property,"" Lamberth wrote, adding that it was not enough for prosecutors to suggest the government may ""eventually"" seek civil forfeiture.

While Chansley was the ""face of the riot,"" the judge wrote, and ""images of him at the Capitol on that day abound,"" three years have passed and prosecutors have ""never sought forfeiture of the property involved in the Capitol siege.""

""As there is voluminous video and photo evidence of Mr. Chansley's conduct, his property is of little utility for an investigation or prosecution and 'the United States' legitimate interests can be satisfied even if the property is returned ... The Court therefore finds that the retention of Mr. Chansley's property would be unreasonable,"" the judge wrote.

Prosecutors may have an ""interest"" in using ""the evidence of its choice,"" such as a weapon used to commit an offense, he added, and ""the government may well have been able to articulate a compelling reason to retain Mr. Chansley's property.""

""But when the government has vast amounts of other evidence, it cannot defeat a Rule 41(g) motion simply by asserting its desire to retain the evidence without giving any reasons,"" the judge wrote."
2024-08-05,0.0745,"Former President Donald Trump has suggested using Bitcoin or a ""crypto check"" to address the United States' staggering $35 trillion national debt.

During an interview on Fox News, Trump, the Republican Party's 2024 presidential nominee, praised the crypto industry and warned that America must innovate in the digital asset space to keep pace with other countries.

He even highlighted the potential role of Bitcoin in resolving the national debt crisis.

""Who knows, maybe we'll pay off our $35 trillion dollar [national debt], hand them a little crypto check, right? We'll hand them a little Bitcoin and wipe away our $35 trillion,"" he stated.

US Government Faces Mounting Debt

The former president's proposal comes at a time when the US government is facing significant challenges due to its mounting debt.

The continuous devaluation of the dollar, driven by excessive currency printing to service outstanding debts, has contributed to Bitcoin's rising value relative to fiat currency.

To illustrate the gravity of the situation, it took around 200 years for the US national debt to reach $1 trillion.

Today, the same amount is added to the debt approximately every three months due to deficit spending.

In June, about 76% of all income tax revenue was used to pay interest on the debt, making it one of the largest expenses in the US fiscal budget.

Bitcoin, with its supply-capped nature, could potentially siphon value from the current US dollar system, thereby averting a full-blown currency collapse similar to the Weimar Republic in the early 20th century.

Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has also echoed this sentiment, suggesting that establishing a Bitcoin reserve could help the government pay off its national debt as Bitcoin appreciates in value.

Lummis Proposes Bitcoin as Strategic Reserve

Moreover, Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced a bill to establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve in the United States.

The initiative aims to counteract the negative effects of rampant monetary printing and preserve the US's financial dominance in global markets and trade.

The Wyoming Senator has proposed that the US Treasury acquire 5% of Bitcoin's total supply and hold the decentralized asset for at least 20 years as a safeguard against monetary devaluation by the Federal Reserve and poor fiscal policy.

Notably, Trump's stance on cryptocurrencies has evolved over time.

Despite previously criticizing Bitcoin as a ""scam,"" he has recently changed his tune.

On June 14, he declared that he would end the Biden administration's ""war on crypto"" if elected president.

Trump had also previously criticized Biden for his harsh stance on cryptocurrencies, emphasizing that the United States should strive to be a leader in the crypto industry.

As reported, a survey conducted by the Harris Poll has revealed that one in three voters in the US consider a candidate's position on cryptocurrencies before making their voting decision.

Another survey conducted by leading crypto venture capital firm Paradigm reveals that Trump's poll numbers for the 2024 US Presidential Election enjoy significant support from the crypto community."
2024-08-05,0.0588,"Since 1908, the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc. and its members have made their marks across several industries and impacted communities and spaces.

Some influential members include Phylicia Rashad, Coretta Scott King, Rosa Parks, Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison, and Vice President Kamala Harris, according to ESSENCE.

Harris was officially sworn in as vice president of the United States on Jan. 20, 2021, making her the first woman, Black person, and South Asian American to be elected to the office. While this historical marker is noteworthy, it was not the beginning of her story.

A native of Oakland, CA, Harris' roots in education and public service start with the influence of her mother, Shyamala Gopalan. According to a profile from the White House, Gopalan earned her doctorate in 1964, the same year Harris was born, and worked as a breast cancer scientist.

Harris' father, Donald J. Harris, came to the United States from Jamaica to study economics at the University of California, Berkeley. He is currently a professor emeritus of economics at Stanford University.

Influenced by her mother and father's academic work, Harris graduated from Westmount High School near Montreal, Canada, where she moved with her mother after her parents divorced. Harris then began her collegiate studies back in the U.S. at Howard University. Attending one of the country's HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) was likely influenced by the cultural and social upbringings of her parents.

In her memoir, ""The Truths We Hold: An American Journey,"" she discusses her parents' work and participation during the Civil Rights movement as well as her mother's acknowledgment of raising her and her sister, Maya, as Black girls in America.

""My mother understood very well that she was raising two Black daughters,"" Harris wrote in the memoir. ""She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as Black girls, and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud Black women.""

During her time at the HBCU, Harris was affiliated with the College of Arts and Sciences Student Council, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc., and the debate team, per a Howard University profile.

Harris majored in political science and economics, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1986. She described her time at Howard as critical, naming them her ""formative years.""

""The thing that Howard taught me is that you can do any collection of things and not one thing to the exclusion of the other. You could be homecoming queen and valedictorian. There are no false choices at Howard,"" Harris stated via a Howard University profile.

Upon graduating from Howard, Harris attended law school at the University of California Hastings, College of Law.

While there in February 1989, Harris advocated for Black students after a Black History Month display was defaced with racial slurs. According to Politico, Harris stood before approximately 300 students, faculty, and staff, detailing the incident and demanding change.

Her law school education led her to become a prosecutor, state attorney general, U.S. senator of California, and vice president of the United States.

Harris is running a historic campaign for president of the United States. After President Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential election, Harris took over his campaign operation, leading to a surge in donations.

According to a separate Politico report, Harris' Democratic campaign now has $377 million in cash on hand, which is $50 million more than the Trump campaign.

Morehouse College alumni called the 1867 PAC. Additionally, Harris has experienced an uptick in support from members of the Divine Nine, which consist of the nine recognized Black Greek-letter organizations (BGLOs).

According to Inside Higher Ed, BGLO members, particularly Alpha Kappa Alpha, have rallied behind the vice president's campaign for president.

A large number of AKA members joined a 44,000-person Zoom call. The group, Win With Black Women, organized the gathering on the day President Biden withdrew from the presidential race. During this meeting, the organization raised $1.5 million for the Harris campaign, according to The New York Times."
2024-08-05,-0.2078,"Stocks tumbled over fears of a U.S. economic slowdown

A wave of anxiety rippled through financial markets yesterday. Stocks fell in the U.S. and around the world as investors zeroed in on signs of a slowing American economy.

The drop extended a sell-off that began on Friday after the U.S. released a jobs report that showed the highest level of unemployment in nearly three years. This deepened fears that the world's largest economy could be headed for slower growth.

In the U.S., the S&P 500 fell 3 percent, its worst day since September 2022. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index dropped 12.4 percent, its biggest one-day point decline. The FTSE 100, Britain's benchmark index, had its worst day since July 2023, falling just over 2 percent.

There were other factors at play in the plunge: concerns that tech stocks had run up too far, too fast, and that a strengthening yen could hurt the prospects of Japanese companies and some global traders. In the U.S., some questioned whether the Federal Reserve may have waited too long before cutting interest rates. Here's the latest on the market meltdown.

Time to sell? It's tough to do nothing during this kind of market turmoil. But in this case, it's your best option, Ron Lieber, our Your Money columnist, writes.

Bangladesh's leader resigned and fled

Crowds celebrated in the streets of Dhaka, the capital, yesterday after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country. The army chief said the military would oversee the formation of an interim government.

Hasina was forced out by weeks of protests that began peacefully and then transformed into deadly clashes with security forces. Almost 100 people were reported killed on Sunday, the deadliest day of the unrest.

Responding to the bloodshed, the protesters marched to Hasina's residence. Hasina fled in a helicopter, and a crowd stormed the building. Looters made off with furniture, bedding and potted plants. Hasina's current location isn't clear. She has family in both the U.S. and Britain.

Here's the latest.

Background: Hasina, 76, was one of the world's longest-serving female leaders. Under her rule, the economy grew quickly and the country saw rapid development. But she also jailed her political opponents and was criticized as an authoritarian.

What's next: Her departure doesn't guarantee easy days ahead. The process of agreeing on an interim government could be bumpy, Mujib Mashal, our South Asia bureau chief, writes.

Harris is poised to announce her running mate

The campaign to be Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate is reaching its final hours.

Three contenders -- Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona and Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota -- met with Harris in Washington on Sunday. After announcing her pick, Harris plans to hold a first rally with her new running mate in Philadelphia today.

Here's what else to know:

The elevation of Harris to the top of the Democratic ticket has transformed what had been a long slog into a fast-moving campaign. Analysts said that the timeline was likely to benefit Harris.

In a live interview with a video gamer, Donald Trump appeared to blame immigrants for the drop in global stock markets.

In a new book, Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker, said that her quiet but firm push for President Biden to withdraw had come down to one factor: The need to defeat Donald Trump.

Google illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. After reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Ex-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped

PHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people charged in the case have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Rudy Giuliani at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She had pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.

In Israel and Lebanon, life goes on even as the region teeters on the edge of all-out war

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- In Beirut, shops are open and traffic is as snarled as ever. In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Everyone expects that an all-out war would be far more devastating than any previous conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.

Supreme Court shuts down Missouri's long shot push to lift Trump's gag order in hush-money case

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court has shut down a long-shot push from Missouri seeking to remove a gag order in former President Donald Trump's hush-money case and delay his sentencing in New York. The decision comes Monday after the Missouri attorney general had argued in the unusual request that the New York gag order wrongly limits what the GOP presidential nominee could say on the campaign trail and Trump's eventual sentence could affect his ability to travel. New York countered that the limited gag order does allow Trump to talk about the issues important to voters, and the sentence may not affect his movement at all.

The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. After reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Ex-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped

PHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people charged in the case have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Rudy Giuliani at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She had pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.

Rally dates are set. Venues are chosen. The only thing missing for Harris' blitz is her VP choice

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.

Kamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.

In Israel and Lebanon, life goes on even as the region teeters on the edge of all-out war

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- In Beirut, shops are open and traffic is as snarled as ever. In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Everyone expects that an all-out war would be far more devastating than any previous conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.

Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.

Supreme Court shuts down Missouri's long shot push to lift Trump's gag order in hush-money case

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court has shut down a long-shot push from Missouri seeking to remove a gag order in former President Donald Trump's hush-money case and delay his sentencing in New York. The decision comes Monday after the Missouri attorney general had argued in the unusual request that the New York gag order wrongly limits what the GOP presidential nominee could say on the campaign trail and Trump's eventual sentence could affect his ability to travel. New York countered that the limited gag order does allow Trump to talk about the issues important to voters, and the sentence may not affect his movement at all.

2024-08-05,-0.4039,"A 66-year-old Virginia man is charged with threatening to burn Vice President Kamala Harris alive to see her suffer.

A prosecutor for the Western District of Virginia said Frank Lucio Carillo was in court Monday for a preliminary hearing over death threats he made against the vice president, who's also the Democratic party's nominee for president in November.

Using the name ""joemadarats1"" on his GETTER social media account, Carillo mentioned Harris nearly 20 times, prosecutors said. Some of those postings were menacing in nature including one claiming the 59-year-old politician would regret running for the presidency after he plucked ""out her eyes with a pair of pliers.""

Carillo is also accused of threatening to shoot anyone who tried to protect Harris in that July 27 post.

Another comment on the suspect's GETTER account calls for someone to incinerate the Democratic candidate.

""Kamala Harris needs to be put on fire alive,"" he wrote the same day, according to a Friday court filing. ""I will do it personally if no one else does it. I want her to suffer a slow agonizing death.""

Also last week, Carillo allegedly wrote to Harris ""Just for being a Democrat you're going to die.""

Law enforcement officers said in an affidavit they found a rifle and a handgun in the suspect's home Winchester, Virginia, home during a search last week. When police came to Carillo's door, he reportedly asked if their visit was ""about the online stuff"" and didn't deny posting the messages.

The 2024 presidential election is shaping up to be highly contentious. Republican candidate Donald Trump has recently escalated his attempts to draw attention to Harris being a woman of color.

He's also planted the seed that, if he loses in November, it will be because the election was somehow rigged. He made that same false assertion after being defeated handily by President Joe Biden in 2020.

Days before the Republican National Committee made Trump its presidential candidate for third straight time last month, a Pennsylvania gunman fired several shots at the 78-year-old Queens native at a rally, wounding the nominee's ear.

It remains unclear why the shooter, a 20-year-old registered Republican, attempted to assassinate the party's representative to lead the country.

Harris put out a statement condemning the ""abhorrent act"" that nearly killed her opponent.

2024-08-05,0.1608,"The crucial battleground state has been chosen as the location for her first big public event following the announcement of her running mate in the 2024 presidential election.

Democrats view Pennsylvania as a critical state for Harris. Although she could win the election without it, Pennsylvania's 19 Electoral College votes would give her a much easier path to the 270 needed to defeat former President Donald Trump.

The state is roughly divided between Democrats and Republicans, backing Trump in 2016 but flipping back to Democrats to support President Joe Biden in 2020.

Harris emerged as the Democratic presidential nominee after Biden withdrew from the race last month amid pressure from Democrats concerned about polls showing Trump leading key states, including Pennsylvania. Biden's poll numbers slipped following his debate against Trump in June, which fueled concerns about his age and ability to win in November.

For months, Harris polled similarly, or behind Biden. But her ascent to the top of the ticket sparked a wave of Democratic enthusiasm, and fundraising, that has shifted polls in her direction, giving Democrats more confidence about their ability to win.

A new poll of Pennsylvania voters released on Monday showed Trump trailing Harris in the Keystone State.

The GQR poll found Harris leading Trump by four percentage pints (50 percent to 46 percent). Two percent of respondents said they were leaning toward other candidates, and another two percent remained undecided, according to the survey.

It polled 500 likely voters from July 26 to July 30, 2024 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.38 percentage points.

The poll comes as Harris is set to hold a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday with her running mate, who is yet to be announced. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro is viewed as a front-runner to become her vice presidential candidate, due largely to his electoral success in the state in past elections.

Other polls have pointed to a tight race since Harris became the Democratic nominee. On Monday, FiveThirtyEight's polling aggregate showed the two candidates nearly tied, with Harris receiving average support of 45.3 percent and Trump averaging 44.4 percent.

A Fabrizio, Lee & Associates poll, conducted among 600 likely voters from July 29 to August 1, found the race tied. In a two-way race, each received 48 percent. When Kennedy was included, they each received 45 percent support, according to the poll.

Meanwhile, a Public Policy Polling survey, conducted among 627 registered voters from July 29 to 30, found Trump with a 1-point lead (48 percent to 47 percent).

A Public Opinion Strategies poll, conducted among 400 likely voters from July 23 to 29, found Harris with a 3-point lead (48 percent to 45 percent).

Newsweek reached out to the Harris and Trump campaigns for comment via email.

Harris and her running mate are expected to travel to the key swing states this week to continue building enthusiasm, as well as winning over undecided swing voters who could determine the outcome of the election.

In addition to Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina and Wisconsin are viewed as the most competitive states. Biden won all but North Carolina in 2020.

Biden carried Pennsylvania by only 1.2 points in 2020, winning 50 percent of the vote to Trump's 48.8 percent. In 2016, Trump won by an even smaller margin, winning 48.2 percent of the vote compared to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's 47.5 percent."
2024-08-05,0.2941,"The atmosphere in the Asuogyaman, Lower Manya and Yilo Krobo constituencies was electrifying when the flagbearer of the ruling New Patriotic Party, Dr. Mahaamudu Bawumia, visited them.

Unlike in the past, thousands of people trooped to the various meeting grounds to listen to the message of Dr. Bawumia amidst cheers and applause.

The unprecedented crowd were treated to various songs composed by different musicians for the NPP's 2024 campaign which has kicked off in earnest.

The Vice President used the occasion to explain to the mammoth crowds his policy proposals and urged them to vote for not only him as president but the parliamentary candidates on the ticket of the NPP.

Dr. Bawumia emphasized that a vote for him would translate into ""bold solutions,"" while a vote for his main opponent, former President John Mahama, meant ""a vote for old solutions.""

Dr. Bawumia highlighted his achievements as Vice President, including resolving generational issues, and promised to do more as president.

He outlined his new ideas and bold solutions, such as a new tax system, training one million young Ghanaians in coding and software applications, revising the National Service Scheme, and implementing a Ghana Card for passport policy.

The NPP Flagbearer also compared the records of the NPP and NDC, showcasing the NPP's superior achievements in education, economic indicators, healthcare, tourism, sports infrastructure, digitalization, and more.

He highlighted the NPP's flagship programs, including Free SHS, One District One Ambulance, expanded health insurance, free basic education and school feeding, District Road Improvement Program, LEAP, and reinstated nurses and teacher training allowances.

Dr Bawumia also emphasized the NPP's commitment to security, recruitment of over 30,000 personnel, and the One District One Factory initiative, which has created jobs and stimulated local economies.

He urged the party's rank and file to work hard to win the 2024 presidential election and parliamentary majority.

Dr. Bawumia's message was clear: he is the candidate with bold solutions for Ghana's future, and the NPP has a proven track record of transforming the lives of Ghanaians across the country.

""We are poised to vote for the NPP this time around because we believe Bawumia has the solutions that can change the destiny of this country"" a young lady who had come to witness the event stated.

Another constituent had this to say: ""The number of people who came out to see Dr. Bawumia are extraordinary huge. It has never happened here before that NPP will be here and you see all these people coming out. Things will definitely change for the party in the December elections""."
2024-08-05,-0.0745,"Google told House Republicans that various bugs prevented information about Donald Trump from auto-completing when users tried to search for information about the former president or the assassination attempt against him. The search engine also claimed those bugs caused searches for Trump to generate articles about Vice President Kamala Harris.

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, wrote Monday that the committee would meet with Google staff this week over concerns that ""Google may now be interfering in the 2024 presidential election by censoring information about former President Donald Trump.""

""Alphabet also admitted to the Committee and Select Subcommittee that Autocomplete was not showing President Trump's name in response to searches for 'President Donald' and similar terms. Alphabet claims 'that this particular issue was caused by a bug' and has been fixed by a recent update,"" Jordan wrote, in reference to Google's parent company.

Jordan called it a ""vague excuse"" and told Google to prepared to answer more specific questions, including ""How can the American people be confident that a similar issue, whether intentional or not, will not occur again?""

WATCH MICHAEL KNOWLES' INTERVIEW WITH 'GOOGLE'S WORST NIGHTMARE'

The commitee's letter to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said that Google had finally corrected the issue, where searching for information about attempted assassinations would return results about attempts on other presidents, but not Trump's.

The company faulted ""built-in protections around political violence"" that were ""out of date."" Regardless of the cause, search results were impacted from the July 13th shooting through at least July 29. Google told The Daily Wire at the time that, while the bug suppressed auto-complete, users could still access information about the assassination attempt by searching manually.

But even manual searches for Trump frequently ""returned news labels and stories about Vice President Harris,"" Jordan wrote.

""Alphabet claimed that this error was the result of its algorithm that automatically generates and displays labels about news topics related to a Google Search inquiry,"" Jordan wrote, noting that the company claimed search results ""may be unexpected or imperfect, and bugs will occur.""

Jordan suggested that the errors tended to favor one political party, asking ""Does the company seek to elevate liberal news outlets more prominently over conservative outlets in order to favor Democratic candidates? If not, what steps does the company take to audit how the algorithm is functioning?""

Jordan said Google has an ongoing obligation to produce to Congress documents pursuant to a February 2023 subpoena, even if the documents were created after the subpoena was received.

The Judiciary Committee has investigated political bias among big tech companies and digital advertisers, saying that an advertising association known as the Global Alliance for Responsible Media might have violated anti-trust laws by discouraging companies from advertising with conservative media sources and purporting to speak with one voice on behalf of advertisers in order to leverage changes in tech platforms that helped Democrats."

""I thought Trump displayed courage under fire, objectively. He just got shot. He's got blood streaming down his face, and he's fist pumping, saying 'fight.' That's impressive. You can't feign bravery in a situation like that,"" Musk said.

""I think you want someone who is strong and courageous to represent the country,"" he continued.

""But on balance, and certainly at the time, it was a choice of Biden. Poor guy has trouble climbing a flight of stairs, and the other one is fist pumping after getting shot. This is no comparison. I mean who do you want dealing with some of the toughest people and other world leaders who are pretty tough themselves?"" Musk explained.

""I think we want a secure border. We don't have a secure border,"" he noted.

""We want safe and clean cities,"" he added.

""I think we want to reduce the amount of spending we're, at least, slow down the spending because we're currently spending at a rate that is bankrupting the country,"" he continued.

""I think we've got to reduce the size of government, we've got to reduce the spending, and we've got to live within our means,"" he said.

Elon Musk Reveals 7 Reasons Why He's Voting for Donald Trump

1. @ElonMusk was astounded when Trump fist-pumped and shouted, ""Fight!"" shortly after getting shot in the face. ""You can't feign bravery in a situation like that,"" he said.

2. Musk seeks a leader ""who is strong and courageous to represent the country.""

3. He wants someone tough to deal with world leaders who are pretty tough themselves. ""Poor guy [Biden] has trouble climbing a flight of stairs, and the other one's first pumping after getting shot. This is no comparison.""

4. Musk wants ""a secure border. We don't have a secure border.""

5. He wants someone who can deliver ""safe and clean cities.""

6. Musk Thinks Trump is the better candidate to reduce spending. He's concerned about this issue because ""we're currently spending at a rate that is bankrupting the country.""

7. Musk aligns with Trump's vision to cut bureaucratic bloat. He wants someone who will ""reduce the size of government.""

2024-08-05,0.2314,"Following President Joe Biden's unexpected withdrawal from the 2024 US presidential race, Vice President Kamala Harris has emerged as the presumptive Democratic nominee. This development has sparked a whirlwind of activity within the Democratic Party as Harris seeks to solidify her position by selecting a running mate. Endorsements from influential figures like former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have bolstered her campaign, adding pressure to her upcoming decision. With an announcement expected by August 7, Harris and her team are meticulously vetting a range of potential candidates, each bringing unique strengths and challenges.

Harris is currently vetting several prominent Democrats for the vice-presidential slot. The candidates under consideration include Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Recently, Michigan Senator Gary Peters' name has also surfaced. Each of these individuals brings unique strengths and challenges to the table, and Harris' choice will reflect her strategic priorities for the campaign.

Harris faces the monumental task of securing victory in seven key swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. These states are crucial battlegrounds, and her choice of running mate will be scrutinized for its potential to sway voters in these regions.

Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania is a compelling candidate with strong credentials. However, his Jewish heritage could be a double-edged sword, particularly in Michigan, where a significant Arab and Muslim population might view his candidacy with skepticism due to concerns about his stance on Israel. Additionally, Shapiro's support for private school vouchers puts him at odds with public school advocates, which could further complicate his appeal.

Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona is another strong contender, but his potential nomination comes with significant risks. Should Kelly be chosen, he would have to resign from the Senate, allowing the Republican governor of Arizona to appoint a Republican successor. This would tip the balance of power in the Senate, a critical consideration for the Democratic Party.

Governor Roy Cooper of North Carolina has already withdrawn from consideration, narrowing the field. His decision underscores the complexities and personal calculations involved in the vice-presidential selection process.

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is a well-known figure with national recognition. However, his profile and policy positions may not necessarily complement Harris' strengths, raising questions about the overall balance of the ticket.

Senator Gary Peters of Michigan brings a long family history and a solid legislative record. Despite his historical ties and past electoral success, his recent dip in popularity and the narrow margin of his 2020 Senate victory suggest he may not significantly enhance Harris' electoral prospects in key swing states.

Governor Andy Beshear of Kentucky is noted for his progressive stance on voting rights, having restored the voting rights of over 140,000 former felons. While this move aligns with liberal values, it also raises concerns about the integrity of the voting system, a point that could be exploited by opponents.

Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota offers limited strategic value in terms of electoral math. Minnesota has consistently voted Democratic since 1972, and there is no clear indication that Walz would bolster Harris' chances in neighboring swing states like Wisconsin and Michigan.

One of Harris' most significant challenges is finding a running mate who offers ideological balance without alienating the Democratic base or conservative-leaning voters. The current field of candidates largely shares Harris' liberal views on key issues such as abortion rights, marijuana legalization, and gun control. This ideological alignment, while reinforcing party unity, risks alienating moderate and conservative Democrats who may find Trump's platform more appealing.

A notable gap among the potential running mates is the lack of substantial foreign policy and national security experience. In an election where global issues and international relations are likely to be prominent, this deficiency could be a critical weakness. Harris' campaign will need to address these concerns, possibly by emphasizing her own experience and strategic vision on the global stage.

Harris' eventual running mate will have to face Republican VP nominee JD Vance in debates. Vance has proven to be a formidable debater, adept at putting Democrats on the defensive. The Democratic ticket will need a candidate who can effectively counter Vance's attacks and articulate a compelling vision for the future.

The broader dilemma for the Democratic Party is the balancing act between progressive ideals and broader electoral appeal. The party's shift towards more left-wing policies could energize the base but risks alienating moderate voters. Harris' selection of a running mate will signal the party's strategic direction and its approach to addressing this ideological divide.

As Harris deliberates her choice, the stakes are high. The selected vice presidential candidate must not only help win crucial swing states but also present a unified front capable of addressing the nation's diverse and complex issues. The decision is further complicated by the need to balance liberal policies with broader electoral appeal.

Kamala Harris's vice presidential selection process is a pivotal moment in her campaign. Each potential candidate brings distinct advantages and disadvantages, and the final choice will significantly impact the Democratic Party's chances in the 2024 presidential election. With the announcement deadline looming, all eyes are on Harris as she navigates this critical juncture in her political career."

That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.

Supreme Court shuts down Missouri's long shot push to lift Trump's gag order in hush-money case

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court has shut down a long-shot push from Missouri seeking to remove a gag order in former President Donald Trump's hush-money case and delay his sentencing in New York. The decision comes Monday after the Missouri attorney general had argued in the unusual request that the New York gag order wrongly limits what the GOP presidential nominee could say on the campaign trail and Trump's eventual sentence could affect his ability to travel. New York countered that the limited gag order does allow Trump to talk about the issues important to voters, and the sentence may not affect his movement at all.

Google loses massive antitrust case over its search dominance

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. After reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Hundreds in Israel mark the 5th birthday of a child held hostage in Gaza

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Hundreds of Israelis have sent orange balloons into the air to mark the fifth birthday of one of two children held captive by militants in the Gaza Strip. Ariel Bibas, who along with his 1-year-old brother Kfir, has become a symbol of the struggle to release the hostages. The orange balloons are meant to symbolize Ariel and Kfir's bright red hair. During its Oct. 7 attack, Hamas killed 1,200 people and took some 250 people hostage, according to Israeli authorities. Among the 110 still held hostage, the Bibas boys are said to be the only children.

This preschool in Alaska changed lives for parents and kids alike. Why did it have to close?

WASILLA, Alaska (AP) -- In rural Alaska, the federally funded Head Start preschool program has helped parents earn college degrees. It has put parents with drug addictions on paths toward recovery and educated children who have ended up in foster care. And, of course, it has readied youngsters for kindergarten. So it was crushing when one of Alaska's Head Start providers closed two of its preschools. The program suffers nationally from a teacher shortage -- its teachers must have college degrees, and they can often earn more working in retail or at local school districts. The preschool closures in Alaska preview what other regions across the country could soon face.

At the Paris Olympics, it will no longer be personal for Ukraine's athletes. This time, it's war

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- For Ukrainian athletes, the Paris Olympics are more than just sports. They're a way to draw attention to their country's fight for survival against Russia -- a sort of war on another battlefield. But an Associated Press analysis found Russia's war is making it increasingly difficult for Ukraine, once a post-Soviet sports power, to get those headline-capturing medals. Ukrainian performances began dipping after 2014, the year of Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea. Ukraine's haul of 11 medals at the 2016 Rio Games was its smallest as an independent nation and it tumbled to a low of 22nd in the country rankings. Ukraine recovered to 16th at the pandemic-delayed Olympics in Tokyo in 2021 but just one of its 19 medals was gold -- another new low."

2024-08-05,-0.0118,"In the wake of President Joe Biden's decision to step aside, the Democratic Party finds itself at a crucial crossroads. As Vice President Kamala Harris emerges as the presumptive nominee for the 2024 presidential election, a complex debate is unfolding within progressive circles. While the threat posed by Republican nominee Donald Trump's potential return to power looms large, some prominent progressives, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, are hesitating to offer their immediate and unconditional endorsement of Harris. This reluctance has sparked criticism from certain quarters, but a closer examination reveals that this measured approach may be both strategically sound and necessary for the long-term health of the progressive movement.

By resisting calls for unconditional loyalty to party nominees, progressives are advocating for a more dynamic, responsive political system where ideas and policies are vigorously debated, even within party lines.

The stakes of the 2024 election cannot be overstated. Trump's potential return to the White House is widely viewed as an existential threat to liberal democracy. His previous term was marked by attempts to undermine democratic institutions, a disregard for the rule of law, and the emboldening of far-right extremism. The prospect of a second Trump term, potentially unconstrained by reelection concerns, sends shivers down the spines of many Americans, regardless of their position on the political spectrum.

Given these high stakes, the impulse to rally behind any Democratic nominee might seem natural. However, such unconditional support could prove counterproductive and potentially damaging to the long-term promotion of a genuine progressive agenda. To understand this perspective, it's essential to examine the delicate balance of power within the Democratic Party and the role that progressive pressure has played in recent years.

The Biden administration's most celebrated achievements -- from ambitious climate initiatives to student debt relief to massive infrastructure investment -- owe much to the persistent pressure exerted by progressive forces both inside and outside the government. The creation of a strong progressive voting bloc, coupled with grassroots movements and the strategic positioning of left-wing officials in key roles, has been instrumental in pushing the Democratic agenda leftward. These victories were not gifts bestowed by a benevolent party establishment but hard-won concessions extracted through sustained activism and political maneuvering.

The obvious fear among progressives is that without this constant pressure, the Democratic Party will inevitably gravitate back toward its corporate-friendly, centrist tendencies. Historically, the Democratic Party has maintained close ties with corporate interests and the military-industrial complex. While the party has made strides in recent years to address issues like income inequality and universal healthcare, these efforts often fall far short of the transformative changes needed to address systemic problems.

The influence of wealthy donors and corporate lobbyists remains a significant concern for progressives. As Sen. Sanders has long pointed out, the replacement of Biden as the nominee could potentially open the floodgates for even greater donor influence over the party's agenda. This fear is not unfounded, as evidenced by growing pressures from certain donors to replace Lina Khan, the current head of the Federal Trade Commission, who has been a leading figure in challenging big tech monopolies.

Vice President Harris' political evolution provides a case study in the tensions between progressive ideals and mainstream Democratic politics. As a presidential candidate in 2020, Harris embraced several progressive positions, including banning fracking and significant police reform. However, as she transitions into her role as the presumptive nominee, there are signs of a shift toward more centrist stances. Harris has begun to distance herself from some of her previous progressive positions in order to ""bolster a more moderate image."" This rightward drift is seen by many as an attempt to court moderate voters and assuage the concerns of corporate donors.

Interestingly, the only area where Harris seems to be maintaining a somewhat progressive stance is on the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Here, she has called for a more balanced approach, aligning with growing pressure from Democratic voters who support Palestinian rights and are demanding a cease-fire. This shift in the party's stance on Israel-Palestine provides a telling example of how progressive pressure can influence party positions. Harris's more nuanced approach, where while reconfirming US support for Israel she has also openly critiqued the number of civilian casualties, stands in contrast to the traditionally staunch pro-Israel stance of the Democratic establishment.

The fact that Harris has not fully abandoned this more balanced position on Israel-Palestine, even as she moves to the center on other issues, demonstrates the power of sustained progressive advocacy. It also underscores the importance of maintaining pressure on key issues rather than offering blanket support. The growing chorus of Democratic voters, particularly young people and progressives, demanding a ceasefire and a reevaluation of U.S. support for Israeli military actions has clearly had an impact on the party's rhetoric and policy positions.

The reluctance of some progressives to offer immediate, unconditional endorsement to Harris is not merely about ideological purity. It's a calculated strategy aimed at shaping the Democratic platform and ensuring that progressive priorities remain at the forefront of the party's agenda. By making their support conditional on commitments to key progressive policies, leftist leaders hope to prevent a wholesale abandonment of the transformative vision that has energized millions of voters, particularly young people.

This approach serves several strategic purposes. By withholding immediate endorsement, progressives retain bargaining power to influence the party platform and Harris's campaign promises. A vigorous debate within the party can actually serve to engage and motivate progressive voters, rather than suppressing turnout through a perception that their concerns are being ignored. Conditional support encourages specific, measurable policy commitments rather than vague platitudes. Moreover, by clearly articulating their expectations now, progressives lay the groundwork for holding a potential Harris administration accountable after the election.

While the threat posed by a potential Trump presidency is real and significant, offering unconditional support to any Democratic nominee carries its own set of risks. Without pressure from the left, there's a danger that the Democratic platform could shift even further to the center, abandoning key progressive priorities. Young and progressive voters, who have been crucial to recent Democratic victories, may become disillusioned if they perceive that their concerns are being sidelined. The transition period presents a unique opportunity to push for party reforms and policy commitments, and immediate, unconditional endorsement would squander this chance. Once full endorsement is given, progressives lose much of their leverage to influence the direction of the campaign and potential administration.

The progressive strategy of conditional support extends beyond mere party politics. It speaks to a broader vision of how democracy should function. By resisting calls for unconditional loyalty to party nominees, progressives are advocating for a more dynamic, responsive political system where ideas and policies are vigorously debated, even within party lines. This approach challenges the notion that party unity must come at the expense of ideological diversity and policy innovation. Instead, it posits that a healthy democracy requires constant negotiation and renegotiation of the social contract, with citizens and their representatives actively shaping the direction of governance.

As the 2024 election approaches, progressives find themselves walking a tightrope. On one side looms the very real threat of a Trump return to power, with all the democratic backsliding that would entail. On the other side is the risk of seeing hard-won progressive gains eroded by a Democratic Party that, absent continued pressure, may revert to its more corporate-friendly instincts. Withholding immediate, unconditional endorsement of Kamala Harris is not a rejection of the democratic process or an invitation for Trump to win. Rather, it's a sophisticated political strategy aimed at ensuring that the Democratic Party remains responsive to the needs and aspirations of its progressive base. In the end, the progressive movement's strength lies in its ability to both challenge and support the Democratic Party, pushing it toward a more equitable, sustainable, and just vision for America. By maintaining this tension, progressives hope to not just win an election, but to fundamentally transform the political landscape for generations to come.

Ultimately, while the strategy of conditional support for Democratic candidates like Kamala Harris serves immediate tactical purposes, it's crucial to recognize that true transformative change ultimately requires building an independent, mass progressive movement. This movement can strategically align with pro-corporate parties like the Democrats when necessary in the short term, but its long-term goal must be to fundamentally reshape the political landscape. By organizing outside traditional party structures, building grassroots power, and cultivating a clear vision for a more egalitarian, sustainable, and free world, progressives can work toward creating a political force that doesn't just influence existing parties, but eventually replaces them with something far better."

While Harris has secured enough delegates to become the Democratic nominee, delegates still have to participate in a ""virtual roll call"" to solidify her nomination.

Harris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a Tuesday night deadline. She's looking to officially claim the nomination on Monday evening when the DNC is expected to release final results.

Former Republican governor of New Jersey and Environmental Protection Agency administrator Christine Todd Whitman was among a handful of Republicans who backed Vice President Kamala Harris' bid for the White House.

Whitman, who was the first woman elected governor of New Jersey, has been a prominent critic of Donald Trump.

""I was a proud Republican, but Donald Trump is unfit to lead our nation,"" she said in a statement. ""It's time to move forward by electing Vice President Kamala Harris.""

Whitman has roots in the same county in New Jersey where Trump's Bedminster golf club is located. Whitman endorsed President Joe Biden in 2020 over Trump as well.

Harris postponing Georgia trip as Tropical Storm Debby moves across the region

Vice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.

Harris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.

Harris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been pulled down, for now.

Debby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to South Carolina and Georgia as it heads east.

Harris' nomination to become official after online balloting ends Monday night

Vice President Kamala Harris' nomination will become official after a five-day round of online balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates ends Monday night and the party announces the results. The party had long contemplated the early virtual roll call to ensure President Joe Biden would appear on the ballot in every state.

An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted after Biden withdrew found 46% of Americans have a favorable view of Harris, while a nearly identical share has an unfavorable view of her.

But more Democrats say they're satisfied with her candidacy compared with that of Biden, energizing a party that had long been resigned to the 81-year-old Biden being its nominee against former President Donald Trump, a Republican they view as an existential threat.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in court to fight lawsuit saying he falsely claimed to live in NY

Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. arrived at a New York court Monday to fight a lawsuit alleging he falsely claimed to live in New York as he sought to get on the ballot in the state.

Kennedy appeared and sat at his attorneys' table during legal arguments Monday morning, ahead of a civil trial expected to start later in the day in the state capital of Albany. Under state election law, a judge is set to decide the case without a jury.

The lawsuit alleges Kennedy's nominating petition falsely said his residence was in New York's northern suburbs while he actually has lived in Los Angeles since 2014, when he married ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" actor Cheryl Hines.

The suit seeks to invalidate his petition. The case was brought by Clear Choice PAC, a super PAC led by supporters of Democratic President Joe Biden.

Trump blames Harris and Biden for drop in markets

Former President Donald Trump is blaming Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden for the tumbling of markets in Wall Street and around the world.

Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, made a series of posts on his network Truth Social, attacking his opponent Harris.

""Kamala is even worse than Crooked Joe. Markets will NEVER accept the Radical Left Lunatic that DESTROYED San Francisco and California, as a whole,"" he wrote, and is labeling the plunging market the ""Kamala Crash.""

In another post, Trump called it a ""preview of the world markets without Donald J. Trump in the White House.""

The S&P 500 was down 3.1% in early trading with rising fears about a slowing U.S. economy. Japan's Nikkei 225 helped start Monday by plunging 12.4% for its worst day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.

Harris and her running mate -- whoever that is -- will launch into an aggressive, seven-state battleground tour that begins in Philadelphia on Tuesday and winds through Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada.

Her early rallies have attracted enthusiastic thousands. Campaign officials say each stop will be loaded with local election officials, religious leaders, union members and more in an effort to show the diversity of her coalition.

Campaign officials are aware that momentum can be fleeting and are working to capitalize on the energy now, while managing expectations by continuing to emphasize that the race with Republican nominee Donald Trump is tight.

2024-08-05,-0.4039,"A 66-year-old Virginia man is charged with threatening to burn Vice President Kamala Harris alive to see her suffer.

A prosecutor for the Western District of Virginia said Frank Lucio Carillo was in court Monday for a preliminary hearing over death threats he made against the vice president, who's also the Democratic party's nominee for president in November.

Using the name ""joemadarats1"" on his GETTER social media account, Carillo mentioned Harris nearly 20 times, prosecutors said. Some of those postings were menacing in nature including one claiming the 59-year-old politician would regret running for the presidency after he plucked ""out her eyes with a pair of pliers.""

Carillo is also accused of threatening to shoot anyone who tried to protect Harris in that July 27 post.

Another comment on the suspect's GETTER account calls for someone to incinerate the Democratic candidate.

""Kamala Harris needs to be put on fire alive,"" he wrote the same day, according to a Friday court filing. ""I will do it personally if no one else does it. I want her to suffer a slow agonizing death.""

Also last week, Carillo allegedly wrote to Harris ""Just for being a Democrat you're going to die.""

Law enforcement officers said in an affidavit they found a rifle and a handgun in the suspect's home Winchester, Virginia, home during a search last week. When police came to Carillo's door, he reportedly asked if their visit was ""about the online stuff"" and didn't deny posting the messages.

The 2024 presidential election is shaping up to be highly contentious. Republican candidate Donald Trump has recently escalated his attempts to draw attention to Harris being a woman of color.

He's also planted the seed that, if he loses in November, it will be because the election was somehow rigged. He made that same false assertion after being defeated handily by President Joe Biden in 2020.

Days before the Republican National Committee made Trump its presidential candidate for third straight time last month, a Pennsylvania gunman fired several shots at the 78-year-old Queens native at a rally, wounding the nominee's ear.

It remains unclear why the shooter, a 20-year-old registered Republican, attempted to assassinate the party's representative to lead the country.

Harris put out a statement condemning the ""abhorrent act"" that nearly killed her opponent."
2024-08-05,0.1765,"A smaller media outlet is proposing to be the middle man with a debate between the two candidates.

Plans for an upcoming presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have hit a roadblock ahead of the 2024 presidential election.

Each candidate is currently ready to debate at rival events, with a media company proposing a solution to get both candidates together.

What Happened: The first 2024 presidential debate between Trump and President Joe Biden may have been one of the biggest turning points in the 2024 election, with Biden later dropping out of the race.

The debate was watched by 47.9 million people and set records for Warner Bros. Discovery WBD unit CNN, while also bringing in less viewers than the first presidential debates of 2016 and 2020.

Biden and Trump originally agreed on a second debate set for Sept. 10 on ABC News, a unit of The Walt Disney Company DIS. Fox Corporation FOXFOXA has also proposed hosting a debate on Sept. 17.

NewsNation, which is a unit of Nexstar Media Group NXST, has proposed a debate for Trump and Harris with letters sent to the two presidential candidates' teams.

""I'd like to offer an alternative that would satisfy both candidates - not to mention the American people - a fair, respectful and even-handed debate on NewsNation, co-sponsored by The Hill,"" Nexstar executive Sean Compton said in the letter, as reported by Variety.

Nexstar also owns The Hill, a political news media outlet.

""We of course are flexible on the timing, format and location of the debate, although we certainly expect it would be held in a battleground state such as Pennsylvania.""

NewsNation, launched in 2001, is smaller than other media outlets that have hosted presidential debates. The outlet has attempted to be non-partisan and an alternative to media outlets that are often partisan.

""Unlike some media outlets, they are not identified as favoring either Democrats or Republicans. That's why NewsNation and The Hill are the perfect platform for an intelligent conversation about the crucial issues facing America as we head into the election.""

Harris has said she will be appearing at the previously agreed upon Sept. 10 debate with ABC News. Trump is proposing a Fox News hosted debate on Sept. 4, calling the Sept. 10 debate cancelled since Biden dropped out and due to his ongoing litigation against the media network.

Why It's Important: With Biden and Harris at a standstill over when, where and with which media platform a debate will be hosted, this could be a good opportunity for NewsNation to play the non-partisan card.

Trump has argued that an ABC-hosted debate would not be impartial due to his ongoing litigation with the media network. The former president is also pushing to make sure there is a live studio audience for a debate with Harris, something that was not part of his first debate with Biden.

Harris has pushed back against Trump's claim that he is willing to debate ""any time, any place"" in her recent comments about the presidential debates.

""Donald, I do hope you'll reconsider meeting me on the debate stage,"" Harris recently said. ""If you've got something to say, say it to my face.""

NewsNation hosted the fourth Republican debate during the 2024 election, which was skipped by Trump. The debate had around 4.1 million viewers for NewsNation.

Unlike past debates that were not exclusive to one media network, media companies are now fighting to land the rights to be the home of debates.

CNN was the lucky winner of the rights to the first debate, but also allowed simulcasting of the event, which benefitted Fox, who had strong viewership.

With the 2024 election nearly three months away, voters may be excited about the notion of Trump and Harris facing off head-to-head in a debate for the first time.

With or without the debate, Nexstar is viewed as a potential winner among media stocks with increased spending during the 2024 election as the owner of America's largest local broadcasting network with 200 owned or partner stations in 116 U.S. markets.

2024-08-05,-0.451,"Google acknowledged to House investigators that information pertaining to former President Donald Trump's attempted assassination was inadvertently blocked from appearing in autocomplete search results because its system was ""out of date,"" according to a letter unveiled Monday.

The House Oversight Committee Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government revealed the findings in a letter to Sundar Pichai, the Chief Executive Officer of Alphabet, and alleged that the tech giant may be ""interfering"" in the upcoming election by censoring information pertaining to the assassination attempt. Google's counsel acknowledged an ""error"" to the committee that showed results for Harris instead of Trump and omitted information about Trump entirely in response to the search ""President Donald,"" claiming it was due to a ""bug.""

Google users began flagging the search result discrepancies in late July when the autocomplete feature for ""assassination attempt"" omitted any information regarding the recent Trump shooting. Users also began noticing that Harris related content was the top search result for Trump related searches, leading some to speculate that the tech platform was intentionally censoring information about Trump.

""Recent reporting has indicated that Google may now be interfering in the 2024 presidential election by censoring information about former President Donald Trump's ongoing campaign for the presidency, including relating to the July 13 assassination attempt on him in Pennsylvania,"" the letter reads.

Alphabet, a parent company of Google, also admitted to the committee that autocomplete search results had not shown results related to President Trump in response to searches for ""President Donald,"" because of a ""bug"" in their software that has since been fixed by a recent update, the letter says. The committee said this was a ""vague excuse"" that left ""many questions unanswered.""

The committee also questioned Pichai about why Google searches for Trump had produced search results and news stories relating to Vice President Kamala Harris. Alphabet had claimed that this ""error"" was the ""result of its algorithm"" that is programmed to automatically generate news topics ""related to a Google Search inquiry,"" according to the letter.

""The company also noted that 'predictions may be unexpected or imperfect, and bugs will occur,'"" the report reads.

Since news of the apparent discrepancy first broke, various Republican lawmakers, including Sen. Roger Marshall, criticized Google for its alleged ""censorship against conservative voices,"" calling for an investigation into the platform.

Secretaries of state urge Elon Musk to fix AI chatbot spreading election misinformation on X

Five secretaries of state are urging Elon Musk to fix an AI chatbot on the social media platform X, saying in a letter sent Monday that it has spread election misinformation.

The top election officials from Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Washington told Musk that X's AI chatbot, Grok, produced false information about state ballot deadlines shortly after President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race.

While Grok is only available to subscribers to the premium versions of X, the misinformation was shared across multiple social media platforms and reached millions of people, according to the letter. The bogus ballot deadline information from the chatbot also referenced Alabama, Indiana, Ohio and Texas, although their secretaries of state did not sign the letter. Grok continued to repeat the false information for 10 days before it was corrected, the secretaries said.

The letter urged X to immediately fix the chatbot ""to ensure voters have accurate information in this critical election year."" That would include directing Grok to send users to CanIVote.org, a voting information website run by the National Association of Secretaries of State, when asked about U.S. elections.

Who heads up Project 2025?

A chief architect of Project 2025 -- the controversial conservative blueprint to remake the federal government -- Russell Vought is likely to be appointed to a high-ranking post in a second Donald Trump administration. And he's been drafting a so-far secret ""180-Day Transition Playbook"" to speed the plan's implementation to avoid a repeat of the chaotic start that dogged Trump's first term.

Among the small cadre of Trump advisers who has a mechanic's understanding of how Washington operates, Vought has advised influential conservative lawmakers on Capitol Hill, held a top post in the Trump White House and later established his own pro-Trump think tank. Now, he's being mentioned as a candidate to be Trump's White House chief of staff, one of the most powerful positions in government.

Led by the Heritage Foundation, Project 2025 is a detailed 920-page handbook for governing under the next Republican administration. A whirlwind of hard-right ambitions, its proposals range from ousting thousands of civil servants and replacing them with Trump loyalists to reversing the Food and Drug Administration's approval of medications used in abortions.

Trump revives false claim about Canadian PM Justin Trudeau's parentage

In a conversation with streamer and influencer Adin Ross, former President Trump brought up an old, false theory that former Cuban President Fidel Castro is the father of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

""They say he's the son of Fidel Castro and could be. Anything is possible in this world,"" he said, before saying that Trudeau has become more progressive and that a conservative candidate would be able to defeat him.

The Canadian government has denied this story in the past. Trudeau's parents never visited Cuba until several years after Trudeau was born.

The comment may come across as an insult of a critical national ally. Relations between the U.S. and Canada faced moments of tension during the Trump administration after the former president suggested new tariffs against Canada and he and top aides assailed Trudeau as a ""weak"" and ""dishonest.""

Harris postponing Georgia trip as Tropical Storm Debby moves across the region

Vice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.

Harris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.

Harris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been pulled down, for now.

Debby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to South Carolina and Georgia as it heads east.

Harris' nomination to become official after online balloting ends Monday night

Vice President Kamala Harris' nomination will become official after a five-day round of online balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates ends Monday night and the party announces the results. The party had long contemplated the early virtual roll call to ensure President Joe Biden would appear on the ballot in every state.

An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted after Biden withdrew found 46% of Americans have a favorable view of Harris, while a nearly identical share has an unfavorable view of her.

But more Democrats say they're satisfied with her candidacy compared with that of Biden, energizing a party that had long been resigned to the 81-year-old Biden being its nominee against former President Donald Trump, a Republican they view as an existential threat.

Usha Vance defense husbands 'childless cat ladies' comment

Usha Vance says her husband's ""childless cat ladies comment"" was ""a quip made in service"" of a bigger point the GOP vice presidential contender was trying to make about American political society, not a slight intended at U.S. citizens without children.

Sen. JD Vance's wife made the comment Monday during an interview that aired on Fox News Channel's ""Fox and Friends.""

Usha Vance also noted that she helped her husband with his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, while she wrote hers without his assistance.

Asked about her husband on a personal level, Usha Vance also noted that he ""has a lot of really dorky interests"" without going into specifics.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in court to fight lawsuit saying he falsely claimed to live in NY

Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. arrived at a New York court Monday to fight a lawsuit alleging he falsely claimed to live in New York as he sought to get on the ballot in the state.

Kennedy appeared and sat at his attorneys' table during legal arguments Monday morning, ahead of a civil trial expected to start later in the day in the state capital of Albany. Under state election law, a judge is set to decide the case without a jury.

The lawsuit alleges Kennedy's nominating petition falsely said his residence was in New York's northern suburbs while he actually has lived in Los Angeles since 2014, when he married ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" actor Cheryl Hines.

The suit seeks to invalidate his petition. The case was brought by Clear Choice PAC, a super PAC led by supporters of Democratic President Joe Biden.

Gov. Josh Shapiro on status of Harris running mate selection: 'I got nothing for you, man'

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro didn't say anything about the status of the vice presidential candidate selection Monday morning as he arrived at the state Capitol in Harrisburg.

""I got nothing for you, man,"" the first-term Democrat said and told an Associated Press reporter ""have a great day"" as he headed into the governor's offices, flanked by an aide and several state troopers.

The officers and press secretary Manuel Bonder were waiting for Shapiro when he arrived just after 11 a.m. in a black SUV.

Trump blames Harris and Biden for drop in markets

Former President Donald Trump is blaming Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden for the tumbling of markets in Wall Street and around the world.

Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, made a series of posts on his network Truth Social, attacking his opponent Harris.

""Kamala is even worse than Crooked Joe. Markets will NEVER accept the Radical Left Lunatic that DESTROYED San Francisco and California, as a whole,"" he wrote, and is labeling the plunging market the ""Kamala Crash.""

In another post, Trump called it a ""preview of the world markets without Donald J. Trump in the White House.""

The S&P 500 was down 3.1% in early trading with rising fears about a slowing U.S. economy. Japan's Nikkei 225 helped start Monday by plunging 12.4% for its worst day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.

JD Vance: Harris' running mate pick doesn't matter to him

Donald Trump's running mate, JD Vance, told Fox News on Sunday that Harris' pick doesn't matter to him.

""Whoever she chooses, the problem is going to be Kamala Harris' record and Kamala Harris' policies,"" he said, adding ""it's not going to be good for the country.""

Harris will begin a tour of 7 battleground states

Harris and her running mate -- whoever that is -- will launch into an aggressive, seven-state battleground tour that begins in Philadelphia on Tuesday and winds through Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada.

Her early rallies have attracted enthusiastic thousands. Campaign officials say each stop will be loaded with local election officials, religious leaders, union members and more in an effort to show the diversity of her coalition.

Campaign officials are aware that momentum can be fleeting and are working to capitalize on the energy now, while managing expectations by continuing to emphasize that the race with Republican nominee Donald Trump is tight.

VP's campaign launches 'Republicans for Harris'

Over the weekend, Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign launched ""Republicans for Harris"" as she looks to win over Republican voters put off by Donald Trump's candidacy.

The program will be a ""campaign within a campaign,"" according to Harris' team, using well-known Republicans to activate their networks, with a particular emphasis on primary voters who backed former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.

Hospitality workers' union endorses Harris

The hospitality workers' union UNITE HERE endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president, a rejoinder to Republican Donald Trump's effort to woo restaurant and hotel workers by promising to make their tips tax-free.

The endorsement includes a commitment by the union to have its members knock on more than 3.3 million doors for Harris in swing states."
2024-08-05,-0.3882,"Google acknowledged to House investigators that information pertaining to former President Donald Trump's attempted assassination was inadvertently blocked from appearing in autocomplete search results because its system was ""out of date,"" according to a letter unveiled Monday.

The House Oversight Committee Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government revealed the findings in a letter to Sundar Pichai, the Chief Executive Officer of Alphabet, and alleged that the tech giant may be ""interfering"" in the upcoming election by censoring information pertaining to the assassination attempt. Google's counsel acknowledged an ""error"" to the committee that showed results for Harris instead of Trump and omitted information about Trump entirely in response to the search ""President Donald,"" claiming it was due to a ""bug.""

Google users began flagging the search result discrepancies in late July when the autocomplete feature for ""assassination attempt"" omitted any information regarding the recent Trump shooting. Users also began noticing that Harris related content was the top search result for Trump related searches, leading some to speculate that the tech platform was intentionally censoring information about Trump.

""Recent reporting has indicated that Google may now be interfering in the 2024 presidential election by censoring information about former President Donald Trump's ongoing campaign for the presidency, including relating to the July 13 assassination attempt on him in Pennsylvania,"" the letter reads.

Alphabet, a parent company of Google, also admitted to the committee that autocomplete search results had not shown results related to President Trump in response to searches for ""President Donald,"" because of a ""bug"" in their software that has since been fixed by a recent update, the letter says. The committee said this was a ""vague excuse"" that left ""many questions unanswered.""

The committee also questioned Pichai about why Google searches for Trump had produced search results and news stories relating to Vice President Kamala Harris. Alphabet had claimed that this ""error"" was the ""result of its algorithm"" that is programmed to automatically generate news topics ""related to a Google Search inquiry,"" according to the letter.

""The company also noted that 'predictions may be unexpected or imperfect, and bugs will occur,'"" the report reads.

Since news of the apparent discrepancy first broke, various Republican lawmakers, including Sen. Roger Marshall, criticized Google for its alleged ""censorship against conservative voices,"" calling for an investigation into the platform.

""Google's failure to provide suggestions related to the assassination attempt against President Trump on July 13, 2024 as part of its search function is yet another example of censorship against conservative voices and violates the intent of Section 230,"" Marshall said in the letter. ""Omitting suggestions to the most obvious and recent victim of an assassination attempt shows a willful discrimination against President Trump and users of your search engine.""

Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation."
2024-08-05,0.0588,"Rumors have circulated that Joe Rogan is preparing to file a $30 million lawsuit against MSNBC.

The network allegedly deceptively edited Rogan's comments on a recent podcast episode with Michael Malice to make him appear supportive of Kamala Harris.

""She is a strong woman. She is a person who served overseas, twice,"" Rogan said in the alleged video's mashup of clips.

""She was a congresswoman for eight years,"" Rogan said.

""She is a person of color. She's everything you want,"" he added.

The misleading text in the alleged video from the outlet's TikTok account read, ""Joe Rogan predicts Harris will win the presidency.""

According to Evie Magazine, the alleged video has been deleted.

""What a bizarre mashup from the official MSNBC TikTok account. I think Joe Rogan was talking about Tulsi Gabbard?"" Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter Drake Bentley questioned.

WATCH:

""Unbelievable. MSNBC deceptively edited this clip to make it look like Joe Rogan is fawning over Kamala Harris,"" The Vigilant Fox wrote.

""What MSNBC didn't tell you is that Joe Rogan was really talking about Tulsi Gabbard. Yes, it's true that Joe Rogan thinks Kamala can win. But he was asking why the Democratic party is so h***bent on pushing candidates like Kamala Harris when people like Tulsi Gabbard exist. MSNBC has now reportedly deleted this video from their TikTok page. Receipts on Joe Rogan's remarks in the comment below,"" the post added.

The Vigilant Fox shared Rogan's remarks in a separate clip:

Joe Rogan asks why the Democratic party is so h***bent on pushing candidates like Kamala Harris when people like Tulsi Gabbard exist.

JOE ROGAN: ""Well, it just shows you that what they're looking for is not what they say they're looking for.""

MICHAEL MALICE: ""Yes.""

JOE ROGAN: ""Because she [Tulsi] is a strong woman. She is a person who served overseas twice in a medical unit. So she got to see people blown up by the war. She was a congresswoman for eight years.""

MICHAEL MALICE: ""Yeah.""

JOE ROGAN: ""She is a person of color. She's everything you want, all those things you want, and you don't want her...""

MICHAEL MALICE: ""Because she's not for war.""

JOE ROGAN: ""Yes, well, she's also just not willing to play ball. There's a game that's being played, and if you're like, hey, you're not supposed to f -- king move the ball. Like, oh, look at this b**** over here. Like, get out of here. You're gonna f -- k up our game. It's not real democracy. It's controlled parties.""

As 100 Percent Fed Up noted, Rogan did comment that Kamala Harris can win the 2024 presidential election.

In a recent episode of his podcast, Joe Rogan predicted a Kamala Harris victory in the 2024 presidential election.

""She's gonna win,"" Rogan told Michael Malice on The Joe Rogan Experience this week.

""She can win,"" he added.

""She absolutely can win. I don't think she's going to win,"" Malice responded.

Rogan elaborated, saying people are ""giving into the bull s*** in a way that I never suspected people would before.""

""They just want no Trump no matter what and they're willing to gaslight themselves,"" he continued.

The podcast host also said he thought Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama could win.

""I thought that Trump getting shot would like, that's it, the election is over. But it's like, they memory-holed that so quick,"" he added.

However, it was soon revealed that Rogan's comments were taken out of context. In reality, Rogan was talking about former U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard.

MSNBC then re-uploaded a video of Rogan and cut out the part where he's describing Gabbard. They admit in their new caption that the previous version was misleading. ""Correction: We have removed an earlier version of this post that incorrectly implied Joe Rogan was talking more about Vice President Kamala Harris,"" they wrote. ""He was referring to Tulsi Gabbard.""

MSNBC's fake news fueled outrage over the manipulation of Rogan's comments. The controversy also caught the attention of the former Democratic presidential candidate herself. Taking to X, Gabbard uploaded a video slamming the outlet.

""MSNBC is again EXPOSED as a propaganda machine for the Democrat Elite, and how they will brazenly try to deceive the American people. One part of the video @joerogan was talking about Kamala; on another part of the video, he was talking about me. MSNBC combined it together to make it look like everything said was about Kamala and that he was endorsing her. Of course this is completely false. Furthermore, it's another violation of the FEC law by failing to report their propaganda as a contribution to Kamala's campaign,"" Tulsi Gabbard wrote.

A 66-year-old Virginia man is charged with threatening to burn Vice President Kamala Harris alive to see her suffer.

A prosecutor for the Western District of Virginia said Frank Lucio Carillo was in court Monday for a preliminary hearing over death threats he made against the vice president, who's also the Democratic Party's nominee for president in November.

Using the name ""joemadarats1"" on his Getter social media account, Carillo mentioned Harris nearly 20 times, prosecutors said. Some of those postings were menacing in nature including one claiming the 59-year-old politician would regret running for the presidency after he plucked ""out her eyes with a pair of pliers.""

Carillo is also accused of threatening to shoot anyone who tried to protect Harris in that July 27 post.

Another comment on the suspect's Getter account calls for someone to incinerate the Democratic candidate.

""Kamala Harris needs to be put on fire alive,"" he wrote the same day, according to a Friday court filing. ""I will do it personally if no one else does it. I want her to suffer a slow agonizing death.""

Also last week, Carillo allegedly wrote to Harris ""Just for being a Democrat you're going to die.""

Law enforcement officers said in an affidavit they found a rifle and a handgun in the suspect's Winchester, Va., home during a search last week. When police came to Carillo's door, he reportedly asked if their visit was ""about the online stuff"" and didn't deny posting the messages.

The 2024 presidential election is shaping up to be highly contentious. Republican candidate Donald Trump has recently escalated his attempts to draw attention to Harris being a woman of color.

He's also planted the seed that, if he loses in November, it will be because the election was somehow rigged. He made that same false assertion after being defeated handily by President Biden in 2020.

Days before the Republican National Committee made Trump its presidential candidate for a third straight time last month, a Pennsylvania gunman fired several shots at the 78-year-old Queens native at a rally, wounding the nominee's ear.

It remains unclear why the shooter, a 20-year-old registered Republican, attempted to assassinate the party's representative to lead the country."

HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby is slamming Florida with catastrophic flooding and could bring potentially record-setting rain to Georgia and South Carolina. The storm made landfall on the gulf coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 65 mph. More than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia. At least four storm-related deaths have been reported.

Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.

Rally dates are set. Venues are chosen. The only thing missing for Harris' blitz is her VP choice

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.

Kamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.

Supreme Court shuts down Missouri's long shot push to lift Trump's gag order in hush-money case

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court has shut down a long-shot push from Missouri seeking to remove a gag order in former President Donald Trump's hush-money case and delay his sentencing in New York. The decision comes Monday after the Missouri attorney general had argued in the unusual request that the New York gag order wrongly limits what the GOP presidential nominee could say on the campaign trail and Trump's eventual sentence could affect his ability to travel. New York countered that the limited gag order does allow Trump to talk about the issues important to voters, and the sentence may not affect his movement at all.

Google loses massive antitrust case over its search dominance

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. After reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Hundreds of Israelis have sent orange balloons into the air to mark the fifth birthday of one of two children held captive by militants in the Gaza Strip. Ariel Bibas, who along with his 1-year-old brother Kfir, has become a symbol of the struggle to release the hostages. The orange balloons are meant to symbolize Ariel and Kfir's bright red hair. During its Oct. 7 attack, Hamas killed 1,200 people and took some 250 people hostage, according to Israeli authorities. Among the 110 still held hostage, the Bibas boys are said to be the only children.

WASILLA, Alaska (AP) -- In rural Alaska, the federally funded Head Start preschool program has helped parents earn college degrees. It has put parents with drug addictions on paths toward recovery and educated children who have ended up in foster care. And, of course, it has readied youngsters for kindergarten. So it was crushing when one of Alaska's Head Start providers closed two of its preschools. The program suffers nationally from a teacher shortage -- its teachers must have college degrees, and they can often earn more working in retail or at local school districts. The preschool closures in Alaska preview what other regions across the country could soon face.

At the Paris Olympics, it will no longer be personal for Ukraine's athletes. This time, it's war

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- For Ukrainian athletes, the Paris Olympics are more than just sports. They're a way to draw attention to their country's fight for survival against Russia -- a sort of war on another battlefield. But an Associated Press analysis found Russia's war is making it increasingly difficult for Ukraine, once a post-Soviet sports power, to get those headline-capturing medals. Ukrainian performances began dipping after 2014, the year of Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea. Ukraine's haul of 11 medals at the 2016 Rio Games was its smallest as an independent nation and it tumbled to a low of 22nd in the country rankings. Ukraine recovered to 16th at the pandemic-delayed Olympics in Tokyo in 2021 but just one of its 19 medals was gold -- another new low."

Jordan called it a ""vague excuse"" and told Google to prepared to answer more specific questions, including ""How can the American people be confident that a similar issue, whether intentional or not, will not occur again?""

WATCH MICHAEL KNOWLES' INTERVIEW WITH 'GOOGLE'S WORST NIGHTMARE'

The commitee's letter to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said that Google had finally corrected the issue, where searching for information about attempted assassinations would return results about attempts on other presidents, but not Trump's.

The company faulted ""built-in protections around political violence"" that were ""out of date."" Regardless of the cause, search results were impacted from the July 13th shooting through at least July 29. Google told The Daily Wire at the time that, while the bug suppressed auto-complete, users could still access information about the assassination attempt by searching manually.

But even manual searches for Trump frequently ""returned news labels and stories about Vice President Harris,"" Jordan wrote.

""Alphabet claimed that this error was the result of its algorithm that automatically generates and displays labels about news topics related to a Google Search inquiry,"" Jordan wrote, noting that the company claimed search results ""may be unexpected or imperfect, and bugs will occur.""

Jordan suggested that the errors tended to favor one political party, asking ""Does the company seek to elevate liberal news outlets more prominently over conservative outlets in order to favor Democratic candidates? If not, what steps does the company take to audit how the algorithm is functioning?""

Jordan said Google has an ongoing obligation to produce to Congress documents pursuant to a February 2023 subpoena, even if the documents were created after the subpoena was received.

The Judiciary Committee has investigated political bias among big tech companies and digital advertisers, saying that an advertising association known as the Global Alliance for Responsible Media might have violated anti-trust laws by discouraging companies from advertising with conservative media sources and purporting to speak with one voice on behalf of advertisers in order to leverage changes in tech platforms that helped Democrats."
2024-08-05,-0.4039,"A 66-year-old Virginia man is charged with threatening to burn Vice President Kamala Harris alive to see her suffer.

A prosecutor for the Western District of Virginia said Frank Lucio Carillo was in court Monday for a preliminary hearing over death threats he made against the vice president, who's also the Democratic party's nominee for president in November.

Using the name ""joemadarats1"" on his GETTER social media account, Carillo mentioned Harris nearly 20 times, prosecutors said. Some of those postings were menacing in nature including one claiming the 59-year-old politician would regret running for the presidency after he plucked ""out her eyes with a pair of pliers.""

Carillo is also accused of threatening to shoot anyone who tried to protect Harris in that July 27 post.

Another comment on the suspect's GETTER account calls for someone to incinerate the Democratic candidate.

""Kamala Harris needs to be put on fire alive,"" he wrote the same day, according to a Friday court filing. ""I will do it personally if no one else does it. I want her to suffer a slow agonizing death.""

Also last week, Carillo allegedly wrote to Harris ""Just for being a Democrat you're going to die.""

Law enforcement officers said in an affidavit they found a rifle and a handgun in the suspect's home Winchester, Virginia, home during a search last week. When police came to Carillo's door, he reportedly asked if their visit was ""about the online stuff"" and didn't deny posting the messages.

The 2024 presidential election is shaping up to be highly contentious. Republican candidate Donald Trump has recently escalated his attempts to draw attention to Harris being a woman of color.

He's also planted the seed that, if he loses in November, it will be because the election was somehow rigged. He made that same false assertion after being defeated handily by President Joe Biden in 2020.

Days before the Republican National Committee made Trump its presidential candidate for third straight time last month, a Pennsylvania gunman fired several shots at the 78-year-old Queens native at a rally, wounding the nominee's ear.

It remains unclear why the shooter, a 20-year-old registered Republican, attempted to assassinate the party's representative to lead the country.

Harris put out a statement condemning the ""abhorrent act"" that nearly killed her opponent."

Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.

Dow drops 1,000, and Japanese stocks suffer worst crash since 1987 as markets quake around the world

NEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly everything on Wall Street is tumbling as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsens and sets off another sell-off for financial markets around the world. The S&P 500 sank 3.1% in late trading Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1,009 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.8%. That followed a 12.4% plunge for Japan's Nikkei 225, its worst day since 1987. Treasury yields pared their losses after a report showed U.S. services businesses are continuing to grow. But worries are still high after a report on Friday showed U.S. employers pulled back on hiring last month by more than expected.

Rally dates are set. Venues are chosen. The only thing missing for Harris' blitz is her VP choice

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.

Kamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.

Supreme Court shuts down Missouri's long shot push to lift Trump's gag order in hush-money case

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court has shut down a long-shot push from Missouri seeking to remove a gag order in former President Donald Trump's hush-money case and delay his sentencing in New York. The decision comes Monday after the Missouri attorney general had argued in the unusual request that the New York gag order wrongly limits what the GOP presidential nominee could say on the campaign trail and Trump's eventual sentence could affect his ability to travel. New York countered that the limited gag order does allow Trump to talk about the issues important to voters, and the sentence may not affect his movement at all.

Google loses massive antitrust case over its search dominance

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. After reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Hundreds in Israel mark the 5th birthday of a child held hostage in Gaza

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Hundreds of Israelis have sent orange balloons into the air to mark the fifth birthday of one of two children held captive by militants in the Gaza Strip. Ariel Bibas, who along with his 1-year-old brother Kfir, has become a symbol of the struggle to release the hostages. The orange balloons are meant to symbolize Ariel and Kfir's bright red hair. During its Oct. 7 attack, Hamas killed 1,200 people and took some 250 people hostage, according to Israeli authorities. Among the 110 still held hostage, the Bibas boys are said to be the only children.

This preschool in Alaska changed lives for parents and kids alike. Why did it have to close?

WASILLA, Alaska (AP) -- In rural Alaska, the federally funded Head Start preschool program has helped parents earn college degrees. It has put parents with drug addictions on paths toward recovery and educated children who have ended up in foster care. And, of course, it has readied youngsters for kindergarten. So it was crushing when one of Alaska's Head Start providers closed two of its preschools. The program suffers nationally from a teacher shortage -- its teachers must have college degrees, and they can often earn more working in retail or at local school districts. The preschool closures in Alaska preview what other regions across the country could soon face.

At the Paris Olympics, it will no longer be personal for Ukraine's athletes. This time, it's war

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- For Ukrainian athletes, the Paris Olympics are more than just sports. They're a way to draw attention to their country's fight for survival against Russia -- a sort of war on another battlefield. But an Associated Press analysis found Russia's war is making it increasingly difficult for Ukraine, once a post-Soviet sports power, to get those headline-capturing medals. Ukrainian performances began dipping after 2014, the year of Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea. Ukraine's haul of 11 medals at the 2016 Rio Games was its smallest as an independent nation and it tumbled to a low of 22nd in the country rankings. Ukraine recovered to 16th at the pandemic-delayed Olympics in Tokyo in 2021 but just one of its 19 medals was gold -- another new low."
2024-08-05,-0.051,"A University of Massachusetts Amherst poll, conducted between July 29 and August 1, showed a 7-point swing in the presidential race since the last time the poll was conducted in January.

The poll went from a 4-point lead for former President Donald Trump over President Joe Biden to a 3-point lead for Vice President Kamala Harris over Trump.

The poll found that 43% of respondents planned to vote or were inclined to vote for Trump, the same percentage who answered the question that way in January.

However, while 39% of respondents said in January that they planned to vote for Biden, or were inclined to vote for him, the recent poll showed that 46% planned or were inclined to vote for Harris.

Candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. received 6 percent of the vote in the latest poll, down from 9 percent in January.

The poll, conducted in partnership with WCVB-TV, involved interviews with a sample of 1,000 people nationwide and has a margin of error of 3.8 percent.

The presidential race was disrupted last month by two major events: an assassination attempt on Trump and Biden's withdrawal from the race after extreme pressure from his party.

Harris was able to quickly win support from party leaders, members of Congress and delegates to the Democratic National Convention, who will vote this month to confirm the nomination.

The UMass poll is the latest sign that Harris has shifted the race in Democrats' favor since becoming the likely nominee.

Harris' arrival has really shaken up the presidential race, Jesse Rhodes, a UMass Amherst political science professor and co-director of the poll, said in a press release. Whereas Donald Trump was once a clear favorite over Joe Biden, we now see Harris with a slight lead. This appears to be due to big shifts among young voters, African Americans and Latinos in favor of Harris. Moderates also appear to have shifted dramatically in favor of Harris. The 2024 presidential election is still extremely close, but it's an entirely different race than it was a month ago.

Of those who said they would vote for Harris, 66% cited as their main reason that she represents a new generation. The next most common response, at 37%, was that she would strengthen America's global standing.

Among those who chose Trump, 75% cited his accomplishments in his first term as the main reason they would vote for him, followed by ""He will save America"" at 48%.

The poll also looked at voter enthusiasm since Harris joined the race. Among Democratic respondents, 66% said they were much more enthusiastic or somewhat more enthusiastic since Harris replaced Biden at the top of the ticket.

Among Republicans, 37% said they were either much more enthusiastic or somewhat more enthusiastic.

Kamala Harris improved her standing in Biden's primary race across virtually every demographic subset, including a 17% gain among independents and a notable 14 percentage point increase among young voters, Alexander Theodoridis, co-director of the poll and an associate professor of political science at UMass, said in a statement. The three months until Election Day may feel like an eternity in political time, and the final weeks should remind us how quickly fortunes can turn, but Harris and the Democrats are at a major turning point.

Respondents largely agree on one point regarding the importance of the election. Of all respondents, 89% rated the results of the 2024 election as very important or extremely important.

2024-08-05,0.302,"Thanks to Harris' presidential campaign Zoom has come into its own as an indispensable political tool.

In the days after President Joe Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor, Black women and white men, cat ladies and content creators, LGBTQ folk and Latinos, turned to Zoom to connect, coordinate, and donate, raising more than $300 million for Harris' campaign, injecting new hope into the 2024 presidential election.

""It was phenomenal. It was inspiring. It was galvanizing,"" said TaRessa Stovall, a Mount Laurel writer and one of the 44,000 people on the historic Win With Black Women call, kicking off the virtual fundraising trend Harris' possible ascension to the presidency ignited. ""It was like church, a full tent revival, and pep rally all at once. There was an immediate sense of community.""

Just when we thought we were over Zoom, the meeting app has come into its own as an indispensable political tool. Fascinating, yes. But not far-fetched, as social media and easy-to-use apps continue to shape how we protest, politic, and advocate.

Galvanizing support for candidates is as old as politics itself, said Sergei Kostiaev, assistant professor of political science at Drexel University. Politicians are and always will be searching for effective ways to talk about themselves, the issues, and prove their opponents wrong, he said. ""The nature of politics doesn't change, it's how we mobilize and communicate that changes, Kostiaev added. ""Zoom is the latest tool.""

Thanks to the pandemic, most of us are well-versed with Zoom. We know how to have side convos in the chat and how to turn off the camera for bathroom breaks. Organizing Zooms can take less than a minute and hopping on one, seconds. We have Zoom in the background while washing dishes and tucking in the kids. And it's a lot easier to show up to a virtual event and make a donation than find a babysitter, get gussied up in sparkles and heels, and make said donation. ""People don't have to leave their house and they still feel like they were in the political trenches,"" Kostiaev said. ""It provides access, satisfaction, and convenience.""

Zoom's impact on Harris' race has been astounding. Win With Black Women raised $1.5 million on its first VP Harris for President call. Fifty-three thousand Black men raised $1.3 million on Zoom the following evening. That same week, 160,000 white women met on Zoom and raised $8.5 million and to Fox Network's chagrin, 180,000 White Dudes for Harris, raised $4 million. Cat Ladies for Kamala hosted a Zoom Call To Action Sunday evening, and according to Instagram, raised $320,000 by the end of the call.

Harris secured enough votes Friday from Democratic delegates to officially be named the party's nominee for president and her campaign raised $310 million in July, more than double what the Trump campaign raised. In less than two weeks, political pundits say, Harris has reset the race, up by 1 point in the polls.

Now, we need this Zoom momentum to translate into votes.

"" READ MORE: I'm not interested in your Kamala Harris memes. I just want you to vote.

Those of us tired of Trump and vice-presidential nominee, JD Vance, talking to Black people, Latinos, Asians, Jewish folks -- heck, women who don't have children -- as if we are not American, nor do we deserve to be, are turning to Zoom not just to raise money, but to vent. We are finding two truths: we are not alone and there is strength in numbers.

Jotaka Eaddy, founded Win With Black Women during the 2020 presidential election to support then vice presidential candidate, Harris. Her goal: to ensure when Trump attacked -- and he did -- that Harris had a force field of millions of Black women supporting her. Rep. Joyce Beatty, scheduled to appear on the July 21 evening's night Zoom, mentioned the Zoom on MSNBC and by the end of the night Black women were getting text alerts to come to the meeting -- I got at least five, and was one of the many women who tried but couldn't access the call.

If we wanted to save democracy, we had to get busy.

""The Right has worked really hard to redefine this concept of identity politics as something bad,"" said Sarah J. Jackson, an associate professor in the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication and expert on Black and feminist media and activism. ""The truth is affinity groups are all invested in the same project of saving democracy this election. This is something that's kind of beautiful, something that a functional multiracial democracy should look like.""

Trump will continue to run his ugly divide and conquer plays. He will continue to say untrue things about people of color -- like suggesting there is such a thing as Black jobs -- to unite his racist followers. Last week Trump stooped to a new low, questioning Harris' Blackness at the National Association of Black Journalists Convention in Chicago, never mind Harris attended Howard University, an HBCU, and pledged Alpha Kappa Alpha, the country's oldest Black sorority. Never mind Harris, whose mother is Indian and father is Jamaican, has always identified as a proud, Black woman -- her late 1980s Salt-N-Pepa asymmetrical cut speaks Gen X Black woman volumes.

In addition to creating safe spaces for affinity groups, Zoom is creating a platform for our allies and accomplices to speak, raise money, and speak out in large numbers. During the ""White Woman: Answer the Call! Show up for Kamala Harris"" call, white women admitted to failing when they did not vote for Hillary Clinton, pledging to elect -- and make other White women elect -- the first woman of color as president. Now they know their reproductive rights and those of their children depend on it. White Dudes for Harris double down on the idea that Trump doesn't speak for all white men, proving the must vulnerable of us have more allies than we realized.

That warms my heart more than the millions of dollars raised for Harris' campaign.

Harris sloughed Trump's comments as his same old show of ""divisiveness and disrespect"" in her response to Trump's NABJ tirade."" We deserve a leader who understands that our differences to not divide us -- they are an essential source of our strength,"" Harris said.

MAGA Republicans are counting on a divided America will distract us so much Trump can easily slide into a second presidency. Harris' candidacy is giving us a shot at saving our democracy, one Zoom call at a time."

Radio host Charlamagne tha God is sounding the alarm as well. During an early August appearance on ITK, Charlamagne predicted that if Democratic nominee Kamala Harris defeats Trump in November, the U.S. Supreme Court will overturn the election results.

""Right now, everybody should be focusing on the Supreme Court,"" Charlamagne argued. ""The Supreme Court is no longer a legitimate institution -- the same Supreme Court that Donald Trump put three judges on. I'm glad that (President) Joe Biden is calling for Supreme Court reform now, but it's going to take a lot more than that to stop the corruption that is going on with the Supreme Court.""

READ MORE: 'Politically stupid': GOP leaders warn 'Trump may have just lost Georgia'

Charlamagne continued, ""When you look at the recent rulings of the Supreme Court -- whether it's abolishing Roe v. Wade, whether it's the presidential immunity for presidents to get away with crimes, whether it's the fact that elected officials can take bribes now -- it's like, what happens in November if the vice president wins, and then Donald Trump challenges the results of the election? In light of all of those recent rulings, what makes us think the Supreme Court wouldn't overturn the results of an election?""

Many Trump critics, including ""Real Time"" host Bill Maher, have predicted that Trump will not accept the election results if he loses -- a prediction Maher also made in 2020.

Charlamagne, however, is going a step further in predicting that the U.S. Supreme Court will help Trump steal the election if he loses.

""That's honestly what I see coming,"" the radio host warned. ""I see that happening right now. I think that is going to be the biggest constitutional crisis of our lifetime come November.""

When Charlamagne was asked if, to be clear, he believes the Supreme Court will ""overrule the election results if Vice President Harris does win in November,"" he reiterated, ""I don't see how anybody can't see this coming. I really don't.... Presidents having immunity from criminal prosecution?.... What is going to happen in November when Donald Trump challenges the results of an election?....

WASILLA, Alaska (AP) -- In rural Alaska, the federally funded Head Start preschool program has helped parents earn college degrees. It has put parents with drug addictions on paths toward recovery and educated children who have ended up in foster care. And, of course, it has readied youngsters for kindergarten. So it was crushing when one of Alaska's Head Start providers closed two of its preschools. The program suffers nationally from a teacher shortage -- its teachers must have college degrees, and they can often earn more working in retail or at local school districts. The preschool closures in Alaska preview what other regions across the country could soon face.

At the Paris Olympics, it will no longer be personal for Ukraine's athletes. This time, it's war

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- For Ukrainian athletes, the Paris Olympics are more than just sports. They're a way to draw attention to their country's fight for survival against Russia -- a sort of war on another battlefield. But an Associated Press analysis found Russia's war is making it increasingly difficult for Ukraine, once a post-Soviet sports power, to get those headline-capturing medals. Ukrainian performances began dipping after 2014, the year of Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea. Ukraine's haul of 11 medals at the 2016 Rio Games was its smallest as an independent nation and it tumbled to a low of 22nd in the country rankings. Ukraine recovered to 16th at the pandemic-delayed Olympics in Tokyo in 2021 but just one of its 19 medals was gold -- another new low.

For female athletes of color, scrutiny around gender rules and identity is part of a long trend

PARIS (AP) -- Female athletes of color have historically faced disproportionate scrutiny and discrimination when it comes to sex testing and false accusations that they are male or transgender. Algerian boxer Imane Khelif and Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-Ting are the latest examples of women of color who have found themselves caught in a contentious debate around gender regulations and perceptions in sports. Historians and anthropologists say international sporting federations don't tend to promote an understanding of diversity in sex and gender identity. They note that gender tests have often targeted female athletes of color who don't conform to typically Western, white ideals of femininity."
2024-08-05,-0.3647,"A 66-year-old Virginia man is charged with threatening to burn Vice President Kamala Harris alive to see her suffer.

A prosecutor for the Western District of Virginia said Frank Lucio Carillo was in court Monday for a preliminary hearing over death threats he made against the vice president, who's also the Democratic party's nominee for president in November.

Using the name ""joemadarats1"" on his GETTER social media account, Carillo mentioned Harris nearly 20 times, prosecutors said. Some of those postings were menacing in nature including one claiming the 59-year-old politician would regret running for the presidency after he plucked ""out her eyes with a pair of pliers.""

Carillo is also accused of threatening to shoot anyone who tried to protect Harris in that July 27 post.

Another comment on the suspect's GETTER account calls for someone to incinerate the Democratic candidate.

""Kamala Harris needs to be put on fire alive,"" he wrote the same day, according to a Friday court filing. ""I will do it personally if no one else does it. I want her to suffer a slow agonizing death.""

Also last week, Carillo allegedly wrote to Harris ""Just for being a Democrat you're going to die.""

Law enforcement officers said in an affidavit they found a rifle and a handgun in the suspect's home Winchester, VA., home during a search last week. When police came to Carillo's door, he reportedly asked if their visit was ""about the online stuff"" and didn't deny posting the messages.

The 2024 presidential election is shaping up to be highly contentious. Republican candidate Donald Trump has recently escalated his attempts to draw attention to Harris being a woman of color.

He's also planted the seed that, if he loses in November, it will be because the election was somehow rigged. He made that same false assertion after being defeated handily by President Joe Biden in 2020.

Days before the Republican National Committee made Trump its presidential candidate for third straight time last month, a Pennsylvania gunman fired several shots at the 78-year-old Queens native at a rally, wounding the nominee's ear.

It remains unclear why the shooter, a 20-year-old registered Republican, attempted to assassinate the party's representative to lead the country."
2024-08-05,0.1373,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appeared in a New York court on Monday to fight a residency challenge as he seeks to get on the state's ballot as an independent candidate for the 2024 presidential election.

The Associated Press (AP) reported that Kennedy appeared in a civil court in Albany, New York, to fight against a lawsuit that alleges he falsely claimed New York as his residence. According to state election law, the presiding judge will decide the case without a jury.

The lawsuit contends that Kennedy's nominating petition falsely claimed his residence was in New York City's northern suburbs while he has actually been living in Los Angeles since his 2014 marriage to Curb Your Enthusiasm star Cheryl Hines.

The AP reported that the case against Kennedy was brought by Clear Choice PAC, a group formed earlier this year by allies of President Joe Biden.

During the trial on Monday, a Kennedy friend named David Michaelis took the stand and testified Kennedy was a frequent guest at his home in Westchester County from 2014 to 2017. According to the AP, Michaelis received a document while testifying which showed Kennedy said that Michaelis had asked him to move out of his house in March 2023 over his support for Biden.

However, Michaelis called the statement ""fiction"" and said Kennedy never lived in his home.

In his New York ballot petition, Kennedy lists his residence in the state as a home belonging to a different friend in Katonah, a wealthy suburb in Westchester County. Kennedy claims he moved there after being asked to vacate Michaelis' residence.

However, the lawsuit argues that Kennedy ""has no meaningful or continuous connections to the property"" in Katonah and has spent ""vanishingly little time, if any,"" at the location.

""Moreover, the evidence will show that Kennedy's wife and children live in California, along with his three dogs, two ravens, an emu and his personal belongings,"" the lawsuit says, according to the AP.

In a Monday statement, Kennedy's attorney, William F. Savino of Woods Oviatt Gilman, said: ""The home at 84 Croton Lake Road in Katonah, New York, is Mr. Kennedy's official address.""

""He receives mail there. His driver's license and automobile are registered there. His voting registration, and fishing, and falconry licenses are from New York. His law office is in New York. He pays taxes to New York State,"" Savino said in the statement. ""New York has been his residence continuously since 1964, and Mr. Kennedy has deep ties to it. He even keeps his beloved falcons in New York State. He has never claimed any other state as a residency. He intends to move back to New York as soon as his wife retires from acting.""

Earlier on Monday, Kennedy made headlines after sharing a video on X (formerly Twitter) in which he said that he was behind the dumping of a dead bear cub in New York's Central Park.

The story originally made headlines in 2014 when a woman found the dead cub while walking her dog. On Sunday, Kennedy shed new light on the case, admitting it was he who left the cub there. He gave an account of the events in a video posted to X, ahead of an upcoming article in The New Yorker that he said was going to break the story.

Newsweek was directed to the statement from Savino after reaching out to Kennedy's campaign via email for comment."
2024-08-05,-0.051,"A women's group is calling on Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democrat nominee in the 2024 presidential election, not to pick Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as her running mate due to concerns about how he handled sexual assault claims that emerged in his office.

Harris is expected to reveal her vice presidential pick no later than Tuesday. Shapiro is widely seen as one of the frontrunners to secure a place on the Democrats' presidential ticket.

The National Women's Defense League, which describes itself as ""a nonpartisan organization dedicated to preventing sexual harassment and protecting survivors,"" released a statement on Facebook last week expressing concern about the possibility that Harris might pick Shapiro.

""The American people deserve to know that if called to a higher office, Governor Josh Shapiro will do more to ensure the safety and dignity of employees, volunteers and constituents in his office,"" the NWDL stated. ""As the Harris campaign and the Democratic Party consider their options for vice presidential candidates, we urge them to consider the handling of past complaints of sexual harassment inside the Pennsylvania governor's office.""

The NWDL specifically brought up ""sexual harassment happening in [Shapiro's] own office by Cabinet Secretary Mike Vereb,"" asserting that the office ""should have done a better job preventing"" it from happening in the first place.

Examples of actions it wished Shapiro's office would have taken include ""protecting the survivor who bravely came forward, ensuring that any other potential survivors felt safe in speaking up, and ensuring that the harasser didn't have the opportunity to do further harm after the complaint.""

""Our research indicates that there is rarely only one survivor in cases like this one,"" the group added. ""When it comes to sexual harassment, silence is not golden -- it's a red flag. Often, it indicates that others may not feel safe or supported in coming forward with their truth. NWDL acknowledges potential silent survivors and we stand with those who choose not to share their experiences publicly.""

According to the group, ""[s]exual harassment is especially rampant in our government and political workspaces, and we need leaders who will buck the pernicious status quo.""

""We deserve leaders who will not brush sexual harassment under the rug, but will put accountability above politics. We need leaders who prioritize effective policies, protocols and culture that prevents sexual harassment and protects survivors,"" they added.

The subject of the sexual harassment complaint, Mike Vereb, served as secretary of legislative affairs from the start of the Shapiro administration in early 2023 until late September of that year.

A statement from the governor's office from last September announced that Vereb was resigning and praised the Republican former state representative for ""six years securing funding for law enforcement and enhancing school safety in the Office of Attorney General and the critical first year of our Administration getting a historic, bipartisan budget across the finish line.""

Shapiro's Chief of Staff Dana Fritz described Vereb as ""a key member of our team,"" adding that they ""wish Mike all the best and we're grateful for his service."" The statement did not mention any sexual harassment allegations against Vereb.

A report from Spotlight PA details how an unnamed former staffer filed a complaint in May 2023 alleging that Vereb had made inappropriate, lewd and sexually suggestive comments to her and that the state retaliated against her when she raised questions about his image. Subsequent reporting reveals that the governor's office released a settlement of $295,000 with the survivor that also requires staff to undergo sexual harassment training.

The governor's office has a policy in place requiring that the Equal Opportunity Officer of a particular agency where alleged acts of sexual harassment may have occurred to conduct an investigation after receiving a complaint that includes interviews with the complainant, alleged offender and any witnesses. Implemented in 2012, the policy predates Shapiro's tenure as governor.

Shapiro is seen as an attractive contender for the vice presidential nomination because he is governor of a critical swing state that has 19 electoral votes. The RealClearPolitics average of polls taken of Pennsylvania voters shows Harris trailing former President Donald Trump, her Republican opponent, by 1.8 percentage points.

However, criticism of Shapiro extends beyond concerns about his office's handling of the sexual assault claim. Michael Moore, a progressive filmmaker and activist, has warned that Harris' selection of Shapiro, an observant Jew and a strong supporter of Israel, could cost her support in the swing state of Michigan. In a Substack post published last week, Moore complained that ""Shapiro said it's 'antisemitic' for anyone to join the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel.""

Moore identified Shapiro's position on Israel as well as his comments about college students protesting as behaviors that will ""diminish the Arab American vote for Harris and depress a large swath of the youth vote throughout the country,"" noting that ""Michigan has one of the largest Arab American populations in the nation.""

Michigan has 15 electoral college votes and the RealClearPolitics average of polls taken there shows Harris leading Trump by 2 percentage points."
2024-08-05,0.0588,"Adin Ross is not a name one might expect to come up in a conversation about the 2024 presidential election. Ross, 23, is a Twitch streamer who first became famous for playing NBA 2K online with LeBron James's son before he was banned from the platform after a repeated use of slurs. As he has grown into his fame, the Gen-Z streamer has grown more conservative, hanging out with Andrew Tate and hosting white supremacist Nick Fuentes on his stream.

This is the platform that Donald Trump chose for his first media hit of the week. On the livestreaming service Kick, where Ross has hosted his stream since being removed from Twitch, Trump walked out to 50 Cent's ""Many Men"" as a small audience applauded in a room in Mar-a-Lago where the cameras were set up. ""Do you know what livestreaming is?"" Ross asked Trump.

""More or less,"" Trump answered. ""It's the new wave."" In the hour-plus interview, Trump went through his usual stream-of-consciousness stump speech. Ross, a little over his head, was unable to contribute to the conversation beyond lines like, ""That's really sad to think about"" or ""Damn, that's crazy to think about."" Trump did manage to direct a few lines to the young audience tuning in. ""Youth tends to be Democrat,"" he said, but unlike past elections, the country ""can't wait 50 years"" for this demographic shift. ""Make the move now, all of you young people,"" he said to the 450,000 people tuned in. Ross, feeling generous, gave Trump a Rolex and a Tesla Cybertruck with a full MAGA vinyl wrap. He forced Trump, in his own home, to meet other guys whose job is video games. In the parking lot next to Trump's new ride, they did Trump's weird little hand dance.

It was an interesting choice for Trump to appear on an edgelord gamer's stream at a moment when his campaign desperately needs to shift the momentum in his favor. But Republicans have been dipping into the demo of conservative-leaning podcasts by and for Gen-Z guys for some time now. Last week, vice-presidential candidate J.D. Vance appeared on a podcast with the Nelk Boys, a group of Canadian influencers who rose to fame by doing Jackass-lite pranks and partying all the time; they have since become a must-stop visit for Republican politicians trying to get in front of fratty young voters. (In his hour with hosts Steiny and Kyle Forgeard, Vance talked about getting the call from Trump that he would be his next VP choice while his son wanted to talk to him about Pokémon. ""Shut the hell up for 30 seconds about Pikachu,"" Vance joked, unpleasantly, that he told his son. ""This is the most important phone call of my life. Please, just let me take this phone call."") Trump himself appeared on the Nelk Boys' podcast back in 2022 in an episode that YouTube removed because Trump went on a rant about false election-fraud claims, which is a violation of the company's policy.

Trump has yet to reprise his Nelk Boys appearance, but it looks like more is on the way from the Canadian group whose videos include ""We Corrupted an Amish Person!"" and ""Andrew Tate Stole Our Girl at the Club!"" Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Nelk Boys are involved in a $20 million PAC called Send the Vote. The group will target the ""growing movement of young people across this country rallying behind a pro-freedom, pro-America agenda,"" as its business partner told the Journal. Events include voter-registration drives at sports events and Ultimate Fighting Championship-adjacent parties in which attendees must prove they are registered to vote to get in. For what it's worth, UFC president Dana White appears to be the common thread between Trump and these young conservative men with talk shows. ""Shout-out to Dana,"" Ross said on Monday. ""There's nobody like him,"" Trump added.

It's too early to say if the plan will work to mobilize young male voters who may be moving toward the Republican Party. But at least Donald Trump appears to be having fun so far. This summer, he's gotten to golf on a stream with 30-year-old pro Bryson DeChambeau and talked about the world of combat sports with YouTuber and budding wrestling star Logan Paul. As many people have noted, his video with Paul was one of the only times we've seen Trump earnestly laugh in a long while."

2024-08-06,-0.2,"Investing.com-- Bitcoin price rose on Tuesday, rising in tandem with broader risk-driven assets as they recovered from bruising losses in the prior session, which also saw the world's largest cryptocurrency slide to over five-month lows.

Bitcoin rose 8.2% in the past 24 hours to $55,690.4 by 02:15 ET (06:15 GMT). The token had slumped as low as $49,000 before recovering some ground.

Broader crypto prices also recovered some of Monday's slump, tracking a rebound in equity markets. But sentiment towards risk-driven assets still remained largely fragile.

While the world's biggest cryptocurrency did recover some of its recent losses, a bigger recovery remained doubtful amid persistent concerns over a U.S. recession and an extended rout in equity markets.

Crypto markets were especially vulnerable to the risk-off rout, given their highly speculative nature. Sentiment towards Bitcoin was already strained by reports showing the U.S. government mobilized at least $2 billion of tokens for a potential sale.

Uncertainty over the regulatory outlook for crypto, as the 2024 presidential election drew near, also kept traders skittish towards cryptocurrencies.

Crypto investment products saw outflows of around $528 million in the past week, data from digital assets manager Coinshares showed on Monday.

Bitcoin and Ether accounted for most of the outflows, which appeared to be spurred by a broad decline in sentiment. Short-Bitcoin instruments were among the few products to see inflows, especially after the reports of the government mobilization last week.

Trading volumes in crypto investment products also remained well below yearly averages, with the recent launch of spot Ether exchange-traded funds sparking little optimism.

Broader crypto markets tracked a recovery in Bitcoin, recouping some of their steep losses but still remaining well below levels seen last week.

Crypto prices rose tracking gains in U.S. stock index futures and Asian markets, as equities appeared to be somewhat stabilizing after a bruising rout on Monday.

The prospect of U.S. interest rate cuts also helped sentiment, as markets bet on a bigger reduction in September on worsening economic conditions.

But crypto's recovery still remained relatively fragile, with sector's speculative nature keeping the risk of another potential selldown in play."

2024-08-06,-0.2784,"Imagine my surprise when, nearly eight months ago, commenting on the state of the country as it approached the 2024 presidential election, New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg noted that ""Biden has set himself the task of trying to jolt the country out of its learned helplessness in the face of Trump's exhausting provocations."" Unbeknownst to most Americans, that term, ""learned helplessness,"" was profoundly and inextricably tied to this country's disastrous post-9/11 Global War on Terror and, in particular, its horrifying torture program. Yet there it was, being used in a new context -- one that, while perhaps altered by the president's recent decision not to run for a second term, has been employed with remarkable frequency in the intervening months, especially recently, when it comes to this country's presidential future.

As the pundits weighed in on Joe Biden's abysmal performance at that June 27th debate with Donald Trump and cast doubt on his prospects for reelection, ""learned helplessness"" was used over and over again in the days leading up to his withdrawal from the presidential race in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris. Two days after the debate, for instance, The Economist, focusing on Biden's refusal to declare himself a non-candidate for the presidency, concluded that ""many [Democrats] have fallen into learned helplessness,"" as evidenced by the gap between their private doubts and their public assertions.

Writing for the San Francisco-based progressive daily, 48hills, Bruce Mirkin chastised the Democrats for choosing hopelessness over hope. ""Instead of 'yes, we can,'"" he wrote, ""the instinctive response from a good portion of the folks who should be helping to defend democracy seems to be 'no, we can't.'"" He then labeled the party's inaction ""learned helplessness."" Jordan Zakarin, writing for the Center for American Progress Action's Progress Report, extended that diagnosis from ""the worst debate performance in modern history"" to the larger moment in Washington. He pointed, for instance, to Attorney General Merrick Garland having ""slow-walked prosecuting Donald Trump."" ""It is,"" he concluded, ""a learned helplessness,"" a ""preemptive surrender.""

The question is: What should we make of the concept of ""learned helplessness""? Where did it come from and what are the remedies writ large? In this distinctly disturbing moment in our history, is it possible that an all-American version of despair and hopelessness has changed in light of Joe Biden's backing out of the presidential race?

The Psychological Concept

To better understand the sudden shower of references to ""learned helplessness,"" a little history is in order. In the late 1960s, psychologist Martin Seligman coined the term while conducting experiments with dogs. He had accidentally stumbled on the fact that dogs that experienced electrical shocks without having any control over starting or stopping them were ultimately rendered strangely passive. They proved unwilling to move, even to escape further mistreatment.

After more experiments demonstrated that being subjected to severe pain or stress did indeed induce a state of inaction in dogs, Seligman then turned to humans and discovered that individuals who had suffered an act or acts of trauma and abuse continued, well after the painful incident, to show signs of depression and anxiety that rendered them completely unable to act. They continued to exist, he discovered, in a state of profound resignation and inaction, long after the traumatic moment in which they found themselves powerless. Afterward, they were convinced that nothing was under their control, that any action they might take would be futile, and that failure was inevitable, should they even try to act. (Later studies suggested that some elderly individuals might also experience such a state of profound resignation and inaction in response to ""stressful life events,"" at times in association with dementia.)

But here's the truly strange thing: more than three decades later in the years after the 9/11 attacks, Seligman's concept of ""learned helplessness"" would be quite purposely baked into the interrogation and torture program created and implemented for war on terror detainees by American officials during the administration of President George W. Bush. As the executive summary of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's torture report explained, one of the two psychologists contracted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for the purpose of devising its interrogation program ""had reviewed research on 'learned helplessness,' in which individuals might become passive and depressed in response to adverse or uncontrollable events. He theorized,"" the report added, ""that inducing such a state could encourage a detainee to cooperate and provide information.""

That psychologist, Bruce Mitchell, even met with Seligman while designing techniques to use on war-on-terror detainees suspected of ties to the 9/11 terror group al-Qaeda and its leadership at the secret ""black sites"" the CIA set up globally. (Seligman, it seems, had no idea of the horrors Mitchell and his associates were planning.) Ironically enough, Seligman's findings and his concept of ""learned helplessness"" would indeed become a basic part of the development of the CIA's torture program. (Seligman would come to condemn the use of the concept for interrogations at those black sites. As The Washington Post reported, ""When [Seligman] later learned through media accounts how it was employed -- for enhanced interrogation -- he issued a statement: 'I am grieved and horrified that good science, which has helped so many people overcome depression, may have been used for such bad purposes.'"")

To induce a profound state of helplessness, those post-9/11 captives were sent to the CIA's black sites where they were subjected to ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" designed to elicit information from them. Their torture included beatings, being smashed into walls, being hung by their limbs in excruciatingly painful positions, forced nudity, sodomy, and repeated sleep deprivation, among other things. The CIA also used waterboarding (subjecting detainees to the feeling of drowning), placed them in coffin-like boxes, and threatened to use a gun or a power drill on those who refused to give answers sought by their interrogators. Just last month, in a pre-trial hearing at the forever prison the Bush administration set up offshore -- and away from the federal court system -- at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, in 2002, such techniques were once again described in detail, this time by John Bruce Jessen, the psychologist who, along with Mitchell, designed the nightmarish interrogation program. In addition to his testimony, he also demonstrated the technique of ""walling,"" which involved slamming a detainee's head against a wall.

The goal was simple: to reduce that prisoner to a profound state of complete paralysis and disempowerment in which, having no hope of relief or escape, he would do whatever his captors wanted. Detainees would see that there was no way out but to answer their captors' questions, which, it turned out, often led them, in desperation and a state of learned helplessness, to confess to things they hadn't done, to confess to whatever their captors wanted to hear.

Having studied and written about the nightmare of those prisoners and Guantánamo for so many years now, it's been supremely jarring to see the term ""learned helplessness"" re-emerge in connection to the current unnerving state of American politics and the 2024 presidential election. Yet, in many ways, it seems a strangely appropriate lens through which to view the world of Donald Trump and the rest of us. It was true, as many commented, that a sense of learned helplessness indisputably crept into the mindset of so many of us in this country -- at least prior to Joe Biden's decision not to pursue a second term as president.

The American people have indeed suffered multiple stressful, even traumatic experiences in recent years. The shock of a government that didn't protect them on September 11, 2001; the devastating experience of a president who refused to protect them from Covid, as bodies piled up on the streets of this country; the winnowing away of rights and liberties once protected by the Constitution and the Supreme Court -- from the overturning of Roe v. Wade to a rash of recent decisions, including one that gave a president essential immunity in relation to more or less anything he did, no matter how devastating; the inability of the courts to proceed in their prosecutions of Donald Trump; the nearly paralyzed state of a riven Congress amid an economic reality that has led so many younger Americans to be unable to purchase their own homes or send their children to college -- all have collectively cowed the population. Even before both the Supreme Court's presidential immunity decision and the dismal debate performance of Biden, a sense of learned helplessness seemed well in place, and understandably so.

The Republican Party has also succumbed to a state of learned helplessness. One after another, former opponents of Trump and the MAGA ideology he stands for have succumbed to his agenda and given up on pursuing their own independent goals. Republican vice-presidential nominee J.D. Vance is certainly a case in point. Having formerly called out Trump for his lack of morality, his xenophobia, and his racism, as well as for being a ""total fraud"" and ""America's Hitler,"" he is now on board with the ideas he once said he deplored, including, for example, an untethered anti-immigration stance that calls for massive deportations of illegal immigrants. Similarly, Trump's Republican election opponent Nikki Haley has given up her ""legacy of blunt assessments and brutal takedowns"" of the former president, as The Nation's John Nichols has aptly described her opposition to Trump, whom she once described as ""a dangerous stooge of Russian president Vladimir Putin.""

The question is: What, if anything, does the research tell us about curing such a state?

Is There, in Fact, a Cure?

Psychologists do point to remedies for such a profound state of hopelessness. They suggest several healing paths forward, including therapy to examine the causes of one's despair and to discover constructive paths beyond it; exercise to stimulate the body and the mind; and a commitment to ""learned optimism,"" a pattern of reaction geared to expecting the best rather than the worst out of any situation. As Psychology Today points out, ""Seligman later developed the concept of learned optimism. By explaining events to ourselves in a constructive manner and developing a positive internal dialogue, people can break free from their cycle of helplessness."" Small wins and an energized commitment to positivity are basic tenets of finding a way to ""learned optimism.""

If a turn towards optimism offers a way out of the helplessness of our times, perhaps we are seeing the beginning of just such an event. Recently, Slate's Dahlia Lithwick, again invoking the term ""learned helplessness,"" suggested that reports of the plans of the Biden administration to back Supreme Court reform were a sign of the kind of future ""systemwide cognitive reboot for American voters that seems almost inconceivable in the generalized torpor and despair of July 2024."" The headline of her article read, appropriately enough, ""Are We Finally Letting Go of Our Learned-Helplessness Syndrome Around the Supreme Court?""

So, too, the outpouring of energy and excitement following Biden's decision to bow out of the presidential race and the enthusiasm for newer, younger Democratic Party leadership -- and for Vice President Kamala Harris, in particular -- already seems eons removed from the head-shaking resignation of Democratic voters confronting a ""choice"" between an aging Joe Biden and You Know Who on election day. In fact, in many ways, that new turn of affairs could be just what the doctor ordered, though, of course, a possible November election victory for Donald Trump could still put the phrase ""learned helplessness"" in a grimly new light.

For Democrats, the idea that there could be a brighter future, one in which a sense of control replaced one of powerlessness -- an election in which their presidential candidate has a viable chance of winning -- has taken hold. In place of anxiety and depression, there is optimism, or at least a ""cautious hope."" Declaring her ""immense pride and limitless optimism for our country's future,"" Nancy Pelosi echoed the importance of this newfound optimism when endorsing Kamala Harris as the party's candidate for 2024. As Tim Alberta summed it up in The Atlantic, ""As far back as springtime, the numbers told a straightforward story: Biden was not going to win. Democrats could only look on, powerless."" However, now, he concludes, it is the Republicans who are feeling hope and control fade away: ""Sunday brought an unfamiliar feeling of powerlessness. For the first time in a long time, Trump does not control the narrative of 2024.""

Whether or not such optimism gains momentum in the potentially tumultuous days ahead remains to be seen, as does whether the Republicans can find a way out of their own potential sense of learned helplessness in the face of a changing scenario. Whatever happens, given what I know about the past use of that phrase and the nightmare of the war on terror's use of torture, my own hope is that, with election 2024, the very concept of learned helplessness and the realities it represents, whether it applies to torture at the hands of the U.S. government or suffering at the hands of Trumpian politics, can finally be politically laid to rest.

Call it learned optimism, if you wish, but fingers crossed.

2024-08-06,-0.2784,"Imagine my surprise when, nearly eight months ago, commenting on the state of the country as it approached the 2024 presidential election, New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg noted that ""Biden has set himself the task of trying to jolt the country out of its learned helplessness in the face of Trump's exhausting provocations."" Unbeknownst to most Americans, that term, ""learned helplessness,"" was profoundly and inextricably tied to this country's disastrous post-9/11 Global War on Terror and, in particular, its horrifying torture program. Yet there it was, being used in a new context -- one that, while perhaps altered by the president's recent decision not to run for a second term, has been employed with remarkable frequency in the intervening months, especially recently, when it comes to this country's presidential future.

As the pundits weighed in on Joe Biden's abysmal performance at that June 27th debate with Donald Trump and cast doubt on his prospects for reelection, ""learned helplessness"" was used over and over again in the days leading up to his withdrawal from the presidential race in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris. Two days after the debate, for instance, The Economist, focusing on Biden's refusal to declare himself a non-candidate for the presidency, concluded that ""many [Democrats] have fallen into learned helplessness,"" as evidenced by the gap between their private doubts and their public assertions.

Writing for the San Francisco-based progressive daily, 48hills, Bruce Mirkin chastised the Democrats for choosing hopelessness over hope. ""Instead of 'yes, we can,'"" he wrote, ""the instinctive response from a good portion of the folks who should be helping to defend democracy seems to be 'no, we can't.'"" He then labeled the party's inaction ""learned helplessness."" Jordan Zakarin, writing for the Center for American Progress Action's Progress Report, extended that diagnosis from ""the worst debate performance in modern history"" to the larger moment in Washington. He pointed, for instance, to Attorney General Merrick Garland having ""slow-walked prosecuting Donald Trump."" ""It is,"" he concluded, ""a learned helplessness,"" a ""preemptive surrender.""

The question is: What should we make of the concept of ""learned helplessness""? Where did it come from and what are the remedies writ large? In this distinctly disturbing moment in our history, is it possible that an all-American version of despair and hopelessness has changed in light of Joe Biden's backing out of the presidential race?

The Psychological Concept

To better understand the sudden shower of references to ""learned helplessness,"" a little history is in order. In the late 1960s, psychologist Martin Seligman coined the term while conducting experiments with dogs. He had accidentally stumbled on the fact that dogs that experienced electrical shocks without having any control over starting or stopping them were ultimately rendered strangely passive. They proved unwilling to move, even to escape further mistreatment.

After more experiments demonstrated that being subjected to severe pain or stress did indeed induce a state of inaction in dogs, Seligman then turned to humans and discovered that individuals who had suffered an act or acts of trauma and abuse continued, well after the painful incident, to show signs of depression and anxiety that rendered them completely unable to act. They continued to exist, he discovered, in a state of profound resignation and inaction, long after the traumatic moment in which they found themselves powerless. Afterward, they were convinced that nothing was under their control, that any action they might take would be futile, and that failure was inevitable, should they even try to act. (Later studies suggested that some elderly individuals might also experience such a state of profound resignation and inaction in response to ""stressful life events,"" at times in association with dementia.)

But here's the truly strange thing: more than three decades later in the years after the 9/11 attacks, Seligman's concept of ""learned helplessness"" would be quite purposely baked into the interrogation and torture program created and implemented for war on terror detainees by American officials during the administration of President George W. Bush. As the executive summary of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's torture report explained, one of the two psychologists contracted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for the purpose of devising its interrogation program ""had reviewed research on 'learned helplessness,' in which individuals might become passive and depressed in response to adverse or uncontrollable events. He theorized,"" the report added, ""that inducing such a state could encourage a detainee to cooperate and provide information.""

That psychologist, Bruce Mitchell, even met with Seligman while designing techniques to use on war-on-terror detainees suspected of ties to the 9/11 terror group al-Qaeda and its leadership at the secret ""black sites"" the CIA set up globally. (Seligman, it seems, had no idea of the horrors Mitchell and his associates were planning.) Ironically enough, Seligman's findings and his concept of ""learned helplessness"" would indeed become a basic part of the development of the CIA's torture program. (Seligman would come to condemn the use of the concept for interrogations at those black sites. As The Washington Post reported, ""When [Seligman] later learned through media accounts how it was employed -- for enhanced interrogation -- he issued a statement: 'I am grieved and horrified that good science, which has helped so many people overcome depression, may have been used for such bad purposes.'"")

To induce a profound state of helplessness, those post-9/11 captives were sent to the CIA's black sites where they were subjected to ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" designed to elicit information from them. Their torture included beatings, being smashed into walls, being hung by their limbs in excruciatingly painful positions, forced nudity, sodomy, and repeated sleep deprivation, among other things. The CIA also used waterboarding (subjecting detainees to the feeling of drowning), placed them in coffin-like boxes, and threatened to use a gun or a power drill on those who refused to give answers sought by their interrogators. Just last month, in a pre-trial hearing at the forever prison the Bush administration set up offshore -- and away from the federal court system -- at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, in 2002, such techniques were once again described in detail, this time by John Bruce Jessen, the psychologist who, along with Mitchell, designed the nightmarish interrogation program. In addition to his testimony, he also demonstrated the technique of ""walling,"" which involved slamming a detainee's head against a wall.

The goal was simple: to reduce that prisoner to a profound state of complete paralysis and disempowerment in which, having no hope of relief or escape, he would do whatever his captors wanted. Detainees would see that there was no way out but to answer their captors' questions, which, it turned out, often led them, in desperation and a state of learned helplessness, to confess to things they hadn't done, to confess to whatever their captors wanted to hear.

Having studied and written about the nightmare of those prisoners and Guantánamo for so many years now, it's been supremely jarring to see the term ""learned helplessness"" re-emerge in connection to the current unnerving state of American politics and the 2024 presidential election. Yet, in many ways, it seems a strangely appropriate lens through which to view the world of Donald Trump and the rest of us. It was true, as many commented, that a sense of learned helplessness indisputably crept into the mindset of so many of us in this country -- at least prior to Joe Biden's decision not to pursue a second term as president.

The American people have indeed suffered multiple stressful, even traumatic experiences in recent years. The shock of a government that didn't protect them on September 11, 2001; the devastating experience of a president who refused to protect them from Covid, as bodies piled up on the streets of this country; the winnowing away of rights and liberties once protected by the Constitution and the Supreme Court -- from the overturning of Roe v. Wade to a rash of recent decisions, including one that gave a president essential immunity in relation to more or less anything he did, no matter how devastating; the inability of the courts to proceed in their prosecutions of Donald Trump; the nearly paralyzed state of a riven Congress amid an economic reality that has led so many younger Americans to be unable to purchase their own homes or send their children to college -- all have collectively cowed the population. Even before both the Supreme Court's presidential immunity decision and the dismal debate performance of Biden, a sense of learned helplessness seemed well in place, and understandably so.

The Republican Party has also succumbed to a state of learned helplessness. One after another, former opponents of Trump and the MAGA ideology he stands for have succumbed to his agenda and given up on pursuing their own independent goals. Republican vice-presidential nominee J.D. Vance is certainly a case in point. Having formerly called out Trump for his lack of morality, his xenophobia, and his racism, as well as for being a ""total fraud"" and ""America's Hitler,"" he is now on board with the ideas he once said he deplored, including, for example, an untethered anti-immigration stance that calls for massive deportations of illegal immigrants. Similarly, Trump's Republican election opponent Nikki Haley has given up her ""legacy of blunt assessments and brutal takedowns"" of the former president, as The Nation's John Nichols has aptly described her opposition to Trump, whom she once described as ""a dangerous stooge of Russian president Vladimir Putin.""

The question is: What, if anything, does the research tell us about curing such a state?

Is There, in Fact, a Cure?

Psychologists do point to remedies for such a profound state of hopelessness. They suggest several healing paths forward, including therapy to examine the causes of one's despair and to discover constructive paths beyond it; exercise to stimulate the body and the mind; and a commitment to ""learned optimism,"" a pattern of reaction geared to expecting the best rather than the worst out of any situation. As Psychology Today points out, ""Seligman later developed the concept of learned optimism. By explaining events to ourselves in a constructive manner and developing a positive internal dialogue, people can break free from their cycle of helplessness."" Small wins and an energized commitment to positivity are basic tenets of finding a way to ""learned optimism.""

If a turn towards optimism offers a way out of the helplessness of our times, perhaps we are seeing the beginning of just such an event. Recently, Slate's Dahlia Lithwick, again invoking the term ""learned helplessness,"" suggested that reports of the plans of the Biden administration to back Supreme Court reform were a sign of the kind of future ""systemwide cognitive reboot for American voters that seems almost inconceivable in the generalized torpor and despair of July 2024."" The headline of her article read, appropriately enough, ""Are We Finally Letting Go of Our Learned-Helplessness Syndrome Around the Supreme Court?""

Slow-moving Tropical Storm Debby bringing torrential rains, major flood threat to southeastern US

HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby has moved menacingly into some of America's most historic Southern cities in what is expected to be a prolonged event of torrential downpours and flooding after slamming into Florida with heavy rain and high winds. Record-setting rain from the storm that killed at least five people on Monday was causing flash flooding in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Savannah Mayor Van Johnson told residents Monday night to hunker down and expect a rough day on Tuesday. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida Monday as a Category 1 hurricane.

Israel-Hamas war latest: Palestinians killed in West Bank as world leaders try to avoid regional war

Four Palestinians have been killed and seven wounded by Israeli fire during a military raid in the occupied West Bank. World leaders meanwhile are trying to stop tensions in the Middle East from boiling over into a regional war after the killings of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon and Hamas' top political leader in Iran. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah says it launched a drone attack early Monday on northern Israel that the Israeli military said wounded two Israeli troops. Leaders in Egypt and Turkey say they are exhausting all avenues possible to prevent the Israel-Hamas war from becoming a wider regional conflict. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his Cabinet over the weekend that Israel is already in a ""multi-front war"" with Iran and its proxies.

Protesters who toppled Hasina want Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus to lead Bangladesh

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- A key organizer of Bangladesh's student protests says Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is their choice as head of an interim government a day after longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned. The country's figurehead president and the military chief said Monday that an interim government would be formed soon. Nahid Islam, the organizer, in a video post in social media said Tuesday the student protest leaders have already talked with Yunus, who consented to take over. Islam said the student protesters would announce more names for the government, and it would be a difficult challenge for the current leadership to ignore their choices.

Japan's share benchmark soars nearly 11% a day after massive sell-offs that shook Wall Street

NEW YORK (AP) -- Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index has soared more than 10% a day after it set markets tumbling in Europe and on Wall Street, while other world markets appeared to have settled after the rollercoaster ride that started the week. The Japanese index fell back after its biggest early advance, gaining 8.7% by midmorning on Tuesday. On Monday, nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as world markets quaked under fears the U.S. economy is slowing too much. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed the Nikkei's 12.4% plunge, its worst since 1987.

Venezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo ""falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council"" and they openly incited ""police and military officials to disobey the laws.""

Google illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge has ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Witnesses will tell a federal safety board about the blowout on a Boeing 737 Max earlier this year

The National Transportation Safety Board is about to hold a two-day hearing into the blowout of a panel from the side of a Boeing 737 Max airliner. The safety board's hearing starts Tuesday in Washington, D.C. It will hear from witnesses including its own investigators who have been looking into the Jan. 5 accident that occurred during an Alaska Airlines flight. The board is calling it a fact-finding hearing. The NTSB will not vote on a probable cause for the accident. That step probably won't happen for another year or longer after more investigation.

Hiroshima governor says nuclear disarmament must be tackled as a pressing issue, not an ideal

TOKYO (AP) -- Hiroshima officials are urging world leaders to stop relying on nuclear weapons as deterrence and take immediate action toward abolishment -- not as an ideal, but to remove the risk of atomic war amid the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. They commented Tuesday as the city remembered its atomic bombing 79 years ago at the end of World War II. The memorial comes days after Japan and the U.S. reaffirmed Washington's commitment to ""extended deterrence,"" including atomic weapons, to protect its Asian ally. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has vowed to do his utmost to pursue ""realistic and practical measures"" to build global momentum for nuclear disarmament. Critics say it is a hollow promise.

That was the chilling question the intruder posed to Paul Pelosi before bludgeoning the then-82-year-old over the head with a hammer in their San Francisco house. It echoed the menacing jeers of the rioters roaming the halls of the Capitol calling out ""Nancy, Nancy"" on Jan. 6.

Pelosi recounts her nearly four-decade legislative record in Congress but also allows a rare public glimpse into the private devastation around the assault on her husband. With it, she delivers a grave warning that the casual mockery and mimicry of political violence in America is chasing a generation from public service.

""We cannot ask people to serve in public life if the cost is risking the safety of their families and those they love.""

Pelosi's book pages through familiar terrain for those who have followed the 84-year-old's career, rising from ""housewife to House member to House speaker."" The steely California Democrat, the speaker emerita, is no longer in leadership but running for reelection to the House this fall.

She twice won the speakers gavel, worked alongside seven presidents and, more recently, played a pivotal role in quietly convincing President Joe Biden to reassess his decision to remain in the 2024 presidential election rematch with Republican Donald Trump. Biden bowed out.

But it's the first and final chapters that bring a new element to the Pelosi era, detailing in personal and painstaking ways the toll that America's violent strain is taking on civic life and public service.

""I don't know that we will ever feel safe,"" she writes.

Written well before the July assassination attempt on Trump, Pelosi's assessment of the nation's dangerous discourse arrives after back-to-back congressional shootings of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise and earlier of Democratic former Rep. Gabby Giffords, and it serves as a walk-off warning in what could be among her final years in Congress.

Pelosi recounts her disbelief at being ""pulled off the Speaker's platform"" and out of the House chamber by security the afternoon of Jan. 6 as rioters sent by Trump stormed through the halls, some searching for her.

""I can handle it,"" she protested, telling U.S. Capitol Police she wanted to stay and finish the work as Congress was certifying the 2020 election.

""Their response was curt,"" she writes. ""'No, you can't.'""

After being whisked away to safety at Fort McNair, she writes about huddling with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the three of them desperately calling the Pentagon to send National Guard troops to restore order at the Capitol. She describes House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump loyalist, as almost entirely unseen.

So worried about the rioters' threats against Vice President Mike Pence in hiding at the Capitol, she called and told him, ""Don't let anybody know where you are.""

""It still took three hours from the time I was dragged out of the House chamber for the Guard to arrive at the Capitol complex,"" she writes. ""It took about three and a half hours to clear the rioters from the building.""

Later, surveying the wreckage of broken glass and splintered wood, she was told of blood outside the Speaker's Lobby. In some places, including her office, the mob had ""literally defecated on the floors and rugs,"" she wrote. ""What was left behind was pure destruction.""

She recalled being in war zones, and in Kyiv at the start of the Russian invasion thinking she may well die in Ukraine. ""I briefly thought the same on January 6,"" she wrote.

""When I became Speaker, I knew that I was making myself into a target,"" she writes. ""However, our accepting the risk is something that is fundamentally different for our families.""

Not quite two years later, she was awakened in the middle of the night by the ""Knock. Knock. Knock. Pound, Pound. Pound,"" of the Capitol Police security detail at her door in Washington.

Pelosi recounts the dizzying hours, frantic family phone calls and flight back to San Francisco, the hospital, the surgeries and the long recovery for her husband. Their youngest daughter said he looked like a bandaged-up Frankenstein.

Her son, Paul Jr., went to the family's home to vacuum up the broken glass and clean up the blood. Her daughter Alexandra, who had been a high schooler when Pelosi first ran for Congress, told her, had she known what they were signing up for she would ""never have given you my blessing.""

The attacker was tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. But Pelosi writes, the story of Paul's attack would not go away.

""Our home remains a heartbreaking crime scene,"" she wrote.

Pelosi said her children told her that for a long time Paul would only sleep in the bedroom when she was there. He still suffers from headaches and dizzy spells, and she said she has seen him faint and fall twice from vertigo. As of February, she wrote, she was still changing bandages from surgery on his arm.

But the ""true horror"" she writes was the dehumanizing jokes by Republicans from Trump on down, including the former president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who posted a Paul Pelosi Halloween costume to social media, and the way the crowds would ""laugh, cheer, and applaud"" their cruel remarks.

""It made me profoundly sad for our country,"" she writes.

Pelosi situates the two bloody episodes in the arc of her career, from the way Republicans vilified her in countless campaign ads from the time she first rose as Democratic leader to the way protesters spit on Democrats, including civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, the day the House voted for the Affordable Care Act, to the severed pig's head left outside her family's home in the days before Jan. 6.

Pelosi writes that when she speaks to young people about running for office, ""especially young women, too often I hear their reluctance to put their families in harm's way."""

Pelosi situates the two bloody episodes in the arc of her career, from the way Republicans vilified her in countless campaign ads from the time she first rose as Democratic leader to the way protesters spit on Democrats, including civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, the day the House voted for the Affordable Care Act, to the severed pig's head left outside her family's home in the days before Jan. 6.

Pelosi writes that when she speaks to young people about running for office, ""especially young women, too often I hear their reluctance to put their families in harm's way.""

""This is not the way our country should be -- if you engage in public service, you should not be a target, and your family should not be a target."""
2024-08-06,-0.2784,"Imagine my surprise when, nearly eight months ago, commenting on the state of the country as it approached the 2024 presidential election, New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg noted that ""Biden has set himself the task of trying to jolt the country out of its learned helplessness in the face of Trump's exhausting provocations."" Unbeknownst to most Americans, that term, ""learned helplessness,"" was profoundly and inextricably tied to this country's disastrous post-9/11 Global War on Terror and, in particular, its horrifying torture program. Yet there it was, being used in a new context -- one that, while perhaps altered by the president's recent decision not to run for a second term, has been employed with remarkable frequency in the intervening months, especially recently, when it comes to this country's presidential future.

As the pundits weighed in on Joe Biden's abysmal performance at that June 27th debate with Donald Trump and cast doubt on his prospects for reelection, ""learned helplessness"" was used over and over again in the days leading up to his withdrawal from the presidential race in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris. Two days after the debate, for instance, The Economist, focusing on Biden's refusal to declare himself a non-candidate for the presidency, concluded that ""many [Democrats] have fallen into learned helplessness,"" as evidenced by the gap between their private doubts and their public assertions.

Writing for the San Francisco-based progressive daily, 48hills, Bruce Mirkin chastised the Democrats for choosing hopelessness over hope. ""Instead of 'yes, we can,'"" he wrote, ""the instinctive response from a good portion of the folks who should be helping to defend democracy seems to be 'no, we can't.'"" He then labeled the party's inaction ""learned helplessness."" Jordan Zakarin, writing for the Center for American Progress Action's Progress Report, extended that diagnosis from ""the worst debate performance in modern history"" to the larger moment in Washington. He pointed, for instance, to Attorney General Merrick Garland having ""slow-walked prosecuting Donald Trump."" ""It is,"" he concluded, ""a learned helplessness,"" a ""preemptive surrender.""

The question is: What should we make of the concept of ""learned helplessness""? Where did it come from and what are the remedies writ large? In this distinctly disturbing moment in our history, is it possible that an all-American version of despair and hopelessness has changed in light of Joe Biden's backing out of the presidential race?

The Psychological Concept

To better understand the sudden shower of references to ""learned helplessness,"" a little history is in order. In the late 1960s, psychologist Martin Seligman coined the term while conducting experiments with dogs. He had accidentally stumbled on the fact that dogs that experienced electrical shocks without having any control over starting or stopping them were ultimately rendered strangely passive. They proved unwilling to move, even to escape further mistreatment.

After more experiments demonstrated that being subjected to severe pain or stress did indeed induce a state of inaction in dogs, Seligman then turned to humans and discovered that individuals who had suffered an act or acts of trauma and abuse continued, well after the painful incident, to show signs of depression and anxiety that rendered them completely unable to act. They continued to exist, he discovered, in a state of profound resignation and inaction, long after the traumatic moment in which they found themselves powerless. Afterward, they were convinced that nothing was under their control, that any action they might take would be futile, and that failure was inevitable, should they even try to act. (Later studies suggested that some elderly individuals might also experience such a state of profound resignation and inaction in response to ""stressful life events,"" at times in association with dementia.)

But here's the truly strange thing: more than three decades later in the years after the 9/11 attacks, Seligman's concept of ""learned helplessness"" would be quite purposely baked into the interrogation and torture program created and implemented for war on terror detainees by American officials during the administration of President George W. Bush. As the executive summary of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's torture report explained, one of the two psychologists contracted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for the purpose of devising its interrogation program ""had reviewed research on 'learned helplessness,' in which individuals might become passive and depressed in response to adverse or uncontrollable events. He theorized,"" the report added, ""that inducing such a state could encourage a detainee to cooperate and provide information.""

That psychologist, Bruce Mitchell, even met with Seligman while designing techniques to use on war-on-terror detainees suspected of ties to the 9/11 terror group al-Qaeda and its leadership at the secret ""black sites"" the CIA set up globally. (Seligman, it seems, had no idea of the horrors Mitchell and his associates were planning.) Ironically enough, Seligman's findings and his concept of ""learned helplessness"" would indeed become a basic part of the development of the CIA's torture program. (Seligman would come to condemn the use of the concept for interrogations at those black sites. As The Washington Post reported, ""When [Seligman] later learned through media accounts how it was employed -- for enhanced interrogation -- he issued a statement: 'I am grieved and horrified that good science, which has helped so many people overcome depression, may have been used for such bad purposes.'"")

To induce a profound state of helplessness, those post-9/11 captives were sent to the CIA's black sites where they were subjected to ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" designed to elicit information from them. Their torture included beatings, being smashed into walls, being hung by their limbs in excruciatingly painful positions, forced nudity, sodomy, and repeated sleep deprivation, among other things. The CIA also used waterboarding (subjecting detainees to the feeling of drowning), placed them in coffin-like boxes, and threatened to use a gun or a power drill on those who refused to give answers sought by their interrogators. Just last month, in a pre-trial hearing at the forever prison the Bush administration set up offshore -- and away from the federal court system -- at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, in 2002, such techniques were once again described in detail, this time by John Bruce Jessen, the psychologist who, along with Mitchell, designed the nightmarish interrogation program. In addition to his testimony, he also demonstrated the technique of ""walling,"" which involved slamming a detainee's head against a wall.

The goal was simple: to reduce that prisoner to a profound state of complete paralysis and disempowerment in which, having no hope of relief or escape, he would do whatever his captors wanted. Detainees would see that there was no way out but to answer their captors' questions, which, it turned out, often led them, in desperation and a state of learned helplessness, to confess to things they hadn't done, to confess to whatever their captors wanted to hear.

Having studied and written about the nightmare of those prisoners and Guantánamo for so many years now, it's been supremely jarring to see the term ""learned helplessness"" re-emerge in connection to the current unnerving state of American politics and the 2024 presidential election. Yet, in many ways, it seems a strangely appropriate lens through which to view the world of Donald Trump and the rest of us. It was true, as many commented, that a sense of learned helplessness indisputably crept into the mindset of so many of us in this country -- at least prior to Joe Biden's decision not to pursue a second term as president.

The American people have indeed suffered multiple stressful, even traumatic experiences in recent years. The shock of a government that didn't protect them on September 11, 2001; the devastating experience of a president who refused to protect them from Covid, as bodies piled up on the streets of this country; the winnowing away of rights and liberties once protected by the Constitution and the Supreme Court -- from the overturning of Roe v. Wade to a rash of recent decisions, including one that gave a president essential immunity in relation to more or less anything he did, no matter how devastating; the inability of the courts to proceed in their prosecutions of Donald Trump; the nearly paralyzed state of a riven Congress amid an economic reality that has led so many younger Americans to be unable to purchase their own homes or send their children to college -- all have collectively cowed the population. Even before both the Supreme Court's presidential immunity decision and the dismal debate performance of Biden, a sense of learned helplessness seemed well in place, and understandably so.

The Republican Party has also succumbed to a state of learned helplessness. One after another, former opponents of Trump and the MAGA ideology he stands for have succumbed to his agenda and given up on pursuing their own independent goals. Republican vice-presidential nominee J.D. Vance is certainly a case in point. Having formerly called out Trump for his lack of morality, his xenophobia, and his racism, as well as for being a ""total fraud"" and ""America's Hitler,"" he is now on board with the ideas he once said he deplored, including, for example, an untethered anti-immigration stance that calls for massive deportations of illegal immigrants. Similarly, Trump's Republican election opponent Nikki Haley has given up her ""legacy of blunt assessments and brutal takedowns"" of the former president, as The Nation's John Nichols has aptly described her opposition to Trump, whom she once described as ""a dangerous stooge of Russian president Vladimir Putin.""

The question is: What, if anything, does the research tell us about curing such a state?

Is There, in Fact, a Cure?

Psychologists do point to remedies for such a profound state of hopelessness. They suggest several healing paths forward, including therapy to examine the causes of one's despair and to discover constructive paths beyond it; exercise to stimulate the body and the mind; and a commitment to ""learned optimism,"" a pattern of reaction geared to expecting the best rather than the worst out of any situation. As Psychology Today points out, ""Seligman later developed the concept of learned optimism. By explaining events to ourselves in a constructive manner and developing a positive internal dialogue, people can break free from their cycle of helplessness."" Small wins and an energized commitment to positivity are basic tenets of finding a way to ""learned optimism.""

If a turn towards optimism offers a way out of the helplessness of our times, perhaps we are seeing the beginning of just such an event. Recently, Slate's Dahlia Lithwick, again invoking the term ""learned helplessness,"" suggested that reports of the plans of the Biden administration to back Supreme Court reform were a sign of the kind of future ""systemwide cognitive reboot for American voters that seems almost inconceivable in the generalized torpor and despair of July 2024."" The headline of her article read, appropriately enough, ""Are We Finally Letting Go of Our Learned-Helplessness Syndrome Around the Supreme Court?""

So, too, the outpouring of energy and excitement following Biden's decision to bow out of the presidential race and the enthusiasm for newer, younger Democratic Party leadership -- and for Vice President Kamala Harris, in particular -- already seems eons removed from the head-shaking resignation of Democratic voters confronting a ""choice"" between an aging Joe Biden and You Know Who on election day. In fact, in many ways, that new turn of affairs could be just what the doctor ordered, though, of course, a possible November election victory for Donald Trump could still put the phrase ""learned helplessness"" in a grimly new light.

For Democrats, the idea that there could be a brighter future, one in which a sense of control replaced one of powerlessness -- an election in which their presidential candidate has a viable chance of winning -- has taken hold. In place of anxiety and depression, there is optimism, or at least a ""cautious hope."" Declaring her ""immense pride and limitless optimism for our country's future,"" Nancy Pelosi echoed the importance of this newfound optimism when endorsing Kamala Harris as the party's candidate for 2024. As Tim Alberta summed it up in The Atlantic, ""As far back as springtime, the numbers told a straightforward story: Biden was not going to win. Democrats could only look on, powerless."" However, now, he concludes, it is the Republicans who are feeling hope and control fade away: ""Sunday brought an unfamiliar feeling of powerlessness. For the first time in a long time, Trump does not control the narrative of 2024.""

Whether or not such optimism gains momentum in the potentially tumultuous days ahead remains to be seen, as does whether the Republicans can find a way out of their own potential sense of learned helplessness in the face of a changing scenario. Whatever happens, given what I know about the past use of that phrase and the nightmare of the war on terror's use of torture, my own hope is that, with election 2024, the very concept of learned helplessness and the realities it represents, whether it applies to torture at the hands of the U.S. government or suffering at the hands of Trumpian politics, can finally be politically laid to rest.

Call it learned optimism, if you wish, but fingers crossed."

Slow-moving Tropical Storm Debby bringing torrential rains, major flood threat to southeastern US

HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby has moved menacingly into some of America's most historic Southern cities in what is expected to be a prolonged event of torrential downpours and flooding after slamming into Florida with heavy rain and high winds. Record-setting rain from the storm that killed at least five people on Monday was causing flash flooding in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Savannah Mayor Van Johnson told residents Monday night to hunker down and expect a rough day on Tuesday. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida Monday as a Category 1 hurricane.

Bangladesh protesters want Nobel Peace Prize laureate Yunus to lead country after Hasina's departure

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- A key organizer of Bangladesh's student protests says Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is their choice as head of an interim government a day after the longtime Prime Minister Sheik Hasina resigned. The country's figurehead president and the military chief said Monday that an interim government would be formed soon. Nahid Islam, the organizer, in a video post in social media said Tuesday the student protest leaders have already talked with Yunus, who consented to take over. Islam said the student protesters would announce more names for the government, and it would be a difficult challenge for the current leadership to ignore their choices.

Japan's share benchmark soars nearly 11% a day after massive sell-offs that shook Wall Street

NEW YORK (AP) -- Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index has soared more than 10% a day after it set markets tumbling in Europe and on Wall Street, while other world markets appeared to have settled after the rollercoaster ride that started the week. The Japanese index fell back after its biggest early advance, gaining 8.7% by midmorning on Tuesday. On Monday, nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as world markets quaked under fears the U.S. economy is slowing too much. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed the Nikkei's 12.4% plunge, its worst since 1987.

Proxy forces armed by Iran could take part in retaliation against Israel over Hamas leader's killing

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- As Iran threatens to respond to the suspected Israeli assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, the regional militias that the Islamic Republic has armed for decades could play a role in any attack. They include Lebanon's Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels of Yemen, Shiite militias in Iraq and others. Those relationships are managed by Iran's powerful paramilitary organization, the Revolutionary Guard. Iran relies on those proxy forces as international sanctions on Tehran, including over its nuclear program, have kept it from receiving advanced weaponry. While developing its own missile program, Iran also relies on militias as an asymmetric threat to squeeze Israel and the United States.

Venezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo ""falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council"" and they openly incited ""police and military officials to disobey the laws.""

Google illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge has ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

The National Transportation Safety Board is about to hold a two-day hearing into the blowout of a panel from the side of a Boeing 737 Max airliner. The safety board's hearing starts Tuesday in Washington, D.C. It will hear from witnesses including its own investigators who have been looking into the Jan. 5 accident that occurred during an Alaska Airlines flight. The board is calling it a fact-finding hearing. The NTSB will not vote on a probable cause for the accident. That step probably won't happen for another year or longer after more investigation.

Hiroshima governor says nuclear disarmament must be tackled as a pressing issue, not an ideal

TOKYO (AP) -- Hiroshima officials are urging world leaders to stop relying on nuclear weapons as deterrence and take immediate action toward abolishment -- not as an ideal, but to remove the risk of atomic war amid the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. They commented Tuesday as the city remembered its atomic bombing 79 years ago at the end of World War II. The memorial comes days after Japan and the U.S. reaffirmed Washington's commitment to ""extended deterrence,"" including atomic weapons, to protect its Asian ally. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has vowed to do his utmost to pursue ""realistic and practical measures"" to build global momentum for nuclear disarmament. Critics say it is a hollow promise.

Less than two years later, the threat of political violence would materialize her husband at their home.

""Where's Nancy? Where's Nancy?""

That was the chilling question the intruder asked us. Paul Pelosi before hitting the then 82-year-old over the head with a hammer in their San Francisco home. echoed the menacing booing of the rioters who roamed the halls of the Capitol on January 6, chanting ""Nancy, Nancy.""

The continuous line of escalating political rhetoric and violence in American public life form the opening and closing messages of Pelosi's new book, ""The Art of Power, My Story as America's First Woman Speaker of the House.""

""We cannot ask people to serve in public life if the price of doing so puts the safety of their families and loved ones at risk.""

Pelosi's book covers familiar ground for those who have followed the 84-year-old's rise from ""homemaker to House Speaker."" The steely California Democrat, the speaker emeritus, is no longer leader but is running for reelection to the House this fall.

She has won the gavel twice, worked with seven presidents, and recently played a crucial role in quietly convincing President Joe Biden Unpleasant reconsider his decision to remain with the Republicans in the 2024 presidential election rematch Donald Trump. Biden curved.

But it is the first and last chapters that add a new element to the Pelosi era, chronicling in personal and meticulous detail the toll violence has taken on American civic life and public services.

""I don't know if we will ever feel safe,"" she writes.

Pelosi's assessment of the nation's dangerous discourse, written well before the attempted assassination of Trump in July, comes after back-to-back shootings in Congress of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise and earlier of former Democrat Gabby Giffords, and it serves as a warning of a departure in what could be one of her last years in Congress.

Pelosi has recounted her disbelief as she was ""dragged"" from the speaker's dais by security and escorted out of the House chamber on the afternoon of January 6, as rioters sent by Trump stormed through the halls, some searching for her.

""I can handle it,"" she protested, telling U.S. Capitol Police she wanted to stay and finish the job while Congress certifies the 2020 election.

""Their response was curt,"" she writes. ""'No, that's not possible.'""

After being taken to safety at Fort McNair, she writes about her meeting with Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, all three of whom desperately called on the Pentagon to send in National Guard troops to restore order to the Capitol. She describes Republican House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump loyalist, as almost completely invisible.

She was so concerned about the rioters' threats against Vice President Mike Pence, who was hiding in the Capitol, that she called him and told him, ""Don't let anyone know where you are.""

""It still took three hours from the time I was dragged out of the House chamber before the Guard arrived at the Capitol complex,"" she wrote. ""It took approximately three and a half hours to get the rioters out of the building.""

Later, as she surveyed the mess of broken glass and splintered wood, she was told there was blood outside the chairman's lobby. In some places, including her office, the mob had ""literally defecated on the floors and carpets,"" she wrote. ""What was left behind was pure destruction.""

She remembered being in war zones and in Kiev at the beginning of the Russian invasion, thinking she might die in Ukraine. ""I thought the same thing for a moment on January 6,"" she wrote.

""When I became Speaker, I knew I was making myself a target,"" she writes. ""But accepting the risk is something fundamentally different for our families.""

Less than two years later, she was awakened in the middle of the night by the ""Knock. Knock. Knock. Pound, Pound. Pound"" of Capitol Police security at her door in Washington.

""The officers' facial expressions were grim,"" she writes.

Pelosi recounts the dizzying hours, frantic family phone calls, the flight back to San Francisco, the hospital, the surgeries and the long recovery for her husband. Their youngest daughter said he looked like a bandaged Frankenstein.

Her son, Paul Jr., went to the family's home to vacuum up the broken glass and clean up the blood. Her daughter Alexandra, who was in high school when Pelosi first ran for Congress, told her that if she had known what they were running for, ""I never would have given you my blessing.""

The attacker was tried, convicted, and sentenced to prison. But Pelosi writes that the story of Paul's attack would not go away.

""Our home is still a heartbreaking crime scene,"" she wrote.

Pelosi said her children told her that Paul slept alone in the bedroom for long periods of time when she was there. He still suffers from headaches and dizziness, and she said she has seen him faint and fall twice from dizziness. In February, she wrote, she was still changing bandages after surgery on his arm.

""It made me deeply sad for our country,"" she wrote.

Pelosi places the two bloody episodes within the span of her career, from the way Republicans smeared her in countless campaign ads from the moment she first became Democratic leader to the way protesters spat on Democrats, including civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, the day the House voted to pass the Affordable Care Act to the severed pig's head left outside her family's home in the days leading up to Jan. 6.

Slow-moving Tropical Storm Debby bringing torrential rains, major flood threat to southeastern US

HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby has moved menacingly into some of America's most historic Southern cities in what is expected to be a prolonged event of torrential downpours and flooding after slamming into Florida with heavy rain and high winds. Record-setting rain from the storm that killed at least five people on Monday was causing flash flooding in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Savannah Mayor Van Johnson told residents Monday night to hunker down and expect a rough day on Tuesday. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida Monday as a Category 1 hurricane.

Bangladesh protesters want Nobel Peace Prize laureate Yunus to lead country after Hasina's departure

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- A key organizer of Bangladesh's student protests says Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is their choice as head of an interim government a day after the longtime Prime Minister Sheik Hasina resigned. The country's figurehead president and the military chief said Monday that an interim government would be formed soon. Nahid Islam, the organizer, in a video post in social media said Tuesday the student protest leaders have already talked with Yunus, who consented to take over. Islam said the student protesters would announce more names for the government, and it would be a difficult challenge for the current leadership to ignore their choices.

Japan's share benchmark soars nearly 11% a day after massive sell-offs that shook Wall Street

NEW YORK (AP) -- Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index has soared more than 10% a day after it set markets tumbling in Europe and on Wall Street, while other world markets appeared to have settled after the rollercoaster ride that started the week. The Japanese index fell back after its biggest early advance, gaining 8.7% by midmorning on Tuesday. On Monday, nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as world markets quaked under fears the U.S. economy is slowing too much. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed the Nikkei's 12.4% plunge, its worst since 1987.

Proxy forces armed by Iran could take part in retaliation against Israel over Hamas leader's killing

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- As Iran threatens to respond to the suspected Israeli assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, the regional militias that the Islamic Republic has armed for decades could play a role in any attack. They include Lebanon's Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels of Yemen, Shiite militias in Iraq and others. Those relationships are managed by Iran's powerful paramilitary organization, the Revolutionary Guard. Iran relies on those proxy forces as international sanctions on Tehran, including over its nuclear program, have kept it from receiving advanced weaponry. While developing its own missile program, Iran also relies on militias as an asymmetric threat to squeeze Israel and the United States.

Venezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo ""falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council"" and they openly incited ""police and military officials to disobey the laws.""

Google illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge has ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Witnesses will tell a federal safety board about the blowout on a Boeing 737 Max earlier this year

The National Transportation Safety Board is about to hold a two-day hearing into the blowout of a panel from the side of a Boeing 737 Max airliner. The safety board's hearing starts Tuesday in Washington, D.C. It will hear from witnesses including its own investigators who have been looking into the Jan. 5 accident that occurred during an Alaska Airlines flight. The board is calling it a fact-finding hearing. The NTSB will not vote on a probable cause for the accident. That step probably won't happen for another year or longer after more investigation.

Hiroshima governor says nuclear disarmament must be tackled as a pressing issue, not an ideal

TOKYO (AP) -- Hiroshima officials are urging world leaders to stop relying on nuclear weapons as deterrence and take immediate action toward abolishment -- not as an ideal, but to remove the risk of atomic war amid the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. They commented Tuesday as the city remembered its atomic bombing 79 years ago at the end of World War II. The memorial comes days after Japan and the U.S. reaffirmed Washington's commitment to ""extended deterrence,"" including atomic weapons, to protect its Asian ally. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has vowed to do his utmost to pursue ""realistic and practical measures"" to build global momentum for nuclear disarmament. Critics say it is a hollow promise.

2024-08-06,-0.2784,"Imagine my surprise when, nearly eight months ago, commenting on the state of the country as it approached the 2024 presidential election, New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg noted that ""Biden has set himself the task of trying to jolt the country out of its learned helplessness in the face of Trump's exhausting provocations."" Unbeknownst to most Americans, that term, ""learned helplessness,"" was profoundly and inextricably tied to this country's disastrous post-9/11 Global War on Terror and, in particular, its horrifying torture program. Yet there it was, being used in a new context -- one that, while perhaps altered by the president's recent decision not to run for a second term, has been employed with remarkable frequency in the intervening months, especially recently, when it comes to this country's presidential future.

As the pundits weighed in on Joe Biden's abysmal performance at that June 27th debate with Donald Trump and cast doubt on his prospects for reelection, ""learned helplessness"" was used over and over again in the days leading up to his withdrawal from the presidential race in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris. Two days after the debate, for instance, The Economist, focusing on Biden's refusal to declare himself a non-candidate for the presidency, concluded that ""many [Democrats] have fallen into learned helplessness,"" as evidenced by the gap between their private doubts and their public assertions.

Writing for the San Francisco-based progressive daily, 48hills, Bruce Mirkin chastised the Democrats for choosing hopelessness over hope. ""Instead of 'yes, we can,'"" he wrote, ""the instinctive response from a good portion of the folks who should be helping to defend democracy seems to be 'no, we can't.'"" He then labeled the party's inaction ""learned helplessness."" Jordan Zakarin, writing for the Center for American Progress Action's Progress Report, extended that diagnosis from ""the worst debate performance in modern history"" to the larger moment in Washington. He pointed, for instance, to Attorney General Merrick Garland having ""slow-walked prosecuting Donald Trump."" ""It is,"" he concluded, ""a learned helplessness,"" a ""preemptive surrender.""

The question is: What should we make of the concept of ""learned helplessness""? Where did it come from and what are the remedies writ large? In this distinctly disturbing moment in our history, is it possible that an all-American version of despair and hopelessness has changed in light of Joe Biden's backing out of the presidential race?

The Psychological Concept

To better understand the sudden shower of references to ""learned helplessness,"" a little history is in order. In the late 1960s, psychologist Martin Seligman coined the term while conducting experiments with dogs. He had accidentally stumbled on the fact that dogs that experienced electrical shocks without having any control over starting or stopping them were ultimately rendered strangely passive. They proved unwilling to move, even to escape further mistreatment.

After more experiments demonstrated that being subjected to severe pain or stress did indeed induce a state of inaction in dogs, Seligman then turned to humans and discovered that individuals who had suffered an act or acts of trauma and abuse continued, well after the painful incident, to show signs of depression and anxiety that rendered them completely unable to act. They continued to exist, he discovered, in a state of profound resignation and inaction, long after the traumatic moment in which they found themselves powerless. Afterward, they were convinced that nothing was under their control, that any action they might take would be futile, and that failure was inevitable, should they even try to act. (Later studies suggested that some elderly individuals might also experience such a state of profound resignation and inaction in response to ""stressful life events,"" at times in association with dementia.)

But here's the truly strange thing: more than three decades later in the years after the 9/11 attacks, Seligman's concept of ""learned helplessness"" would be quite purposely baked into the interrogation and torture program created and implemented for war on terror detainees by American officials during the administration of President George W. Bush. As the executive summary of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's torture report explained, one of the two psychologists contracted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for the purpose of devising its interrogation program ""had reviewed research on 'learned helplessness,' in which individuals might become passive and depressed in response to adverse or uncontrollable events. He theorized,"" the report added, ""that inducing such a state could encourage a detainee to cooperate and provide information.""

That psychologist, Bruce Mitchell, even met with Seligman while designing techniques to use on war-on-terror detainees suspected of ties to the 9/11 terror group al-Qaeda and its leadership at the secret ""black sites"" the CIA set up globally. (Seligman, it seems, had no idea of the horrors Mitchell and his associates were planning.) Ironically enough, Seligman's findings and his concept of ""learned helplessness"" would indeed become a basic part of the development of the CIA's torture program. (Seligman would come to condemn the use of the concept for interrogations at those black sites. As The Washington Post reported, ""When [Seligman] later learned through media accounts how it was employed -- for enhanced interrogation -- he issued a statement: 'I am grieved and horrified that good science, which has helped so many people overcome depression, may have been used for such bad purposes.'"")

To induce a profound state of helplessness, those post-9/11 captives were sent to the CIA's black sites where they were subjected to ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" designed to elicit information from them. Their torture included beatings, being smashed into walls, being hung by their limbs in excruciatingly painful positions, forced nudity, sodomy, and repeated sleep deprivation, among other things. The CIA also used waterboarding (subjecting detainees to the feeling of drowning), placed them in coffin-like boxes, and threatened to use a gun or a power drill on those who refused to give answers sought by their interrogators. Just last month, in a pre-trial hearing at the forever prison the Bush administration set up offshore -- and away from the federal court system -- at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, in 2002, such techniques were once again described in detail, this time by John Bruce Jessen, the psychologist who, along with Mitchell, designed the nightmarish interrogation program. In addition to his testimony, he also demonstrated the technique of ""walling,"" which involved slamming a detainee's head against a wall.

The goal was simple: to reduce that prisoner to a profound state of complete paralysis and disempowerment in which, having no hope of relief or escape, he would do whatever his captors wanted. Detainees would see that there was no way out but to answer their captors' questions, which, it turned out, often led them, in desperation and a state of learned helplessness, to confess to things they hadn't done, to confess to whatever their captors wanted to hear.

Having studied and written about the nightmare of those prisoners and Guantánamo for so many years now, it's been supremely jarring to see the term ""learned helplessness"" re-emerge in connection to the current unnerving state of American politics and the 2024 presidential election. Yet, in many ways, it seems a strangely appropriate lens through which to view the world of Donald Trump and the rest of us. It was true, as many commented, that a sense of learned helplessness indisputably crept into the mindset of so many of us in this country -- at least prior to Joe Biden's decision not to pursue a second term as president.

The American people have indeed suffered multiple stressful, even traumatic experiences in recent years. The shock of a government that didn't protect them on September 11, 2001; the devastating experience of a president who refused to protect them from Covid, as bodies piled up on the streets of this country; the winnowing away of rights and liberties once protected by the Constitution and the Supreme Court -- from the overturning of Roe v. Wade to a rash of recent decisions, including one that gave a president essential immunity in relation to more or less anything he did, no matter how devastating; the inability of the courts to proceed in their prosecutions of Donald Trump; the nearly paralyzed state of a riven Congress amid an economic reality that has led so many younger Americans to be unable to purchase their own homes or send their children to college -- all have collectively cowed the population. Even before both the Supreme Court's presidential immunity decision and the dismal debate performance of Biden, a sense of learned helplessness seemed well in place, and understandably so.

The Republican Party has also succumbed to a state of learned helplessness. One after another, former opponents of Trump and the MAGA ideology he stands for have succumbed to his agenda and given up on pursuing their own independent goals. Republican vice-presidential nominee J.D. Vance is certainly a case in point. Having formerly called out Trump for his lack of morality, his xenophobia, and his racism, as well as for being a ""total fraud"" and ""America's Hitler,"" he is now on board with the ideas he once said he deplored, including, for example, an untethered anti-immigration stance that calls for massive deportations of illegal immigrants. Similarly, Trump's Republican election opponent Nikki Haley has given up her ""legacy of blunt assessments and brutal takedowns"" of the former president, as The Nation's John Nichols has aptly described her opposition to Trump, whom she once described as ""a dangerous stooge of Russian president Vladimir Putin.""

The question is: What, if anything, does the research tell us about curing such a state?

Is There, in Fact, a Cure?

Psychologists do point to remedies for such a profound state of hopelessness. They suggest several healing paths forward, including therapy to examine the causes of one's despair and to discover constructive paths beyond it; exercise to stimulate the body and the mind; and a commitment to ""learned optimism,"" a pattern of reaction geared to expecting the best rather than the worst out of any situation. As Psychology Today points out, ""Seligman later developed the concept of learned optimism. By explaining events to ourselves in a constructive manner and developing a positive internal dialogue, people can break free from their cycle of helplessness."" Small wins and an energized commitment to positivity are basic tenets of finding a way to ""learned optimism.""

If a turn towards optimism offers a way out of the helplessness of our times, perhaps we are seeing the beginning of just such an event. Recently, Slate's Dahlia Lithwick, again invoking the term ""learned helplessness,"" suggested that reports of the plans of the Biden administration to back Supreme Court reform were a sign of the kind of future ""systemwide cognitive reboot for American voters that seems almost inconceivable in the generalized torpor and despair of July 2024."" The headline of her article read, appropriately enough, ""Are We Finally Letting Go of Our Learned-Helplessness Syndrome Around the Supreme Court?""

So, too, the outpouring of energy and excitement following Biden's decision to bow out of the presidential race and the enthusiasm for newer, younger Democratic Party leadership -- and for Vice President Kamala Harris, in particular -- already seems eons removed from the head-shaking resignation of Democratic voters confronting a ""choice"" between an aging Joe Biden and You Know Who on election day. In fact, in many ways, that new turn of affairs could be just what the doctor ordered, though, of course, a possible November election victory for Donald Trump could still put the phrase ""learned helplessness"" in a grimly new light.

For Democrats, the idea that there could be a brighter future, one in which a sense of control replaced one of powerlessness -- an election in which their presidential candidate has a viable chance of winning -- has taken hold. In place of anxiety and depression, there is optimism, or at least a ""cautious hope."" Declaring her ""immense pride and limitless optimism for our country's future,"" Nancy Pelosi echoed the importance of this newfound optimism when endorsing Kamala Harris as the party's candidate for 2024. As Tim Alberta summed it up in The Atlantic, ""As far back as springtime, the numbers told a straightforward story: Biden was not going to win. Democrats could only look on, powerless."" However, now, he concludes, it is the Republicans who are feeling hope and control fade away: ""Sunday brought an unfamiliar feeling of powerlessness. For the first time in a long time, Trump does not control the narrative of 2024.""

Whether or not such optimism gains momentum in the potentially tumultuous days ahead remains to be seen, as does whether the Republicans can find a way out of their own potential sense of learned helplessness in the face of a changing scenario. Whatever happens, given what I know about the past use of that phrase and the nightmare of the war on terror's use of torture, my own hope is that, with election 2024, the very concept of learned helplessness and the realities it represents, whether it applies to torture at the hands of the U.S. government or suffering at the hands of Trumpian politics, can finally be politically laid to rest.

Call it learned optimism, if you wish, but fingers crossed."

Slow-moving Tropical Storm Debby bringing torrential rains, major flood threat to southeastern US

HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby has moved menacingly into some of America's most historic Southern cities in what is expected to be a prolonged event of torrential downpours and flooding after slamming into Florida with heavy rain and high winds. Record-setting rain from the storm that killed at least five people on Monday was causing flash flooding in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Savannah Mayor Van Johnson told residents Monday night to hunker down and expect a rough day on Tuesday. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida Monday as a Category 1 hurricane.

Bangladesh protesters want Nobel Peace Prize laureate Yunus to lead country after Hasina's departure

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- A key organizer of Bangladesh's student protests says Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is their choice as head of an interim government a day after the longtime Prime Minister Sheik Hasina resigned. The country's figurehead president and the military chief said Monday that an interim government would be formed soon. Nahid Islam, the organizer, in a video post in social media said Tuesday the student protest leaders have already talked with Yunus, who consented to take over. Islam said the student protesters would announce more names for the government, and it would be a difficult challenge for the current leadership to ignore their choices.

Japan's share benchmark soars nearly 11% a day after massive sell-offs that shook Wall Street

NEW YORK (AP) -- Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index has soared more than 10% a day after it set markets tumbling in Europe and on Wall Street, while other world markets appeared to have settled after the rollercoaster ride that started the week. The Japanese index fell back after its biggest early advance, gaining 8.7% by midmorning on Tuesday. On Monday, nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as world markets quaked under fears the U.S. economy is slowing too much. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed the Nikkei's 12.4% plunge, its worst since 1987.

Proxy forces armed by Iran could take part in retaliation against Israel over Hamas leader's killing

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- As Iran threatens to respond to the suspected Israeli assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, the regional militias that the Islamic Republic has armed for decades could play a role in any attack. They include Lebanon's Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels of Yemen, Shiite militias in Iraq and others. Those relationships are managed by Iran's powerful paramilitary organization, the Revolutionary Guard. Iran relies on those proxy forces as international sanctions on Tehran, including over its nuclear program, have kept it from receiving advanced weaponry. While developing its own missile program, Iran also relies on militias as an asymmetric threat to squeeze Israel and the United States.

Venezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo ""falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council"" and they openly incited ""police and military officials to disobey the laws.""

Google illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge has ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Witnesses will tell a federal safety board about the blowout on a Boeing 737 Max earlier this year

The National Transportation Safety Board is about to hold a two-day hearing into the blowout of a panel from the side of a Boeing 737 Max airliner. The safety board's hearing starts Tuesday in Washington, D.C. It will hear from witnesses including its own investigators who have been looking into the Jan. 5 accident that occurred during an Alaska Airlines flight. The board is calling it a fact-finding hearing. The NTSB will not vote on a probable cause for the accident. That step probably won't happen for another year or longer after more investigation.

Hiroshima governor says nuclear disarmament must be tackled as a pressing issue, not an ideal

TOKYO (AP) -- Hiroshima officials are urging world leaders to stop relying on nuclear weapons as deterrence and take immediate action toward abolishment -- not as an ideal, but to remove the risk of atomic war amid the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. They commented Tuesday as the city remembered its atomic bombing 79 years ago at the end of World War II. The memorial comes days after Japan and the U.S. reaffirmed Washington's commitment to ""extended deterrence,"" including atomic weapons, to protect its Asian ally. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has vowed to do his utmost to pursue ""realistic and practical measures"" to build global momentum for nuclear disarmament. Critics say it is a hollow promise.

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby has moved menacingly into some of America's most historic Southern cities in what is expected to be a prolonged event of torrential downpours and flooding after slamming into Florida with heavy rain and high winds. Record-setting rain from the storm that killed at least five people on Monday was causing flash flooding in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Savannah Mayor Van Johnson told residents Monday night to hunker down and expect a rough day on Tuesday. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida Monday as a Category 1 hurricane.

Bangladesh protesters want Nobel Peace Prize laureate Yunus to lead country after Hasina's departure

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- A key organizer of Bangladesh's student protests says Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is their choice as head of an interim government a day after the longtime Prime Minister Sheik Hasina resigned. The country's figurehead president and the military chief said Monday that an interim government would be formed soon. Nahid Islam, the organizer, in a video post in social media said Tuesday the student protest leaders have already talked with Yunus, who consented to take over. Islam said the student protesters would announce more names for the government, and it would be a difficult challenge for the current leadership to ignore their choices.

Japan's share benchmark soars nearly 11% a day after massive sell-offs that shook Wall Street

NEW YORK (AP) -- Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index has soared more than 10% a day after it set markets tumbling in Europe and on Wall Street, while other world markets appeared to have settled after the rollercoaster ride that started the week. The Japanese index fell back after its biggest early advance, gaining 8.7% by midmorning on Tuesday. On Monday, nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as world markets quaked under fears the U.S. economy is slowing too much. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed the Nikkei's 12.4% plunge, its worst since 1987.

Proxy forces armed by Iran could take part in retaliation against Israel over Hamas leader's killing

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- As Iran threatens to respond to the suspected Israeli assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, the regional militias that the Islamic Republic has armed for decades could play a role in any attack. They include Lebanon's Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels of Yemen, Shiite militias in Iraq and others. Those relationships are managed by Iran's powerful paramilitary organization, the Revolutionary Guard. Iran relies on those proxy forces as international sanctions on Tehran, including over its nuclear program, have kept it from receiving advanced weaponry. While developing its own missile program, Iran also relies on militias as an asymmetric threat to squeeze Israel and the United States.

Venezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo ""falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council"" and they openly incited ""police and military officials to disobey the laws.""

Google illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge has ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Witnesses will tell a federal safety board about the blowout on a Boeing 737 Max earlier this year

The National Transportation Safety Board is about to hold a two-day hearing into the blowout of a panel from the side of a Boeing 737 Max airliner. The safety board's hearing starts Tuesday in Washington, D.C. It will hear from witnesses including its own investigators who have been looking into the Jan. 5 accident that occurred during an Alaska Airlines flight. The board is calling it a fact-finding hearing. The NTSB will not vote on a probable cause for the accident. That step probably won't happen for another year or longer after more investigation.

Hiroshima governor says nuclear disarmament must be tackled as a pressing issue, not an ideal

TOKYO (AP) -- Hiroshima officials are urging world leaders to stop relying on nuclear weapons as deterrence and take immediate action toward abolishment -- not as an ideal, but to remove the risk of atomic war amid the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. They commented Tuesday as the city remembered its atomic bombing 79 years ago at the end of World War II. The memorial comes days after Japan and the U.S. reaffirmed Washington's commitment to ""extended deterrence,"" including atomic weapons, to protect its Asian ally. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has vowed to do his utmost to pursue ""realistic and practical measures"" to build global momentum for nuclear disarmament. Critics say it is a hollow promise.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is now official after the Democratic National Committee announced the formal results of the online voting by delegates on Monday night. It caps a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race.

The Latest: Debby blamed for multiple deaths in Florida, Georgia, leaves thousands without power

Tropical storm Debby made landfall as a hurricane in one of the least populated areas of Florida, but it's been blamed for at least four deaths in that state. Another death was reported in Georgia as the storm began lashing that state with potentially devastating rains. Officials say hundreds of people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, and neighboring Manatee County. Debby was expected to slow to a crawl as it turns to the east, and forecasters warn that heavy rain could spawn more flooding in Florida and especially coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Substantial flooding is possible in parts of North Carolina as well.

Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.

2024-08-06,0.051,"Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is now official after the Democratic National Committee announced the formal results of the online voting by delegates on Monday night

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris, a daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history, formally secured the Democratic presidential nomination on Monday -- becoming the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket.

More than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed, Harris' coronation as her party's standard-bearer caps a tumultuous and frenetic period for Democrats prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous June debate performance that shattered his own supporters' confidence in his reelection prospects and spurred extraordinary intraparty warfare about whether he should stay in the race.

Just as soon as Biden abruptly ended his candidacy, Harris and her team worked rapidly to secure backing from the 1,976 party delegates needed to clinch the nomination in a formal roll call vote. She reached that marker at warp speed, with an Associated Press survey of delegates nationwide showing she locked down the necessary commitments a mere 32 hours after Biden's announcement.

Harris' nomination became official after a five-day round of online balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates ended Monday night, with the party saying in a statement released just before midnight that 99% of delegates casting ballots had done so for Harris. The party had long contemplated the early virtual roll call to ensure Biden would appear on the ballot in every state. It said it would next formally certify the vote before holding a celebratory roll call at the party's convention later this month in Chicago.

An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted after Biden withdrew found 46% of Americans have a favorable view of Harris, while a nearly identical share has an unfavorable view of her. But more Democrats say they are satisfied with her candidacy compared with that of Biden, energizing a party that had long been resigned to the 81-year-old Biden being its nominee against former President Donald Trump, a Republican they view as an existential threat.

Already Harris has telegraphed that she doesn't plan to veer much from the themes and policies that framed Biden's candidacy, such as democracy, gun violence prevention and abortion rights. But her delivery can be far fierier, particularly when she invokes her prosecutorial background to lambast Trump and his 34 felony convictions for falsifying business records in connection with a hush money scheme.

""Given that unique voice of a new generation, of a prosecutor and a woman when fundamental rights, especially reproductive rights, are on the line, it's almost as if the stars have aligned for her at this moment in history,"" said Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California, who was tapped to succeed Harris in the Senate when she became vice president.

A splash in Washington before a collapse in the 2020 primaries

Kamala Devi Harris was born Oct. 20, 1964, in Oakland, California, to Shyamala Gopalan, a breast cancer scientist who emigrated to the United States from India when she was 19 years old, and Stanford University emeritus professor Donald Harris, a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Jamaica. Her parents' advocacy for civil rights gave her what she described as a ""stroller's-eye view"" of the movement.

She spent years as a prosecutor in the Bay Area before her elevation as the state's attorney general in 2010 and then election as U.S. senator in 2016.

Harris arrived in Washington as a senator at the dawn of the volatile Trump era, quickly establishing herself as a reliable liberal opponent of the new president's personnel and policies and fanning speculation about a presidential bid of her own. Securing a spot on the coveted Judiciary Committee gave her a national spotlight to interrogate prominent Trump nominees, such as now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

""I'm not able to be rushed this fast,"" then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions said during a 2017 hearing as Harris repeatedly pressed him on potential conversations with Russian nationals. ""It makes me nervous.""

Harris launched her 2020 presidential campaign with much promise, drawing parallels to former President Barack Obama and attracting more than 20,000 people to a kickoff rally in her hometown. But Harris withdrew from the primary race before the first nominating contest in Iowa, plagued by staff dissent that spilled out into the open and an inability to attract enough campaign cash.

Harris struggled to deliver a consistent pitch to Democratic voters and wobbled on key issues such as health care. She suggested she backed eliminating private insurance for a full government-run system -- ""Medicare for All"" coverage -- before releasing her own health care plan that preserved private insurance. Now, during her nascent general election campaign, Harris has already reversed some of her earlier, more liberal positions, such as a ban on fracking that she endorsed in 2019.

And while Harris tried to deploy her law enforcement background as an asset in her 2020 presidential campaign, it never attracted enough support in a party that couldn't reconcile some of her past tough-on-crime positions at a time of heightened focus on police brutality.

Joining Biden's team -- and an evolution as vice president

Still, Harris was at the top of the vice presidential shortlist when Biden was pondering his running mate, after his pledge in early 2020 that he would choose a Black woman as his No. 2. He was fond of Harris, who had forged a close friendship with his now-deceased son Beau, who had been Delaware's attorney general when she was in that job for California.

Her first months as vice president were far from smooth. Biden asked her to lead the administration's diplomatic efforts with Central America on the root causes of migration to the United States, which triggered attacks from Republicans on border security and remains a political vulnerability. It didn't help matters that Harris stumbled in big interviews, such as in a 2021 sit-down with NBC News' Lester Holt when she responded dismissively that ""I haven't been to Europe"" when the anchor noted that she hadn't visited the U.S.-Mexico border.

For her first two years, Harris also was often tethered to Washington so she could break tie votes in the evenly divided Senate, which gave Democrats landmark wins on the climate and health care but also constrained opportunities for her to travel around the country and meet voters.

Her visibility became far more prominent after the 2022 Supreme Court ruling that dismantled Roe v. Wade, as she became the chief spokesperson for the administration on abortion rights and was a more natural messenger than Biden, a lifelong Catholic who had in the past favored restrictions on the procedure. She is the first vice president to tour an abortion clinic and speaks about reproductive rights in the broader context of maternal health, especially for Black women.

Throughout her vice presidency, Harris has been careful to remain loyal to Biden while emphasizing that she would be ready to step in if needed. That dramatic transition began in late June after the first debate between Biden and Trump, where the president's stumbles were so cataclysmic that he could never reverse the loss of confidence from other Democrats.

Headed to the top of the ticket

After Biden ended his candidacy July 21, he quickly endorsed Harris. And during the first two weeks of her 2024 presidential bid, enthusiasm among the Democratic base surged, with donations pouring in, scores of volunteers showing up at field offices and supporters swelling so much in numbers that event organizers have had to swap venues.

The Harris campaign now believes it has a renewed opportunity to compete in Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia -- states that Biden had started to abandon in favor of shoring up the so-called ""blue wall"" states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

""The country is able to see the Kamala Harris that we all know,"" said Bakari Sellers, who was a national co-chair of her 2020 campaign. ""We really didn't allow the country to see her"" four years ago. Sellers said: ""We had her in bubble wrap. What people are seeing now is that she's real, she's talented.""

Yet Democrats are anticipating that Harris' political honeymoon will wear off, and she is inevitably going to come under tougher scrutiny for Biden administration positions, the state of the economy and volatile situations abroad, particularly in the Middle East. Harris has also yet to answer extended questions from journalists nor sit down for a formal interview since she began her run.

The Trump campaign has been eager to define Harris as she continues to introduce herself to voters nationwide, releasing an ad blaming her for the high number of illegal crossings at the southern border during the Biden administration and dubbing her ""Failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal.""

The Republican nominee's supporters have also derisively branded Harris as a diversity hire, while Trump himself has engaged in ugly racial attacks of his own, wrongly asserting that Harris had in the past only promoted her Indian heritage and only recently played up her Black identity.

His remarks are previewing a season of racist and sexist claims against the person who would be the first woman and the first person of South Asian heritage in the presidency.

""I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black,"" Trump said while addressing the annual convention of the National Association of Black Journalists. ""So, I don't know, is she Indian or is she Black?""

In her response, Harris called it ""the same old show -- the divisiveness and the disrespect"" and said voters ""deserve better.""

""The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth, a leader who does not respond with hostility and anger when confronted with the facts,"" Harris said at a Sigma Gamma Rho sorority gathering in Houston. ""We deserve a leader who understands that our differences do not divide us.""

The UN Acknowledges Foundation for a Drug-Free World With Consultative Status"
2024-08-06,-0.4431,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nancy Pelosi thought briefly she might have died on Jan. 6, 2021 .

Not quite two years later, the threat of political violence would come for her husband at their home .

""Where's Nancy? Where's Nancy?""

That was the chilling question the intruder posed to Paul Pelosi before bludgeoning the then-82-year-old over the head with a hammer in their San Francisco house. It echoed the menacing jeers of the rioters roaming the halls of the Capitol calling out ""Nancy, Nancy"" on Jan. 6.

The through line of escalating political rhetoric and violence in American public life serves as the opening and closing message of Pelosi's new book, ""The Art of Power, My Story as America's First Woman Speaker of the House.""

Pelosi recounts her nearly four-decade legislative record in Congress but also allows a rare public glimpse into the private devastation around the assault on her husband. With it, she delivers a grave warning that the casual mockery and mimicry of political violence in America is chasing a generation from public service.

""The current climate of threats and attacks must stop,"" Pelosi writes.

""We cannot ask people to serve in public life if the cost is risking the safety of their families and those they love.""

Pelosi's book pages through familiar terrain for those who have followed the 84-year-old's career, rising from ""housewife to House member to House speaker."" The steely California Democrat, the speaker emerita, is no longer in leadership but running for reelection to the House this fall.

She twice won the speakers gavel, worked alongside seven presidents and, more recently, played a pivotal role in quietly convincing President Joe Biden to reassess his decision to remain in the 2024 presidential election rematch with Republican Donald Trump . Biden bowed out .

But it's the first and final chapters that bring a new element to the Pelosi era, detailing in personal and painstaking ways the toll that America's violent strain is taking on civic life and public service.

""I don't know that we will ever feel safe,"" she writes.

Written well before the July assassination attempt on Trump, Pelosi's assessment of the nation's dangerous discourse arrives after back-to-back congressional shootings of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise and earlier of Democratic former Rep. Gabby Giffords, and it serves as a walk-off warning in what could be among her final years in Congress.

Pelosi recounts her disbelief at being ""pulled off the Speaker's platform"" and out of the House chamber by security the afternoon of Jan. 6 as rioters sent by Trump stormed through the halls, some searching for her.

""I can handle it,"" she protested, telling U.S. Capitol Police she wanted to stay and finish the work as Congress was certifying the 2020 election.

""Their response was curt,"" she writes. ""'No, you can't.'""

After being whisked away to safety at Fort McNair, she writes about huddling with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the three of them desperately calling the Pentagon to send National Guard troops to restore order at the Capitol. She describes House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump loyalist, as almost entirely unseen.

So worried about the rioters' threats against Vice President Mike Pence in hiding at the Capitol, she called and told him, ""Don't let anybody know where you are.""

""It still took three hours from the time I was dragged out of the House chamber for the Guard to arrive at the Capitol complex,"" she writes. ""It took about three and a half hours to clear the rioters from the building.""

Later, surveying the wreckage of broken glass and splintered wood, she was told of blood outside the Speaker's Lobby. In some places, including her office, the mob had ""literally defecated on the floors and rugs,"" she wrote. ""What was left behind was pure destruction.""

She recalled being in war zones, and in Kyiv at the start of the Russian invasion thinking she may well die in Ukraine. ""I briefly thought the same on January 6,"" she wrote.

""When I became Speaker, I knew that I was making myself into a target,"" she writes. ""However, our accepting the risk is something that is fundamentally different for our families.""

Not quite two years later, she was awakened in the middle of the night by the ""Knock. Knock. Knock. Pound, Pound. Pound,"" of the Capitol Police security detail at her door in Washington.

Pelosi recounts the dizzying hours, frantic family phone calls and flight back to San Francisco, the hospital, the surgeries and the long recovery for her husband. Their youngest daughter said he looked like a bandaged-up Frankenstein.

Her son, Paul Jr., went to the family's home to vacuum up the broken glass and clean up the blood. Her daughter Alexandra, who had been a high schooler when Pelosi first ran for Congress, told her, had she known what they were signing up for she would ""never have given you my blessing.""

The attacker was tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. But Pelosi writes, the story of Paul's attack would not go away.

""Our home remains a heartbreaking crime scene,"" she wrote.

Pelosi said her children told her that for a long time Paul would only sleep in the bedroom when she was there. He still suffers from headaches and dizzy spells, and she said she has seen him faint and fall twice from vertigo. As of February, she wrote, she was still changing bandages from surgery on his arm.

But the ""true horror"" she writes was the dehumanizing jokes by Republicans from Trump on down, including the former president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who posted a Paul Pelosi Halloween costume to social media, and the way the crowds would ""laugh, cheer, and applaud"" their cruel remarks.

""It made me profoundly sad for our country,"" she writes.

Pelosi situates the two bloody episodes in the arc of her career, from the way Republicans vilified her in countless campaign ads from the time she first rose as Democratic leader to the way protesters spit on Democrats, including civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, the day the House voted for the Affordable Care Act, to the severed pig's head left outside her family's home in the days before Jan. 6.

Pelosi writes that when she speaks to young people about running for office, ""especially young women, too often I hear their reluctance to put their families in harm's way.""

""This is not the way our country should be -- if you engage in public service, you should not be a target, and your family should not be a target."""

Harris launched her 2020 presidential campaign with much promise, drawing parallels to former President Barack Obama and attracting more than 20,000 people to a kickoff rally in her hometown. But Harris withdrew from the primary race before the first nominating contest in Iowa, plagued by staff dissent that spilled out into the open and an inability to attract enough campaign cash.

Harris struggled to deliver a consistent pitch to Democratic voters and wobbled on key issues such as health care. She suggested she backed eliminating private insurance for a full government-run system -- ""Medicare for All"" coverage -- before releasing her own health care plan that preserved private insurance. Now, during her nascent general election campaign, Harris has already reversed some of her earlier, more liberal positions, such as a ban on fracking that she endorsed in 2019.

And while Harris tried to deploy her law enforcement background as an asset in her 2020 presidential campaign, it never attracted enough support in a party that couldn't reconcile some of her past tough-on-crime positions at a time of heightened focus on police brutality.

Joining Biden's team -- and an evolution as vice president

Still, Harris was at the top of the vice presidential shortlist when Biden was pondering his running mate, after his pledge in early 2020 that he would choose a Black woman as his No. 2. He was fond of Harris, who had forged a close friendship with his now-deceased son Beau, who had been Delaware's attorney general when she was in that job for California.

Her first months as vice president were far from smooth. Biden asked her to lead the administration's diplomatic efforts with Central America on the root causes of migration to the United States, which triggered attacks from Republicans on border security and remains a political vulnerability. It didn't help matters that Harris stumbled in big interviews, such as in a 2021 sit-down with NBC News' Lester Holt when she responded dismissively that ""I haven't been to Europe"" when the anchor noted that she hadn't visited the U.S.-Mexico border.

For her first two years, Harris also was often tethered to Washington so she could break tie votes in the evenly divided Senate, which gave Democrats landmark wins on the climate and health care but also constrained opportunities for her to travel around the country and meet voters.

Her visibility became far more prominent after the 2022 Supreme Court ruling that dismantled Roe v. Wade, as she became the chief spokesperson for the administration on abortion rights and was a more natural messenger than Biden, a lifelong Catholic who had in the past favored restrictions on the procedure. She is the first vice president to tour an abortion clinic and speaks about reproductive rights in the broader context of maternal health, especially for Black women.

Throughout her vice presidency, Harris has been careful to remain loyal to Biden while emphasizing that she would be ready to step in if needed. That dramatic transition began in late June after the first debate between Biden and Trump, where the president's stumbles were so cataclysmic that he could never reverse the loss of confidence from other Democrats.

Headed to the top of the ticket

After Biden ended his candidacy July 21, he quickly endorsed Harris. And during the first two weeks of her 2024 presidential bid, enthusiasm among the Democratic base surged, with donations pouring in, scores of volunteers showing up at field offices and supporters swelling so much in numbers that event organizers have had to swap venues.

The Harris campaign now believes it has a renewed opportunity to compete in Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia -- states that Biden had started to abandon in favor of shoring up the so-called ""blue wall"" states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

""The country is able to see the Kamala Harris that we all know,"" said Bakari Sellers, who was a national co-chair of her 2020 campaign. ""We really didn't allow the country to see her"" four years ago. Sellers said: ""We had her in bubble wrap. What people are seeing now is that she's real, she's talented.""

Yet Democrats are anticipating that Harris' political honeymoon will wear off, and she is inevitably going to come under tougher scrutiny for Biden administration positions, the state of the economy and volatile situations abroad, particularly in the Middle East. Harris has also yet to answer extended questions from journalists nor sit down for a formal interview since she began her run.

The Trump campaign has been eager to define Harris as she continues to introduce herself to voters nationwide, releasing an ad blaming her for the high number of illegal crossings at the southern border during the Biden administration and dubbing her ""Failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal.""

The Republican nominee's supporters have also derisively branded Harris as a diversity hire, while Trump himself has engaged in ugly racial attacks of his own, wrongly asserting that Harris had in the past only promoted her Indian heritage and only recently played up her Black identity.

His remarks are previewing a season of racist and sexist claims against the person who would be the first woman and the first person of South Asian heritage in the presidency.

""I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black,"" Trump said while addressing the annual convention of the National Association of Black Journalists. ""So, I don't know, is she Indian or is she Black?""

In her response, Harris called it ""the same old show -- the divisiveness and the disrespect"" and said voters ""deserve better.""

""The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth, a leader who does not respond with hostility and anger when confronted with the facts,"" Harris said at a Sigma Gamma Rho sorority gathering in Houston. ""We deserve a leader who understands that our differences do not divide us."""

Written well before the July assassination attempt on Trump, Pelosi's assessment of the nation's dangerous discourse arrives after back-to-back congressional shootings of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise and earlier of Democratic former Rep. Gabby Giffords, and it serves as a walk-off warning in what could be among her final years in Congress.

Pelosi recounts her disbelief at being ""pulled off the Speaker's platform"" and out of the House chamber by security the afternoon of Jan. 6 as rioters sent by Trump stormed through the halls, some searching for her.

""I can handle it,"" she protested, telling U.S. Capitol Police she wanted to stay and finish the work as Congress was certifying the 2020 election.

""Their response was curt,"" she writes. ""'No, you can't.'""

After being whisked away to safety at Fort McNair, she writes about huddling with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the three of them desperately calling the Pentagon to send National Guard troops to restore order at the Capitol. She describes House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump loyalist, as almost entirely unseen.

Later, surveying the wreckage of broken glass and splintered wood, she was told of blood outside the Speaker's Lobby. In some places, including her office, the mob had ""literally defecated on the floors and rugs,"" she wrote. ""What was left behind was pure destruction.""

She recalled being in war zones, and in Kyiv at the start of the Russian invasion thinking she may well die in Ukraine. ""I briefly thought the same on January 6,"" she wrote.

""When I became Speaker, I knew that I was making myself into a target,"" she writes. ""However, our accepting the risk is something that is fundamentally different for our families.""

Not quite two years later, she was awakened in the middle of the night by the ""Knock. Knock. Knock. Pound, Pound. Pound,"" of the Capitol Police security detail at her door in Washington.

Pelosi recounts the dizzying hours, frantic family phone calls and flight back to San Francisco, the hospital, the surgeries and the long recovery for her husband. Their youngest daughter said he looked like a bandaged-up Frankenstein.

Her son, Paul Jr., went to the family's home to vacuum up the broken glass and clean up the blood. Her daughter Alexandra, who had been a high schooler when Pelosi first ran for Congress, told her, had she known what they were signing up for she would ""never have given you my blessing.""

The attacker was tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. But Pelosi writes, the story of Paul's attack would not go away.

""Our home remains a heartbreaking crime scene,"" she wrote.

Pelosi said her children told her that for a long time Paul would only sleep in the bedroom when she was there. He still suffers from headaches and dizzy spells, and she said she has seen him faint and fall twice from vertigo. As of February, she wrote, she was still changing bandages from surgery on his arm.

But the ""true horror"" she writes was the dehumanizing jokes by Republicans from Trump on down, including the former president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who posted a Paul Pelosi Halloween costume to social media, and the way the crowds would ""laugh, cheer, and applaud"" their cruel remarks.

""It made me profoundly sad for our country,"" she writes.

Pelosi situates the two bloody episodes in the arc of her career, from the way Republicans vilified her in countless campaign ads from the time she first rose as Democratic leader to the way protesters spit on Democrats, including civil rights leader Rep.

2024-08-06,-0.1765,"Kamala Harris is now Democratic presidential nominee, will face off against Donald Trump this fall

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is now official after the Democratic National Committee announced the formal results of the online voting by delegates on Monday night. It caps a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is a daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.

The Latest: Debby blamed for multiple deaths in Florida, Georgia, leaves thousands without power

Tropical storm Debby made landfall as a hurricane in one of the least populated areas of Florida, but it's been blamed for at least four deaths in that state. Another death was reported in Georgia as the storm began lashing that state with potentially devastating rains. Officials say hundreds of people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, and neighboring Manatee County. Debby was expected to slow to a crawl as it turns to the east, and forecasters warn that heavy rain could spawn more flooding in Florida and especially coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Substantial flooding is possible in parts of North Carolina as well.

Japan's share benchmark soars nearly 11% a day after massive sell-offs that shook Wall Street

NEW YORK (AP) -- Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index has soared more than 10% a day after it set markets tumbling in Europe and on Wall Street, while other world markets appeared to have settled after the rollercoaster ride that started the week. The Japanese index fell back after its biggest early advance, gaining 8.7% by midmorning. On Monday, nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as world markets quaked under fears the U.S. economy is slowing too much. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed the Nikkei's 12.4% plunge, its worst since 1987.

Google illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge has ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Proxy forces armed by Iran could take part in retaliation against Israel over Hamas leader's killing

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- As Iran threatens to respond to the suspected Israeli assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, the regional militias that the Islamic Republic has armed for decades could play a role in any attack. They include Lebanon's Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels of Yemen, Shiite militias in Iraq and others. Those relationships are managed by Iran's powerful paramilitary organization, the Revolutionary Guard. Iran relies on those proxy forces as international sanctions on Tehran, including over its nuclear program, have kept it from receiving advanced weaponry. While developing its own missile program, Iran also relies on militias as an asymmetric threat to squeeze Israel and the United States.

Venezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo ""falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council"" and they openly incited ""police and military officials to disobey the laws.""

Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.

Hiroshima governor says nuclear disarmament must be tackled as a pressing issue, not an ideal

TOKYO (AP) -- Hiroshima officials are urging world leaders to stop relying on nuclear weapons as deterrence and take immediate action toward abolishment -- not as an ideal, but to remove the risk of atomic war amid the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. They commented Tuesday as the city remembered its atomic bombing 79 years ago at the end of World War II. The memorial comes days after Japan and the U.S. reaffirmed Washington's commitment to ""extended deterrence,"" including atomic weapons, to protect its Asian ally. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has vowed to do his utmost to pursue ""realistic and practical measures"" to build global momentum for nuclear disarmament. Critics say it is a hollow promise.

LYON, France (AP) -- Jean-Philippe Mateta scored twice as France advanced to the final of the men's soccer tournament at the Paris Olympics with a 3-1 win over Egypt after extra time. France will play Spain in Friday's final at Parc des Princes in a match that will ensure a first European gold medalist for 32 years.

Slow-moving Tropical Storm Debby bringing torrential rains, major flood threat to southeastern US

HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby has moved menacingly into some of America's most historic Southern cities in what is expected to be a prolonged event of torrential downpours and flooding after slamming into Florida with heavy rain and high winds. Record-setting rain from the storm that killed at least five people on Monday was causing flash flooding in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Savannah Mayor Van Johnson told residents Monday night to hunker down and expect a rough day on Tuesday. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida Monday as a Category 1 hurricane.

Japan's share benchmark soars nearly 11% a day after massive sell-offs that shook Wall Street

NEW YORK (AP) -- Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index has soared more than 10% a day after it set markets tumbling in Europe and on Wall Street, while other world markets appeared to have settled after the rollercoaster ride that started the week. The Japanese index fell back after its biggest early advance, gaining 8.7% by midmorning. On Monday, nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as world markets quaked under fears the U.S. economy is slowing too much. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed the Nikkei's 12.4% plunge, its worst since 1987.

Google illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge has ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Proxy forces armed by Iran could take part in retaliation against Israel over Hamas leader's killing

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- As Iran threatens to respond to the suspected Israeli assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, the regional militias that the Islamic Republic has armed for decades could play a role in any attack. They include Lebanon's Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels of Yemen, Shiite militias in Iraq and others. Those relationships are managed by Iran's powerful paramilitary organization, the Revolutionary Guard. Iran relies on those proxy forces as international sanctions on Tehran, including over its nuclear program, have kept it from receiving advanced weaponry. While developing its own missile program, Iran also relies on militias as an asymmetric threat to squeeze Israel and the United States.

Venezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo ""falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council"" and they openly incited ""police and military officials to disobey the laws.""

Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.

Hiroshima governor says nuclear disarmament must be tackled as a pressing issue, not an ideal

TOKYO (AP) -- Hiroshima officials are urging world leaders to stop relying on nuclear weapons as deterrence and take immediate action toward abolishment -- not as an ideal, but to remove the risk of atomic war amid the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. They commented Tuesday as the city remembered its atomic bombing 79 years ago at the end of World War II. The memorial comes days after Japan and the U.S. reaffirmed Washington's commitment to ""extended deterrence,"" including atomic weapons, to protect its Asian ally. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has vowed to do his utmost to pursue ""realistic and practical measures"" to build global momentum for nuclear disarmament. Critics say it is a hollow promise.

2024-08-06,-0.2157,"Kamala Harris is now Democratic presidential nominee, will face off against Donald Trump this fall

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is now official after the Democratic National Committee announced the formal results of the online voting by delegates on Monday night. It caps a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is a daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.

The Latest: Debby blamed for multiple deaths in Florida, Georgia, leaves thousands without power

Tropical storm Debby made landfall as a hurricane in one of the least populated areas of Florida, but it's been blamed for at least four deaths in that state. Another death was reported in Georgia as the storm began lashing that state with potentially devastating rains. Officials say hundreds of people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, and neighboring Manatee County. Debby was expected to slow to a crawl as it turns to the east, and forecasters warn that heavy rain could spawn more flooding in Florida and especially coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Substantial flooding is possible in parts of North Carolina as well.

2024-08-06,-0.4431,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nancy Pelosi thought briefly she might have died on Jan. 6, 2021.

Not quite two years later, the threat of political violence would come for her husband at their home.

""Where's Nancy? Where's Nancy?""

That was the chilling question the intruder posed to Paul Pelosi before bludgeoning the then-82-year-old over the head with a hammer in their San Francisco house. It echoed the menacing jeers of the rioters roaming the halls of the Capitol calling out ""Nancy, Nancy"" on Jan. 6.

The through line of escalating political rhetoric and violence in American public life serves as the opening and closing message of Pelosi's new book, ""The Art of Power, My Story as America's First Woman Speaker of the House.""

Pelosi recounts her nearly four-decade legislative record in Congress but also allows a rare public glimpse into the private devastation around the assault on her husband. With it, she delivers a grave warning that the casual mockery and mimicry of political violence in America is chasing a generation from public service.

""The current climate of threats and attacks must stop,"" Pelosi writes.

""We cannot ask people to serve in public life if the cost is risking the safety of their families and those they love.""

Pelosi's book pages through familiar terrain for those who have followed the 84-year-old's career, rising from ""housewife to House member to House speaker."" The steely California Democrat, the speaker emerita, is no longer in leadership but running for reelection to the House this fall.

She twice won the speakers gavel, worked alongside seven presidents and, more recently, played a pivotal role in quietly convincing President Joe Biden to reassess his decision to remain in the 2024 presidential election rematch with Republican Donald Trump. Biden bowed out.

But it's the first and final chapters that bring a new element to the Pelosi era, detailing in personal and painstaking ways the toll that America's violent strain is taking on civic life and public service.

""I don't know that we will ever feel safe,"" she writes.

Written well before the July assassination attempt on Trump, Pelosi's assessment of the nation's dangerous discourse arrives after back-to-back congressional shootings of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise and earlier of Democratic former Rep. Gabby Giffords, and it serves as a walk-off warning in what could be among her final years in Congress.

Pelosi recounts her disbelief at being ""pulled off the Speaker's platform"" and out of the House chamber by security the afternoon of Jan. 6 as rioters sent by Trump stormed through the halls, some searching for her.

""I can handle it,"" she protested, telling U.S. Capitol Police she wanted to stay and finish the work as Congress was certifying the 2020 election.

""Their response was curt,"" she writes. ""'No, you can't.'""

After being whisked away to safety at Fort McNair, she writes about huddling with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the three of them desperately calling the Pentagon to send National Guard troops to restore order at the Capitol. She describes House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump loyalist, as almost entirely unseen.

So worried about the rioters' threats against Vice President Mike Pence in hiding at the Capitol, she called and told him, ""Don't let anybody know where you are.""

""It still took three hours from the time I was dragged out of the House chamber for the Guard to arrive at the Capitol complex,"" she writes. ""It took about three and a half hours to clear the rioters from the building.""

Later, surveying the wreckage of broken glass and splintered wood, she was told of blood outside the Speaker's Lobby. In some places, including her office, the mob had ""literally defecated on the floors and rugs,"" she wrote. ""What was left behind was pure destruction.""

She recalled being in war zones, and in Kyiv at the start of the Russian invasion thinking she may well die in Ukraine. ""I briefly thought the same on January 6,"" she wrote.

""When I became Speaker, I knew that I was making myself into a target,"" she writes. ""However, our accepting the risk is something that is fundamentally different for our families.""

Not quite two years later, she was awakened in the middle of the night by the ""Knock. Knock. Knock. Pound, Pound. Pound,"" of the Capitol Police security detail at her door in Washington.

""The officers' expressions were grim,"" she writes.

""It's Mr. Pelosi. He's been attacked in your home.""

""Is he okay?""

""We don't know.""

""Is he alive?""

""We don't know.""

Pelosi recounts the dizzying hours, frantic family phone calls and flight back to San Francisco, the hospital, the surgeries and the long recovery for her husband. Their youngest daughter said he looked like a bandaged-up Frankenstein.

Her son, Paul Jr., went to the family's home to vacuum up the broken glass and clean up the blood. Her daughter Alexandra, who had been a high schooler when Pelosi first ran for Congress, told her, had she known what they were signing up for she would ""never have given you my blessing.""

The attacker was tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. But Pelosi writes, the story of Paul's attack would not go away.

""Our home remains a heartbreaking crime scene,"" she wrote.

Pelosi said her children told her that for a long time Paul would only sleep in the bedroom when she was there. He still suffers from headaches and dizzy spells, and she said she has seen him faint and fall twice from vertigo. As of February, she wrote, she was still changing bandages from surgery on his arm.

But the ""true horror"" she writes was the dehumanizing jokes by Republicans from Trump on down, including the former president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who posted a Paul Pelosi Halloween costume to social media, and the way the crowds would ""laugh, cheer, and applaud"" their cruel remarks.

""It made me profoundly sad for our country,"" she writes.

Pelosi situates the two bloody episodes in the arc of her career, from the way Republicans vilified her in countless campaign ads from the time she first rose as Democratic leader to the way protesters spit on Democrats, including civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, the day the House voted for the Affordable Care Act, to the severed pig's head left outside her family's home in the days before Jan. 6.

Pelosi writes that when she speaks to young people about running for office, ""especially young women, too often I hear their reluctance to put their families in harm's way.""

""This is not the way our country should be -- if you engage in public service, you should not be a target, and your family should not be a target."""

""I don't know that we will ever feel safe,"" she writes.

Written well before the July assassination attempt on Trump, Pelosi's assessment of the nation's dangerous discourse arrives after back-to-back congressional shootings of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise and earlier of Democratic former Rep. Gabby Giffords, and it serves as a walk-off warning in what could be among her final years in Congress.

Pelosi recounts her disbelief at being ""pulled off the Speaker's platform"" and out of the House chamber by security the afternoon of Jan. 6 as rioters sent by Trump stormed through the halls, some searching for her.

""I can handle it,"" she protested, telling U.S. Capitol Police she wanted to stay and finish the work as Congress was certifying the 2020 election.

""Their response was curt,"" she writes. ""'No, you can't.'""

After being whisked away to safety at Fort McNair, she writes about huddling with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the three of them desperately calling the Pentagon to send National Guard troops to restore order at the Capitol. She describes House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump loyalist, as almost entirely unseen.

So worried about the rioters' threats against Vice President Mike Pence in hiding at the Capitol, she called and told him, ""Don't let anybody know where you are.""

""It still took three hours from the time I was dragged out of the House chamber for the Guard to arrive at the Capitol complex,"" she writes. ""It took about three and a half hours to clear the rioters from the building.""

Later, surveying the wreckage of broken glass and splintered wood, she was told of blood outside the Speaker's Lobby. In some places, including her office, the mob had ""literally defecated on the floors and rugs,"" she wrote. ""What was left behind was pure destruction.""

She recalled being in war zones, and in Kyiv at the start of the Russian invasion thinking she may well die in Ukraine. ""I briefly thought the same on January 6,"" she wrote.

""When I became Speaker, I knew that I was making myself into a target,"" she writes. ""However, our accepting the risk is something that is fundamentally different for our families.""

Not quite two years later, she was awakened in the middle of the night by the ""Knock. Knock. Knock. Pound, Pound. Pound,"" of the Capitol Police security detail at her door in Washington.

Pelosi recounts the dizzying hours, frantic family phone calls and flight back to San Francisco, the hospital, the surgeries and the long recovery for her husband. Their youngest daughter said he looked like a bandaged-up Frankenstein.

Her son, Paul Jr., went to the family's home to vacuum up the broken glass and clean up the blood. Her daughter Alexandra, who had been a high schooler when Pelosi first ran for Congress, told her, had she known what they were signing up for she would ""never have given you my blessing.""

The attacker was tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. But Pelosi writes, the story of Paul's attack would not go away.

""Our home remains a heartbreaking crime scene,"" she wrote.

Pelosi said her children told her that for a long time Paul would only sleep in the bedroom when she was there. He still suffers from headaches and dizzy spells, and she said she has seen him faint and fall twice from vertigo. As of February, she wrote, she was still changing bandages from surgery on his arm.

But the ""true horror"" she writes was the dehumanizing jokes by Republicans from Trump on down, including the former president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who posted a Paul Pelosi Halloween costume to social media, and the way the crowds would ""laugh, cheer, and applaud"" their cruel remarks.

""It made me profoundly sad for our country,"" she writes.

Pelosi situates the two bloody episodes in the arc of her career, from the way Republicans vilified her in countless campaign ads from the time she first rose as Democratic leader to the way protesters spit on Democrats, including civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, the day the House voted for the Affordable Care Act, to the severed pig's head left outside her family's home in the days before Jan. 6.

Pelosi writes that when she speaks to young people about running for office, ""especially young women, too often I hear their reluctance to put their families in harm's way.""

""This is not the way our country should be -- if you engage in public service, you should not be a target, and your family should not be a target."""

Pelosi recounts the dizzying hours, frantic family phone calls and flight back to San Francisco, the hospital, the surgeries and the long recovery for her husband. Their youngest daughter said he looked like a bandaged-up Frankenstein.

Her son, Paul Jr., went to the family's home to vacuum up the broken glass and clean up the blood. Her daughter Alexandra, who had been a high schooler when Pelosi first ran for Congress, told her, had she known what they were signing up for she would ""never have given you my blessing.""

The attacker was tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. But Pelosi writes, the story of Paul's attack would not go away.

""Our home remains a heartbreaking crime scene,"" she wrote.

Pelosi said her children told her that for a long time Paul would only sleep in the bedroom when she was there. He still suffers from headaches and dizzy spells, and she said she has seen him faint and fall twice from vertigo. As of February, she wrote, she was still changing bandages from surgery on his arm.

But the ""true horror"" she writes was the dehumanizing jokes by Republicans from Trump on down, including the former president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who posted a Paul Pelosi Halloween costume to social media, and the way the crowds would ""laugh, cheer, and applaud"" their cruel remarks.

""It made me profoundly sad for our country,"" she writes.

Pelosi situates the two bloody episodes in the arc of her career, from the way Republicans vilified her in countless campaign ads from the time she first rose as Democratic leader to the way protesters spit on Democrats, including civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, the day the House voted for the Affordable Care Act, to the severed pig's head left outside her family's home in the days before Jan. 6.

""Where's Nancy? Where's Nancy?""

That was the chilling question the intruder posed to Paul Pelosi before bludgeoning the then-82-year-old over the head with a hammer in their San Francisco house. It echoed the menacing jeers of the rioters roaming the halls of the Capitol calling out ""Nancy, Nancy"" on Jan. 6.

The through line of escalating political rhetoric and violence in American public life serves as the opening and closing message of Pelosi's new book, ""The Art of Power, My Story as America's First Woman Speaker of the House.""

Pelosi recounts her nearly four-decade legislative record in Congress but also allows a rare public glimpse into the private devastation around the assault on her husband. With it, she delivers a grave warning that the casual mockery and mimicry of political violence in America is chasing a generation from public service.

She twice won the speakers gavel, worked alongside seven presidents and, more recently, played a pivotal role in quietly convincing President Joe Biden to reassess his decision to remain in the 2024 presidential election rematch with Republican Donald Trump. Biden bowed out.

Written well before the July assassination attempt on Trump, Pelosi's assessment of the nation's dangerous discourse arrives after back-to-back congressional shootings of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise and earlier of Democratic former Rep. Gabby Giffords, and it serves as a walk-off warning in what could be among her final years in Congress.

Pelosi recounts her disbelief at being ""pulled off the Speaker's platform"" and out of the House chamber by security the afternoon of Jan. 6 as rioters sent by Trump stormed through the halls, some searching for her.

""I can handle it,"" she protested, telling U.S. Capitol Police she wanted to stay and finish the work as Congress was certifying the 2020 election.

""Their response was curt,"" she writes. ""'No, you can't.'""

After being whisked away to safety at Fort McNair, she writes about huddling with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the three of them desperately calling the Pentagon to send National Guard troops to restore order at the Capitol. She describes House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump loyalist, as almost entirely unseen.

So worried about the rioters' threats against Vice President Mike Pence in hiding at the Capitol, she called and told him, ""Don't let anybody know where you are.""

""It still took three hours from the time I was dragged out of the House chamber for the Guard to arrive at the Capitol complex,"" she writes. ""It took about three and a half hours to clear the rioters from the building.""

Later, surveying the wreckage of broken glass and splintered wood, she was told of blood outside the Speaker's Lobby. In some places, including her office, the mob had ""literally defecated on the floors and rugs,"" she wrote. ""What was left behind was pure destruction.""

She recalled being in war zones, and in Kyiv at the start of the Russian invasion thinking she may well die in Ukraine. ""I briefly thought the same on January 6,"" she wrote.

2024-08-06,-0.4431,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nancy Pelosi thought briefly she might have died on Jan. 6, 2021.

Not quite two years later, the threat of political violence would come for her husband at their home.

""Where's Nancy? Where's Nancy?""

That was the chilling question the intruder posed to Paul Pelosi before bludgeoning the then-82-year-old over the head with a hammer in their San Francisco house. It echoed the menacing jeers of the rioters roaming the halls of the Capitol calling out ""Nancy, Nancy"" on Jan. 6.

The through line of escalating political rhetoric and violence in American public life serves as the opening and closing message of Pelosi's new book, ""The Art of Power, My Story as America's First Woman Speaker of the House.""

Pelosi recounts her nearly four-decade legislative record in Congress but also allows a rare public glimpse into the private devastation around the assault on her husband. With it, she delivers a grave warning that the casual mockery and mimicry of political violence in America is chasing a generation from public service.

""The current climate of threats and attacks must stop,"" Pelosi writes.

""We cannot ask people to serve in public life if the cost is risking the safety of their families and those they love.""

Pelosi's book pages through familiar terrain for those who have followed the 84-year-old's career, rising from ""housewife to House member to House speaker."" The steely California Democrat, the speaker emerita, is no longer in leadership but running for reelection to the House this fall.

She twice won the speakers gavel, worked alongside seven presidents and, more recently, played a pivotal role in quietly convincing President Joe Biden to reassess his decision to remain in the 2024 presidential election rematch with Republican Donald Trump. Biden bowed out.

But it's the first and final chapters that bring a new element to the Pelosi era, detailing in personal and painstaking ways the toll that America's violent strain is taking on civic life and public service.

""I don't know that we will ever feel safe,"" she writes.

Written well before the July assassination attempt on Trump, Pelosi's assessment of the nation's dangerous discourse arrives after back-to-back congressional shootings of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise and earlier of Democratic former Rep. Gabby Giffords, and it serves as a walk-off warning in what could be among her final years in Congress.

Pelosi recounts her disbelief at being ""pulled off the Speaker's platform"" and out of the House chamber by security the afternoon of Jan. 6 as rioters sent by Trump stormed through the halls, some searching for her.

""I can handle it,"" she protested, telling U.S. Capitol Police she wanted to stay and finish the work as Congress was certifying the 2020 election.

""Their response was curt,"" she writes. ""'No, you can't.'""

After being whisked away to safety at Fort McNair, she writes about huddling with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the three of them desperately calling the Pentagon to send National Guard troops to restore order at the Capitol. She describes House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump loyalist, as almost entirely unseen.

So worried about the rioters' threats against Vice President Mike Pence in hiding at the Capitol, she called and told him, ""Don't let anybody know where you are.""

""It still took three hours from the time I was dragged out of the House chamber for the Guard to arrive at the Capitol complex,"" she writes. ""It took about three and a half hours to clear the rioters from the building.""

Later, surveying the wreckage of broken glass and splintered wood, she was told of blood outside the Speaker's Lobby. In some places, including her office, the mob had ""literally defecated on the floors and rugs,"" she wrote. ""What was left behind was pure destruction.""

She recalled being in war zones, and in Kyiv at the start of the Russian invasion thinking she may well die in Ukraine. ""I briefly thought the same on January 6,"" she wrote.

""When I became Speaker, I knew that I was making myself into a target,"" she writes. ""However, our accepting the risk is something that is fundamentally different for our families.""

Not quite two years later, she was awakened in the middle of the night by the ""Knock. Knock. Knock. Pound, Pound. Pound,"" of the Capitol Police security detail at her door in Washington.

""The officers' expressions were grim,"" she writes.

""It's Mr. Pelosi. He's been attacked in your home.""

""Is he okay?""

""We don't know.""

""Is he alive?""

""We don't know.""

Pelosi recounts the dizzying hours, frantic family phone calls and flight back to San Francisco, the hospital, the surgeries and the long recovery for her husband. Their youngest daughter said he looked like a bandaged-up Frankenstein.

Her son, Paul Jr., went to the family's home to vacuum up the broken glass and clean up the blood. Her daughter Alexandra, who had been a high schooler when Pelosi first ran for Congress, told her, had she known what they were signing up for she would ""never have given you my blessing.""

The attacker was tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. But Pelosi writes, the story of Paul's attack would not go away.

""Our home remains a heartbreaking crime scene,"" she wrote.

Pelosi said her children told her that for a long time Paul would only sleep in the bedroom when she was there. He still suffers from headaches and dizzy spells, and she said she has seen him faint and fall twice from vertigo. As of February, she wrote, she was still changing bandages from surgery on his arm.

But the ""true horror"" she writes was the dehumanizing jokes by Republicans from Trump on down, including the former president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who posted a Paul Pelosi Halloween costume to social media, and the way the crowds would ""laugh, cheer, and applaud"" their cruel remarks.

""It made me profoundly sad for our country,"" she writes.

Pelosi situates the two bloody episodes in the arc of her career, from the way Republicans vilified her in countless campaign ads from the time she first rose as Democratic leader to the way protesters spit on Democrats, including civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, the day the House voted for the Affordable Care Act, to the severed pig's head left outside her family's home in the days before Jan. 6.

Pelosi writes that when she speaks to young people about running for office, ""especially young women, too often I hear their reluctance to put their families in harm's way.""

Steve Scalise and earlier of Democratic former Rep. Gabby Giffords, and it serves as a walk-off warning in what could be among her final years in Congress.

Pelosi recounts her disbelief at being ""pulled off the Speaker's platform"" and out of the House chamber by security the afternoon of Jan. 6 as rioters sent by Trump stormed through the halls, some searching for her.

""I can handle it,"" she protested, telling U.S. Capitol Police she wanted to stay and finish the work as Congress was certifying the 2020 election.

""Their response was curt,"" she writes. ""'No, you can't.'""

After being whisked away to safety at Fort McNair, she writes about huddling with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the three of them desperately calling the Pentagon to send National Guard troops to restore order at the Capitol. She describes House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump loyalist, as almost entirely unseen.

So worried about the rioters' threats against Vice President Mike Pence in hiding at the Capitol, she called and told him, ""Don't let anybody know where you are.""

""It still took three hours from the time I was dragged out of the House chamber for the Guard to arrive at the Capitol complex,"" she writes. ""It took about three and a half hours to clear the rioters from the building.""

Later, surveying the wreckage of broken glass and splintered wood, she was told of blood outside the Speaker's Lobby. In some places, including her office, the mob had ""literally defecated on the floors and rugs,"" she wrote. ""What was left behind was pure destruction.""

She recalled being in war zones, and in Kyiv at the start of the Russian invasion thinking she may well die in Ukraine. ""I briefly thought the same on January 6,"" she wrote.

""When I became Speaker, I knew that I was making myself into a target,"" she writes. ""However, our accepting the risk is something that is fundamentally different for our families.""

Not quite two years later, she was awakened in the middle of the night by the ""Knock. Knock. Knock. Pound, Pound. Pound,"" of the Capitol Police security detail at her door in Washington.

Pelosi recounts the dizzying hours, frantic family phone calls and flight back to San Francisco, the hospital, the surgeries and the long recovery for her husband. Their youngest daughter said he looked like a bandaged-up Frankenstein.

Her son, Paul Jr., went to the family's home to vacuum up the broken glass and clean up the blood. Her daughter Alexandra, who had been a high schooler when Pelosi first ran for Congress, told her, had she known what they were signing up for she would ""never have given you my blessing.""

The attacker was tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. But Pelosi writes, the story of Paul's attack would not go away.

""Our home remains a heartbreaking crime scene,"" she wrote.

Pelosi said her children told her that for a long time Paul would only sleep in the bedroom when she was there. He still suffers from headaches and dizzy spells, and she said she has seen him faint and fall twice from vertigo. As of February, she wrote, she was still changing bandages from surgery on his arm.

But the ""true horror"" she writes was the dehumanizing jokes by Republicans from Trump on down, including the former president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who posted a Paul Pelosi Halloween costume to social media, and the way the crowds would ""laugh, cheer, and applaud"" their cruel remarks.

""It made me profoundly sad for our country,"" she writes.

Pelosi situates the two bloody episodes in the arc of her career, from the way Republicans vilified her in countless campaign ads from the time she first rose as Democratic leader to the way protesters spit on Democrats, including civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, the day the House voted for the Affordable Care Act, to the severed pig's head left outside her family's home in the days before Jan. 6.

Pelosi writes that when she speaks to young people about running for office, ""especially young women, too often I hear their reluctance to put their families in harm's way.""

""This is not the way our country should be -- if you engage in public service, you should not be a target, and your family should not be a target."""

""Where's Nancy? Where's Nancy?""

That was the chilling question the intruder posed to Paul Pelosi before bludgeoning the then-82-year-old over the head with a hammer in their San Francisco house. It echoed the menacing jeers of the rioters roaming the halls of the Capitol calling out ""Nancy, Nancy"" on Jan. 6.

The through line of escalating political rhetoric and violence in American public life serves as the opening and closing message of Pelosi's new book, ""The Art of Power, My Story as America's First Woman Speaker of the House.""

Pelosi recounts her nearly four-decade legislative record in Congress but also allows a rare public glimpse into the private devastation around the assault on her husband. With it, she delivers a grave warning that the casual mockery and mimicry of political violence in America is chasing a generation from public service.

""The current climate of threats and attacks must stop,"" Pelosi writes.

""We cannot ask people to serve in public life if the cost is risking the safety of their families and those they love.""

Pelosi's book pages through familiar terrain for those who have followed the 84-year-old's career, rising from ""housewife to House member to House speaker."" The steely California Democrat, the speaker emerita, is no longer in leadership but running for reelection to the House this fall.

She twice won the speakers gavel, worked alongside seven presidents and, more recently, played a pivotal role in quietly convincing President Joe Biden to reassess his decision to remain in the 2024 presidential election rematch with Republican Donald Trump. Biden bowed out.

2024-08-06,-0.1216,"Stocks tumbled over fears of a U.S. economic slowdown

A wave of anxiety rippled through financial markets yesterday, and stocks fell around the world as investors zeroed in on signs of a slowing American economy.

The drop extended a sell-off that began on Friday after the U.S. released a job report that showed the highest level of unemployment in nearly three years. That deepened fears that the world's largest economy could be headed for slower growth.

There were other factors at play in the plunge: concerns that tech stocks had run up too far, too fast, and that a strengthening yen could hurt the prospects of Japanese companies and some global traders. In the U.S., some questioned whether the Federal Reserve might have waited too long to cut interest rates. Here's the latest on the market meltdown.

By the numbers: In the U.S., the S&P 500 fell 3 percent, its worst day since September 2022. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index dropped 12.4 percent, its biggest one-day point decline. The FTSE 100, Britain's benchmark index, had its worst day since July 2023, falling just over 2 percent.

Time to sell? It's tough to do nothing during this kind of market turmoil. But in this case, it's your best option, Ron Lieber, our columnist, writes.

A scramble to avoid wider war in the Middle East

Diplomats across the Middle East are working to contain escalating tensions between Israel and Iran as fears of a widening conflict grow in the region after Iran vowed revenge for the killing of a senior Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, on its soil.

The U.S. defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, has ordered more combat aircraft and missile-shooting warships to the Middle East in response to threats to Israel from Iran and its proxies, and President Biden convened his national security team to discuss developments in the region and spoke with King Abdullah II of Jordan, according to a White House statement.

Foreign ministers from Islamic countries are to gather in Saudi Arabia tomorrow for an ""extraordinary"" meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation that was called to discuss ""the continued crimes of the Israeli occupation against the Palestinian people,"" including Haniyeh's killing, the organization said in a statement.

Quotable: ""We must be prepared for anything -- including a swift transition to offense,"" said Yoav Gallant, Israel's defense minister.

In Lebanon: Hezbollah and Israel continued to trade cross-border fire, with an Israeli airstrike killing two people in southern Lebanon, according to Lebanon's Ministry of Health.

In Israel: A quarrel between Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over Israel's approach to cease-fire talks mirrors growing domestic tensions.

🇺🇸 2024

The presidential election is less than 100 days away. Here's the latest from the campaign trail.

Harris is poised to announce her running mate

The campaign to be Kamala Harris's running mate is reaching its last hours. The final stage has reached something of an ugly phase, sowing divisions within the party as donors, interest groups and political rivals lobby for their preferred candidates.

Three contenders -- Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona and Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota -- met with the vice president in Washington on Sunday. After announcing her pick, Harris plans to hold a first rally with her new running mate in Philadelphia today.

Here's what else to know:

The elevation of Harris to the top of the Democratic ticket has transformed what had been a long slog into a fast-moving campaign. Analysts said that the timeline was likely to benefit Harris.

In a live interview with Adin Ross, a 23-year-old internet streamer, Donald Trump appeared to blame immigrants for the drop in global stock markets.

In a new book, Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker, said that her push for President Biden to withdraw had come down to one factor: the need to defeat Donald Trump.

2024-08-06,0.2784,"Naomi Fryers examines what Kamala Harris and a sizeable portion of the internet have in common -- and concludes it's a connection to Johnny Farnham.

IN SEPTEMBER of 2022, this writer was fortunate enough to pen a tribute piece to John Farnham amidst his shocking cancer diagnoses. Reflecting on his great achievements, musical hero status and what he meant to ordinary people, it willed him a strong recovery.

Such was the timing and popularity of the man himself that some 75,000 strong readers took in the content, later ranked as IA's article of the year. When the legendary figure's iconic musical melody later featured in the ""Yes"" campaign just prior to Australia's Voice Referendum last year, a follow-up piece was written about how the superstar represented a voice for change.

Somewhat optimistically, that opinion editorial welcomed the transition home amidst a stir of ""beat up"" controversy about turning an iconic party anthem into part of a larger political movement. Despite the Referendum failing to come to fruition, the advertisement proved hugely popular -- and rightfully so. Then on Thursday, as Australia woke, Johnny was back -- but this time on the world stage.

One glance at the morning socials was enough to tell you he had done it again. His iconic 'You're the Voice' anthem was up and about and trending again -- just one more, ""last"" time. A new craftily designed viral music video clip was doing the rounds. Opening with unfavourable Trumpisms, the clip made a strong political statement.

It depicted the need for the American Democratic Party to pass on the torch of change from President Joe Biden to Vice President Kamala Harris, for a generation of progressive and diverse leaders to ultimately gift the people hope for a better future. Perhaps one could presume with a bit more senility than the first two presidential contenders, from times long past.

One would then hopefully be free from fear of the little things. Like risking an all-out nuclear world war through a lack of basic diplomacy. Then, overnight, an armchair hacktivist and musical sentimentalist's dream conspired to come true. One could feel the full force of this rumbling excitement in their nerdish but democratic ""old school"" musical loins. Finally! Something that may outstrip Gough Whitlam's 'It's Time' jingle of its former glory at the helm of political marketing and pop culture genius.

This new clip appeared punchy and the torch reference was particularly timely, considering many just watched the Olympic ceremony. The masses could, of course, be forgiven for mistakenly believing our main man Johnny was now front, stage and centre in a Democrat-endorsed ad for Kamala Harris' U.S. Presidential Election bid. Although that wasn't the exact reality.

It was, in fact, an unofficial advertisement that for all intent and purposes could well have been mocked up in a loungeroom of an old HP laptop, although Independent Australia cannot confirm such detail. Regardless, it didn't worry the people. For the two-minute and 15-second duration of the video, we reminisced and got caught up in the unification, joy and emotion of the togetherness.

#1 TOP IA STORY OF 2022: John Farnham -- The Voice of Australia

John Farnham was close to death earlier this year and so our top story of 2022 receiving over 75,000 views reflected the depth of affection in our nation for the iconic Australian vocalist. Well done to Naomi Fryers for so brilliantly capturing this love in this moving September piece.

We may as well have been hugging our mates in the pub after some kind of show of lifesaving comradery, for we were all the voice, yet again. It wasn't even initially obvious that the lyrics about not wanting to look at each other down the barrel of the gun were glaringly ironic in the wake of the Trump assassination attempt.

True to form though, the grubby imperialist Poms were quick to try to dust the gloss off this quintessentially momentous Aussie moment by, quite typically, whinging and claiming the singer as theirs -- just like the Ashes and everything else in Australia's longest-living history.

The reason that this advertisement labelled 'outstanding' commenced trending and ultimately went viral was that the music resonated, seemingly as much with a global audience as it did in Australia. Such was its power that it reportedly gave people goosebumps. The fact that it was cleverly constructed unofficially by a trickster likely had no bearing on the good old chain reaction.

The anthem was emotively the best of us and it was seen. With it came the relatable gift of unification, reminiscence and hope. From the likes of Joe Biden to Kamala Harris, to John Farnham himself and X patrons on the old Twittersphere. It brought back the voice -- and not just to Australia. This time the world responded and who could blame them for wanting more of it?

Naomi Fryers is a writer, author, storyteller and journalist from Melbourne.

2024-08-06,-0.1529,"Lansing -- Widespread change has struck the group of officials whose job is to certify Michigan's elections, igniting concerns about whether the new class is willing to sign off on the results the same way county canvassers in the battleground state did four years ago.

A first-of-its-kind, weeks-long analysis by The Detroit News found 55% of the 332 county canvassers in Michigan were not serving in November 2020 when boards in all 83 counties approved the outcome despite Republican then-President Donald Trump's unsuccessful attempt to overturn his loss to Democrat Joe Biden.

The turnover has been driven by Republicans. While 48% of the Democratic canvassers are new since 2020, 63% -- nearly two out of every three -- are new on the GOP side, according to The News' analysis.

The numbers point to a Michigan Republican Party that's been focused on false claims of widespread fraud aimed at the 2020 election and GOP canvassers who might interfere with the election process this fall, according to Democrats. But Republicans, such as Kalamazoo County canvasser Robert Froman, said the analysis demonstrates an increased and renewed interest in how elections are administered.

""Many people within the framework or the ideology of the Republican Party have realized that they have been sitting in their living rooms way too long, and the country that they know and love is being stolen out from under them,"" Froman said. ""And they're not willing to sit in their living rooms any longer.""

Froman, a 72-year-old retired postal service employee from Oshtemo Township, is one of the 105 new Republican county canvassers who are serving in 2024 but weren't in their positions in 2020.

Each county in Michigan has a four-person canvassing board, featuring two Republicans and two Democrats, in charge of approving election tallies before they're forwarded to the state for final authorization. The panels rarely get attention and, former Michigan elections director Chris Thomas said, their members often held the posts for many years at a time, making vast changes like what's occurred recently unusual.

Concerns about the 2020 election spurred Froman to get more actively involved in politics, he said. Froman started attending Kalamazoo County Republican Party meetings and volunteering with an entity named Check My Vote, which has been trying to examine and verify addresses used by Michigan residents in the state's official list of registered voters.

Froman, whom Republicans nominated to serve on the Kalamazoo County canvassing board and whose term began last year, said he's personally checked tens of thousands of voters' addresses. He said he ""most definitely"" believes the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.

Asked if he would certify the 2024 presidential election if it unfolded the same way the 2020 one did, Froman replied, ""No. And that's why I'm there.""

Froman is one of four so-called ""county leaders"" or ""trainers"" who have been working with Check My Vote to investigate the state's registered voter list and who have recently gotten county canvassing positions. The others are Bonnie Kellogg in Muskegon County, Maureen Hillary in Clinton County and Ron Palmgren in Genesee County, according to a list of ""county leaders"" in a July 2023 announcement from the Michigan Republican Party.

The belief system that there was widespread fraud in 2020 and a series of attempts to reject results in Michigan over the last four years have some election officials in Michigan expecting that Republicans on some local canvassing boards might try to block the certification process in November if Trump loses to likely Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.

County canvassing boards must have a bipartisan 3-1 or 4-0 vote to certify election results and advance them to the Board of State Canvassers, another panel comprised of two Republicans and two Democrats.

""At this point, shockingly, it wouldn't surprise me to see several counties deadlock,"" said Thomas, who served as Michigan's elections director for more than three decades.

'I do worry'

Each of Michigan's 83 county canvassing boards has the responsibility of reviewing the local vote totals and reporting the results to the Board of State Canvassers, according to a manual published by the Michigan Bureau of Elections.

The county boards, featuring two Republican slots and two Democratic slots, have 14 days following Election Day to certify the results for each of their precincts.

The canvassers serve staggered four-year terms, are nominated by their local political party and are picked, from among the party nominees, by the local board of commissioners. However, there is no official state list that tracks who sits on the key elections boards across Michigan.

The News compiled the names of Michigan's county canvassers -- those serving now and those serving in 2020 -- through questionnaires sent to county clerks in June and July and examining board member lists that were posted on some county websites.

Boards with vacancies are considered by The News to have new members because the positions are expected to be filled before the November election.

Of Michigan's 83 counties, 11 have completely new canvassing boards with four new members from 2020: Alger, Arenac, Clare, Dickinson, Iosco, Mackinac, Manistee, Montmorency, Muskegon, Roscommon and Wayne -- the state's most populous county and the site of a brief November 2020 certification deadlock.

In Iosco County, which is located in northeastern Michigan and has a population of about 25,000, Clerk Nancy Huebel said one past board member died, two resigned for personal reasons, and one, Democrat Patti Casey, wasn't reappointed.

In neighboring Arenac County, Janice Grier, 69, of Standish said Democrats were having trouble finding people to serve on the canvassing board a couple of years ago, so she stepped up. In 2020, 67% of the votes in the county went to Trump.

Grier said she hasn't seen anything that would make her concerned about the county board not certifying the upcoming presidential election, but she's not so certain about elsewhere in Michigan.

""I do worry about other parts of the state,"" Grier said.

Protect the vote?

Over the last four years, there have been three examples of canvassers in Michigan at least initially refusing to certify an election.

Most recently, in the spring, two Republicans on the Delta County canvassing board in the Upper Peninsula voted against certifying a May 7 recall election in which three incumbent Republican county commissioners lost their seats. However, days later, they changed course and approved the results.

""I am doing my best to protect the votes of all citizens of Delta County and to ensure free and fair elections by bringing transparency and reassurance to all Delta County citizens,"" one of the Republican canvassers, Bonnie Hakkola, said at the time.

Hakkola resigned from the board afterward.

The other Republican who initially voted against certification, LeeAnne Oman, was serving as an alternate for an absent GOP canvasser, Sema Deeds.

Jonathan Brater, Michigan's elections director, sent a letter to the Delta County canvassers on May 16, telling them that under the Michigan Constitution and state law, they had ""a clear and nondiscretionary duty to certify election results based solely on election returns.""

""The Constitution and Michigan election law do not authorize boards of county canvassers to refuse to certify election results based on claims made by third parties of alleged election irregularities or a general desire to conduct election investigations,"" Brater wrote in the letter.

In a statement in May, Attorney General Dana Nessel said ""defying the will of the people based on conjecture, dissatisfaction in the results or any other reason not based on Michigan law"" will not be tolerated.

""While the Delta County Board ultimately met their obligations, and as a result have avoided the legal consequences, let this serve as a warning to all of the boards of canvassers across the state that the willful neglect of your duties is a criminal act,"" added Nessel, a Democrat.

Canvassers' role

Asked about the statements from Nessel and Brater about the Delta County canvassers, new Republican Kalamazoo County canvasser Froman said he has a duty to ensure there is a free and fair election.

""I am not going to do anything that's illegal,"" Froman told The News.

Other new canvassers interviewed by The News in recent weeks made similar remarks.

Ron Palmgren, a Republican canvasser in Genesee County, has also served as a county leader for Check My Vote. Asked if the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Trump, Palmgren said he has ""no idea whether it was stolen or not.""

Biden won Michigan's election by 154,000 votes or 3 percentage points, 51%-48%. The outcome has been upheld by audits, a series of court rulings and an investigation by a Republican-controlled state Senate committee.

Palmgren, a 76-year-old retiree from Burton, said he views his role as a canvasser as being an ""impartial arbiter.""

""Based on my experience so far, there is no investigatory process,"" Palmgren said of his responsibilities. ""It is strictly looking at the election results provided by all of the municipalities and making sure that all of the processes that were in place were followed.""

Likewise, Jim Kargol, a 69-year-old from Petoskey who serves on the Emmet County Board of Canvassers, said he doesn't believe there's been fraud in local elections, but he questions what has happened in other places, such as Detroit.

Kargol mentioned a van dropping off loads of ballots in the night during the 2020 presidential election in Detroit, a Democratic stronghold. He appeared to be referencing about 16,000 ballots that had been delivered to the center where absentee ballots were being tallied in Detroit in the early morning hours of Nov. 4. The ballots had been verified by city Clerk Janice Winfrey's staff prior to delivery in a process prescribed by Michigan law, said Thomas, Michigan's former elections director who helped oversee voting in Detroit.

""I really think there was some foolishness that went on,"" said Kargol, a Republican.

Canvassing troubles

After the 2020 presidential election on Nov. 17, 2020, Wayne County's Republican then-canvassers Monica Palmer and William Hartmann questioned precincts in Detroit where the number of ballots cast and the number of votes tracked didn't match and initially voted against certifying the county's results.

But later in the meeting, they changed course and supported certifying the election based on the condition that an audit take place of some precincts within Wayne County.

Minutes after the meeting, Trump and Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel called Palmer and Hartmann, and Trump personally pressured them not to sign the certification document, according to recordings previously reported on by The Detroit News.

""We've got to fight for our country,"" Trump said during the phone call, according to the recordings. ""We can't let these people take our country away from us.""

More: Trump recorded pressuring Wayne County canvassers not to certify 2020 vote

The Michigan Bureau of Elections determined the vote that occurred and the signatures of the chair or vice chair of the four-member canvassing board and the county clerk were the only things necessary to advance the certification to the Board of State Canvassers.

Hartmann died in 2021, and Republican Party officials didn't renominate Palmer to serve on the canvassing board when her term concluded in 2021. The new Republican canvassers are Katherine Riley and Robert Boyd.

Riley, who's now chair of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers, according to the county's website, didn't respond Monday to a request for comment.

There are also two new Democrats on the board, Richard W. Preuss and Frank Woods Jr.

Jonathan Kinloch, a Democrat who was serving on the Wayne County canvassing board in 2020 and is now a Wayne County commissioner, said the question of whether boards will certify the results this fall is at the forefront of his mind.

Wayne County Republicans initially denied that they were going to attempt to block certification in 2020, Kinloch said. Where there's smoke, people should be concerned, he said.

""I think this is a tactic of theirs to create chaos,"" Kinloch said.

Legal backstops

If a county canvassing board refuses to certify an upcoming election, Michigan has legal ""backstops"" in place to deal with the development, Thomas said. But such an attempt could also further undermine people's faith in electoral outcomes, he acknowledged.

Under state processes, if a county board fails to determine a result, the job moves to the Board of State Canvassers, according to the Michigan Bureau of Elections.

The county board is supposed to immediately deliver all records and other information, including all necessary forms, to the Board of State Canvassers. A court could get involved to make sure that step happens.

When the 2020 presidential election reached the state board, one of the two Republicans on the statewide panel abstained: Norm Shinkle of Ingham County. But the other Republican, Aaron Van Langevelde, cast the deciding vote with the two Democrats in favor of certification.

At the time, Shinkle called for the Republican-led Legislature to conduct an in-depth review of election procedures, and he promoted theories about problems in Wayne County.

""I do not plan on voting for certification. I believe Wayne County's certification needs to be looked at,"" Shinkle said before abstaining.

Van Langevelde and Shinkle are both no longer on the board. They've been replaced by Tony Daunt and Richard Houskamp.

Daunt and Houskamp voted to certify the 2022 gubernatorial election, which Republican Tudor Dixon lost to Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer by about 10 percentage points. Daunt also has openly criticized Trump for spreading ""lies"" that the 2020 election was rigged."

2024-08-06,0.0667,"While the Left has received criticism for Trump's rise in popularity, it's important to look at the true nature of the Republican Party and its agenda of inequality, writes Dr Victoria Fielding.

DONALD TRUMP'S political popularity is not a backlash by disenfranchised voters suffering the ills of inequality. Trump's popularity is a movement based on the aggrieved entitlement of Americans who resent growing equality.

Trump offers these people - White men and often White women, too - the promise of pushing those with less power, women and non-White people, back down the ladder of inequality.

This means Trump is not the Left's fault. Trump is a reaction to the Left fighting for a more equal society.

It has become a popular trope amongst political analysts to blame the rise of Donald Trump's far-Right MAGA movement on the Democrats and the Left more broadly. The myth goes that Democratic presidents have not served the interests of the working class, particularly rural White American men, and that the resulting resentment about growing inequality led to the rise of Donald Trump.

America's gathering storm: Trump's culture of self-pity an ace up his sleeve

As unlikely as it seems that Donald Trump could be re-elected, his cult of personality could be enough to stir up votes and place him back in the Oval Office.

Sales says this divisive message resonates effectively with Trump's supporters because life has got harder for Americans with free trade disappearing jobs and industries, rising inflation, credit card defaults and bankruptcies, high interest rates and ""deaths of despair"" from suicide, alcoholism and drug addiction.

Not only does this representation of Trump's political support wrongly imply that Trump's base supports him because he is going to solve American inequality, but it also inaccurately implies that the Democrats do not work hard for equality.

Just like in Australian politics, what separates the Left from the Right in American politics is a desire by the Left to solve inequality, whereas the Right works to make it worse. This glaring fact is lost in attempts to blame Trump - a pro-inequality candidate - on those who oppose inequality at every turn.

Another example of attempts to apportion some blame for Trump's rise on the Democrats came from Stan Grant in The Saturday Paper. Grant takes aim at former President Barack Obama, criticising him for failing to solve race relations and inequality in America and saying Obama 'bequeathed a country primed for a populist like Trump'.

Big of him, Grant also lays a little bit of secondary blame on Trump, writing:

Race, gender, age will determine Kamala Harris' running mate

As Kamala Harris steps up to take on Donald Trump in the 2024 Presidential Election, political realities will determine who her running mate will be.

Grant's argument amounts to a claim that since Obama didn't solve inequality, particularly race inequality, it was only natural that Trump would exploit racism to win the 2016 Election.

Grant implies that solving inequality - supposedly doable within two four-year terms - is the Democrats' job and if they don't do that successfully, voters will naturally turn to the Republicans. These are the same Republicans who we all know have no intention of doing anything about inequality, but indeed are hellbent on making it worse.

As facts would have it, the American Council of Economic Advisors found in 2016 that the Obama Presidency carried out the 'most aggressive and successful attempt to reduce inequality in half a century'. On the other hand, just like the Right always does, Trump's Administration worked hard to increase inequality.

Whether he meant to or not, Grant did get close to describing the real reason Trump's MAGA movement grew out of Trump's racist, misogynistic promise to take America back to the past. Grant quotes political scientist George Friedman in saying White working-class voters rejected the Democratic ""elite"" because this elite attacked their churches' authoritative views as racist, sexist or homophobic.

This claim almost gets to the real reason why people support Trump, but misses a key point. The MAGA movement is not a backlash against ""elites"". At the heart of Trump's support is a backlash against those who fight for equality.

This includes some elites, but also, crucially, the victims of inequality themselves who unite in the movements against racism, sexism and homophobia, alongside struggles by the Left - including the union movement - to reduce income and wealth inequality.

Media has normalised Trump's bullying - it's time to take control

Presidential candidate Donald Trump has become notorious for his aggression and bullying, which the mainstream media is happy to ignore.

The vast majority of people in these movements, by the way, are suffering all the ills of inequality that Leigh Sales claims led to voters supporting Trump. What is the difference between them? Democrats fight for equality and Republicans fight against it. The fact is, MAGA is not just a political coalition premised on bigotry and hate, it is a sometimes-violent pushback against those who fight for a more equal society.

Grant might be right that the Obama Presidency influenced the rise of Trump, but he is offensively wrong about the reasons why. The true reason the MAGA base turned against Obama (if indeed any of them voted Democrat to start with) was because Obama was the symbolic face of American equality. MAGA voters could not fathom living in a society where a Black person could become President.

Trump's promise to ""Make America Great Again"" has always been an unspoken but constantly implied promise to make America more unequal again.

Just as Trump used Obama's race against him in his pro-inequality movement, he has already shown he plans to do the same to Vice President Kamala Harris. Harris symbolises race and gender equality. The MAGA movement could not accept a Black president and so it certainly can't accept a mixed-race, Black woman as leader.

Tropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia and the Carolinas

HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with torrential rain, high winds and flooding, contributing to at least five deaths as it turned menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatened to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities. Sarasota Police Department officials say about 500 residents were rescued from flooded homes. Record-setting rain was next expected to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Historic cities including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, are gearing up for potential high water. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 50 mph.

Ex-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped

PHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.

Proxy forces armed by Iran could take part in retaliation against Israel over Hamas leader's killing

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- As Iran threatens to respond to the suspected Israeli assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, the regional militias that the Islamic Republic has armed for decades could play a role in any attack. They include Lebanon's Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels of Yemen, Shiite militias in Iraq and others. Those relationships are managed by Iran's powerful paramilitary organization, the Revolutionary Guard. Iran relies on those proxy forces as international sanctions on Tehran, including over its nuclear program, have kept it from receiving advanced weaponry. While developing its own missile program, Iran also relies on militias as an asymmetric threat to squeeze Israel and the United States.

Saab said the duo ""falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council"" and they openly incited ""police and military officials to disobey the laws.""

Rally dates are set. Venues are chosen. The only thing missing for Harris' blitz is her VP choice

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.

Kamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.

In Israel and Lebanon, life goes on even as the region teeters on the edge of all-out war

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- In Beirut, shops are open and traffic is as snarled as ever. In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Everyone expects that an all-out war would be far more devastating than any previous conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.

Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.

PARIS (AP) -- The Olympics have their own language, traditions and rules. And they are ever-evolving. It can be a lot to take in. The Associated Press is answering some of the most asked questions about the Paris Games. What's in the box that athletes get with their medals? An official poster, meaning they can skip the gift shop. And if you wanted to know why the PARIS Olympics are in so many different cities, it's a combination of factors including space and appropriate facilities. It's also not uncommon among Olympics.

Sarasota Police Department officials say about 500 residents were rescued from flooded homes. Record-setting rain was next expected to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Historic cities including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, are gearing up for potential high water. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 50 mph.

PHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.

2024-08-06,-0.4196,"Google's parent company Alphabet Inc. has attributed failures in its search engine results about former President Donald Trump and the recent attempt on his life to unspecified ""bugs"" and the search engine's algorithm, according to Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio).

Google users searching for information about the former president last week reported their queries returned news stories about Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump's name was also noticeably absent from Google's list of suggested queries when users searched for it or about the July 13 assassination attempt against Trump.

Jordan, as head of the House Judiciary Committee and its Weaponization of the Federal Government panel, is investigating whether those anomalies were in error or part of a deliberate attempt to influence the 2024 presidential election.

""Through counsel, Alphabet admitted to the Committee and Select Subcommittee that, after the July 13 assassination attempt on President Trump, 'predictions for queries about the assassination attempt against former President Trump' 'should have appeared but didn't,'"" Jordan wrote.

According to the congressman, Google attorney Daniel Donovan attributed the issue to Google Search's ""out of date"" protections around political violence that were built into its autocomplete feature. Donovan also reportedly advised that the problem had been resolved.

The attorney similarly blamed the omission of Trump's name from Google's suggested searches list on ""a bug"" that was later fixed in an update.

As for why searches for Trump's name returned news stories about the vice president instead, Donovan reportedly attributed the problem to the search engine's algorithm, which automatically displays news stories related to inquiries.

""The company also noted that 'predictions ... may be unexpected or imperfect, and bugs will occur,'"" Jordan said of Alphabet's response.

Unsatisfied with Google's explanations, Jordan provided the attorney with a list of questions that committee members will expect him to answer at a briefing later this week.

Primarily, the committee wants to know when Google first learned of the referenced search problems, how long they occurred, how long it took to correct them, and their overall impacts on Americans' ability to obtain information about the Republican nominee for president.

The letter did not reveal the date of the briefing.

The suggested terms included ""president donald duck"" and ""president donald regan"" alongside a picture of President Ronald Reagan.

Trump's name was not on the list.

""Wow, Google has a search ban on President Donald Trump! Election interference?"" Musk wrote.

Google is not the only tech company to have faced such allegations in recent weeks.

In a July 30 statement, Meta acknowledged the fact-check label as ""a mistake"" prompted by the circulation of a different, doctored photo in which the Secret Service agents surrounding Trump reportedly appeared to be smiling.

Meanwhile, the company revealed that the chatbot issue was a deliberate move on the part of programmers to prevent the spread of inaccurate information.

""Rather than have Meta AI give incorrect information about the attempted assassination, we programmed it to simply not answer questions about it after it happened -- and instead give a generic response about how it couldn't provide any information. This is why some people reported our AI was refusing to talk about the event,"" the company said.

While the chatbot's responses have since been updated, Meta acknowledged that its programmers ""should have done this sooner.""

""We're committed to ensuring our platforms are a place where people can freely express themselves, and we are always working to make improvements,"" the company said.

In a July 30 Truth Social post that has since been deleted, Trump urged his supporters to ""go after"" Meta and Google for what he described as ""another attempt at rigging the election."""
2024-08-06,-0.0824,"Washington -- The Supreme Court on Monday rejected an attempt by the state of Missouri to stay former President Donald Trump's impending sentencing and lift a gag order imposed in the New York ""silence"" case until after the November presidential election.

The Supreme Court denied Missouri's request to file suit against New York and rejected a separate motion to stay Trump's conviction in an unsigned order. There were no dissents. Justices Clarence and Samuel Alito said they would have granted the state's request to file suit but would not have granted the other relief Missouri sought.

In May, a New York jury convicted Trump on 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal a $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election.

He has vowed to appeal his conviction, and his sentencing, originally scheduled for July 11, has been postponed until September 18. The New York judge overseeing the case, Judge Juan Merchan, lifted part of the gag order in June, but Trump is still not allowed to speak about prosecutors, court staff and their families.

Merchan must also decide by Sept. 6 whether to overturn Trump's conviction based on the Supreme Court's ruling that he is entitled to immunity from federal prosecution for official acts performed while in the White House. Trump's lawyers have argued that under the court's ruling, prosecutors should not have been allowed to present evidence at trial of the former president's official acts. Manhattan prosecutors disagree with their assertions.

In his request to stay Trump's sentence and temporarily lift the gag order, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican, claimed that New York prosecutors were trying to interfere with Trump's campaign by using their ""coercive power"" in the form of the gag order and the upcoming sentence.

""Allowing New York State to continue its actions during this election period infringes on voters' rights and sets a dangerous precedent that any of the thousands of elected prosecutors in other states could follow in the future,"" he wrote. ""The public interest is firmly on the side of Missouri and protecting the electoral process from this type of partisan interference.""

Bailey told the court that New York interfered with Missouri's electoral process by preventing electors and voters from seeing Trump during the campaign and hearing him speak. Even if Trump could schedule events in September and October, after his scheduled sentencing, the gag order would limit what he could say at those rallies, Bailey argued.

""The fact that Trump is being unfairly targeted by his general election opponent and his allies is of course very relevant to Trump's narrative about which candidate voters should support in November,"" he said.

Bailey said that while a criminal conviction or a publication ban would generally not interfere with voters' choice to elect their preferred candidate when he has no chance of winning, Trump is the Republican nominee for president and is leading in some states. He also said that Trump was not convicted of committing a violent crime, but rather of ""mere accounting violations.""

""There is no urgency to impose an immediate sentence and a gag order,"" the Republican attorney general wrote. ""What is urgent is that the American people hear from the major candidates without a state interfering with a candidate's campaign.""

New York officials have urged the Supreme Court to reject Missouri's attempt to suspend Trump's sentence, arguing that the state is trying to advance Trump's individual interests and that the nation's highest court has no role to play.

""Allowing Missouri to bring this lawsuit against New York would permit an extraordinary and dangerous maneuver to circumvent former President Trump's ongoing legal proceedings and the statutory limitations on this Court's jurisdiction to review state court decisions,"" Attorney General Letitia James wrote in a filing.

James, a Democrat, argued that the actions challenged by Missouri are not the fault of New York state, but rather of the Manhattan district attorney, who is elected by county voters.

""Allowing Missouri to invoke this court's jurisdiction to interfere with the enforcement of criminal law in New York is contrary to these fundamental principles and undermines New York's proud tradition of preserving the independence of local prosecutors,"" she wrote.

James also warned that Missouri's request for relief risks undermining the integrity of the courts and opening the way to a flood of similar litigation, which she called ""meritless.""

Missouri's push for relief that would benefit Trump is one of several attempts by Republicans to influence the criminal proceedings. Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York filed a misconduct complaint against Merchan with the state court system in May. The House Judiciary Committee, led by Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, has also been investigating the Manhattan prosecution of Trump.

Four Republican-led states have backed Missouri's bid to the Supreme Court, calling the allegation ""serious"" that New York is using its criminal process to interfere with the 2024 presidential election.

""Missouri argues that this court should step in to delay these politically motivated lawsuits until after the election in order to thwart their apparent goal of interfering with the vote,"" Republican officials from Florida, Iowa, Alaska and Montana said in a filing. ""That is a serious claim, and this court has a constitutional and statutory obligation to resolve it.""

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge has ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Dow drops 1,000 points, and Japanese stocks suffer worst crash since 1987 as markets quake worldwide

NEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsened and set off another sell-off for financial markets around the world. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed a 12.4% plunge for Japan's Nikkei 225, its worst since 1987. Treasury yields pared their losses after a report showed U.S. services businesses are continuing to grow. But worries are still high after Friday's report showing U.S. employers pulled back on hiring last month by more than expected.

Tropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia and the Carolinas

HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with torrential rain, high winds and flooding, contributing to at least five deaths as it turned menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatened to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities. Sarasota Police Department officials say about 500 residents were rescued from flooded homes. Record-setting rain was next expected to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Historic cities including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, are gearing up for potential high water. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 50 mph.

Ex-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped

PHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.

Venezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo ""falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council"" and they openly incited ""police and military officials to disobey the laws.""

Rally dates are set. Venues are chosen. The only thing missing for Harris' blitz is her VP choice

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.

Kamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.

In Israel and Lebanon, life goes on even as the region teeters on the edge of all-out war

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- In Beirut, shops are open and traffic is as snarled as ever. In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Everyone expects that an all-out war would be far more devastating than any previous conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.

Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.

2024-08-06,0.098,"Kellyanne Conway, former advisor to President Donald Trump, has registered as a lobbyist for Ukrainian billionaire Victor Pinchuk. This information comes from a recent foreign agent disclosure filing.

What Happened: Conway registered last Friday to represent Pinchuk's foundation. The filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act reveals that Conway will liaise with U.S. lawmakers and experts on Ukraine's interests and raise awareness about ""Ukrainians' fight for freedom and the Russian illegal war of aggression,"" reported The Hill.

Conway is also expected to encourage U.S. lawmakers to attend the Yalta European Strategy annual meeting in Kyiv on Sept. 13-14. She will represent the U.K. office of the Victor Pinchuk Foundation, a private, nonpartisan, philanthropic company focused on advancing various causes in Ukraine.

The filing also reveals that Pinchuk ""owns and controls"" the foundation, which is not owned or controlled by the Ukrainian government. However, the Ukrainian government is the ""principal beneficiary of the registrant's activities directed by the foreign principal.""

Conway's agreement with the foundation includes a monthly fee of $50,000, with the term of the agreement running from July 25 to Nov. 14.

This move comes amidst hesitation from many Republicans to approve more aid to Ukraine. Conway's former boss, Trump, has previously suggested that additional aid to Ukraine could come as a loan and claimed he could end the war in 24 hours if he were in the White House.

Why It Matters: Conway is known for coining the phrase ""Alternative Facts"" during a Meet The Press interview in January 2017 when she defended White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer's false narrative about Trump's inauguration attendance figures.

More recently in 2022, she criticized Pennsylvania Democratic Senate nominee John Fetterman (D-Pa.) for his support of cannabis legalization.

In August 2023, she speculated that President Joe Biden might not participate in any debates in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election. However, the president did end up debating Trump but his disappointing performance led to his ultimate exit from the race.

2024-08-06,0.2784,"WASHINGTON -- Congressional Republicans, led by Michigan U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg, have introduced bills to reverse ambitious new vehicle fuel economy regulations issued by the Biden administration.

The administration's Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, commonly known as CAFE, were finalized in June and would require automakers' new vehicle fleets to achieve an average fuel economy of 53.5 miles per gallon by 2032.

""The extreme (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) CAFE standards are the latest attempt by the Biden-Harris administration to strip away choice from American consumers and mandate EVs,"" the Tipton Republican said in a statement about his bill.

Though the in-the-weeds technicalities of regulatory affairs aren't usually popular household issues, rules affecting the future of the U.S. auto industry have become a mainstay of the 2024 presidential election.

Republicans -- headlined by presidential nominee Donald Trump -- have consistently railed against President Joe Biden's efforts to significantly curb tailpipe emissions and encourage a shift toward electric vehicles as ways to fight climate change and keep pace with China's emergence as the world's leading EV maker.

Biden and his allies, meanwhile, have cheered the CAFE standards and similar efforts as smart for consumers' wallets and prudent for the future of the auto industry.

""Not only will these new standards save Americans money at the pump every time they fill up, they will also decrease harmful pollution and make America less reliant on foreign oil,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in June. ""These standards will save car owners more than $600 in gasoline costs over the lifetime of their vehicle.""

Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is leading a companion push on the Senate side to cancel the CAFE standards. The bills in both chambers invoke the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to rescind regulations shortly after they're finalized.

The effort is unlikely to succeed in the current politically divided Congress.

However, Republicans might be able to revive the action early next year if they win control of both chambers and the White House in November. That is due to a so-called lookback provision in the CRA that allows Congress to revisit late-passing rules from a previous presidential administration.

The highly-anticipated trigger date for the lookback period will not be final until at least one chamber of Congress adjourns for the year.

All regulations finalized after that date -- on average July 18, per a report from the Administrative Conference of the United States -- would be open to renewed challenges if Republicans manage to sweep the general elections.

That would keep the June 7 fuel economy standards safe from a later CRA challenge, though some observers think the window will close earlier this year.

The CAFE rule is one of many actions from Biden meant to reduce the environmental impact of consumer vehicles, which make up about 16% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, per EPA data.

His administration has devoted considerable time and resources to the matter, employing incentives and punitive regulations that push the auto industry toward electrification.

Other efforts have included two other key rules aimed at reducing tailpipe emissions; a $7,500 tax credit on qualifying new EV purchases via the climate-minded Inflation Reduction Act; $7.5 billion for EV charger buildout via the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law; IRA-funded manufacturing subsidies to repurpose old industrial centers for EVs; and a set of new tariffs that aim to protect U.S. automakers from competition with China, which has emerged as the world leader in EVs.

Republicans have roundly opposed those efforts.

""The Biden-Harris administration has declared war against affordable gas-powered cars,"" Cruz said in a statement, alluding to Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. ""I'm leading the effort in the Senate to stop radical environmentalists from both abusing the rulemaking process and trying to force electric vehicles on consumers who do not want them.""

""Unlike the Biden-Harris administration, Republicans continue to fight for consumers and innovators to have the ability to shape the future of the auto industry,"" Walberg added, ""not just unelected bureaucrats issuing radical mandates from Washington."""

2024-08-06,0.0667,"Less than 90 days remain until the 2024 presidential election, and a federal judge in Washington, D.C., recently approved the return of a spear and horned headdress to Jacob Chansley, known as the ""QAnon Shaman"" and a convicted participant in the January 6 riot.

Jacob Chansley requested the federal government to return all seized property related to his Capitol breach arrest. He also wanted to shorten his supervised release from three years to 12 months. Prosecutors opposed returning the items, citing them as evidence. However, they mentioned that if the items were returned, Chansley would need to assure the court that he would not challenge his criminal conviction further.

In a 6-page order on Monday, Senior U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth wrote:

On January 6, 2021, defendant Jacob Anthony Chansley joined the Capitol breach like many others but gained global attention due to his unique attire, which included a horned headdress, face paint, gloves, and a weapon in the form of a six-foot pole with an American flag and metal spearhead.

Mr. Chansley has completed his prison sentence and much of his term of supervised release. Now, he has moved for the return of his property seized and still held by the government, including his spear and helmet. Since the government has not established that it still needs these items as evidence and has not sought their forfeiture, the Court will GRANT Mr. Chansley's motion.

Chansley was sentenced in November 2021 to 41 months in prison and 36 months supervised release. Originally facing six charges, he struck a plea deal and pleaded guilty to only one count: obstruction of an official proceeding, a charge recently narrowed by the U.S. Supreme Court in Fischer v. United States.

All told, Chansley was incarcerated for 11 months before being released to a halfway house in March 2023 so he could start his supervised release program. When he tried to end that early, prosecutors reminded Lamberth that though the judge was effusive with his praise of Chansley at sentencing -- he had called Chansley's mea culpa ""the most remarkable I've heard in 34 years"" and ""akin to the kind of thing Martin Luther King would have said"" -- it was just two years after that when the judge expressed a certain degree of buyer's remorse.

Lamberth had learned that Chansley gave interviews to the press that were a far cry from contrite; the defendant said that he regretted pleading guilty.

Lamberth acknowledged this in his Monday order as well as Chansley's subsequent appeal. That appeal didn't go far because Chansley withdrew it. But he then he moved to vacate his sentence, claiming he had new evidence to vindicate himself and further, that he had ""ineffective assistance of his plea counsel.""

That motion was denied and the judge reminded Chansley of that fact on Monday -- as well as his prior ""disappointment that 'Mr. Chansley has recanted the contrition displayed at his sentencing.""""

In a footnote of the order, Lamberth notably included a snippet of Chansley's statement from sentencing that had so moved the judge and came back to bite him later:

So I had to come to terms with the fact that I was in solitary confinement because of me, because of my decision. I broke the law, and if I believe in freedom, if I believe in law and order, if I believe in responsibility and accountability, then that means that I should do what Gandhi would do and take responsibility even and especially when it incriminates me,"" Chansley said at sentencing. ""No ifs, ands, or buts about it. That's what men of honor do. I am truly, truly repentant for my actions, because repentance is not just saying you're sorry. Repentance is apologizing and then moving in the exact opposite direction of the sin that you committed. And that's what I've been trying to do ever since I realized the magnitude of my error and the magnitude of my mistake. [I]n retrospect, I would do everything differently on January 6. In all honesty, I would do everything differently.

Though the ""QAnon Shaman"" will have his iconic spear and fur-lined helmet back, Lamberth was silent on Chansley's July request for an early release from supervised probation.

Instead, the judge said only that the government had failed to establish why Chansley's property was ""evidence"" at this stage and that it was not clear to him ""how Mr. Chansley could contest his conviction, as he has been sentenced, abandoned his direct appeal, and seen his § 2255 motion denied.""

""But even if the government may need to reprove Mr. Chansley's guilt, the government has not explained why it would need his property,"" Lamberth wrote, adding that it was not enough for prosecutors to suggest the government may ""eventually"" seek civil forfeiture.

While Chansley was the ""face of the riot,"" the judge wrote, and ""images of him at the Capitol on that day abound,"" three years have passed and prosecutors have ""never sought forfeiture of the property involved in the Capitol siege.""

""As there is voluminous video and photo evidence of Mr. Chansley's conduct, his property is of little utility for an investigation or prosecution and 'the United States' legitimate interests can be satisfied even if the property is returned ... The Court therefore finds that the retention of Mr. Chansley's property would be unreasonable,"" the judge wrote.

""But when the government has vast amounts of other evidence, it cannot defeat a Rule 41(g) motion simply by asserting its desire to retain the evidence without giving any reasons,"" the judge wrote."
2024-08-06,-0.4196,"The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a lawsuit filed by Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey seeking to lift a gag order and delay Donald Trump's sentencing on multiple convictions in his New York City hush money trial. Bailey said in a statement that New York's ""illicit prosecution"" has undermined the Republican candidate's ability to run for president.

Bailey filed the suit in July, arguing that the state of New York violated ""Missourians' First Amendment right to hear from a presidential candidate in the 2024 presidential election.""

Tuesday, August 6, is a day that is set to be underlined by various crucial events across the globe.

Turmoil in Bangladesh has led its PM Sheikh Hasina to flee with the army coming in to form an interim government. It remains to be seen what step will be taken to ensure stability and peace.

In the US, Democratic party presidential nominee and current US Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to campaign in battleground states with her running mate.

Over in Paris where the 2024 Olympics are in full swing, India's only athletics Olympic gold medalist Neeraj Chopra will enter the arena for his event - the Javelin throw.

India is hosting the first Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Business Summit in New Delhi from today. The event will conclude on August 8.

Hasina flees, Bangladesh burns

Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has stepped down amidst violent protests across the country. The announcement of an interim government taking charge was made by Bangladesh Army Chief General Waqar-uz-Zaman on Monday.

There are unconfirmed reports suggesting she may be heading to a city in India.

Recently, she faced accusations of suppressing the opposition and acting like a dictator. A movement had been ongoing in the country for over a month. In the last two days alone, hundreds of people have lost their lives in protests against the Hasina government.

The unrest initially began as a protest against job quotas but quickly escalated into widespread anger against the Hasina administration, involving people from all segments of society. It is believed that the united front presented by the opposition played a significant role in compelling Hasina to resign.

Harris and co to tour battleground states

US Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running for president as a Democrat, will start a four-day visit to key states with her running mate on August 6, as announced by her campaign on Thursday.

This has led to increased speculation about the potential candidate. The identity of Harris's running mate for the 2024 presidential election remains a well-kept secret and is expected to be revealed today. According to US media reports, top contenders include Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.

Harris, 59, is the only person who has submitted paperwork to be the Democratic Party's nominee for the November 5 presidential election after US President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the race and endorsed her as the candidate on July 20.

Neeraj Chopra enters

One of India's top medal contenders, Olympic gold medalist Neeraj Chopra, was yet to begin competing. Although the track and field events at the Paris Olympics are already in progress, Chopra's event, the men's javelin throw came a few days later.

The men's javelin qualifiers is set for Tuesday, when Chopra will make his first appearance in the French capital. If the defending champion advances to the final, he will compete again to retain his title on August 8.

Chopra won the gold medal in the men's javelin at the delayed Tokyo Olympics with a throw of 87.58 meters. After his victory at the Tokyo Games, he also secured the World Championship title.

BIMSTEC in India - A first

India will host the inaugural Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Business Summit in New Delhi from August 6-8. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), in collaboration with the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII), is organising the event.

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will inaugurate the Business Summit, with Union Minister of Commerce and Industries Piyush Goyal and other leaders set to deliver keynote speeches."

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge has ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Dow drops 1,000 points, and Japanese stocks suffer worst crash since 1987 as markets quake worldwide

NEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsened and set off another sell-off for financial markets around the world. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed a 12.4% plunge for Japan's Nikkei 225, its worst since 1987. Treasury yields pared their losses after a report showed U.S. services businesses are continuing to grow. But worries are still high after Friday's report showing U.S. employers pulled back on hiring last month by more than expected.

Tropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia and the Carolinas

HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with torrential rain, high winds and flooding, contributing to at least five deaths as it turned menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatened to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities. Record-setting rain was expected to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Historic cities including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, are gearing up for potential high water. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 50 mph.

Ex-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped

PHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.

Venezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo ""falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council"" and they openly incited ""police and military officials to disobey the laws.""

Rally dates are set. Venues are chosen. The only thing missing for Harris' blitz is her VP choice

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.

Kamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.

In Israel and Lebanon, life goes on even as the region teeters on the edge of all-out war

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- In Beirut, shops are open and traffic is as snarled as ever. In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Everyone expects that an all-out war would be far more devastating than any previous conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.

Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.

What's the deal with the Olympics? Your burning questions, answered

PARIS (AP) -- The Olympics have their own language, traditions and rules. And they are ever-evolving. It can be a lot to take in.

An official poster, meaning they can skip the gift shop. And if you wanted to know why the PARIS Olympics are in so many different cities, it's a combination of factors including space and appropriate facilities. It's also not uncommon among Olympics."
2024-08-06,0.051,"WASHINGTON - Congressional Republicans, led by Michigan U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg, have introduced bills to reverse ambitious new vehicle fuel economy regulations issued by the Biden administration.

The administration's Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, commonly known as CAFE, were finalized in June and would require automakers' new vehicle fleets to achieve an average fuel economy of 53.5 miles per gallon by 2032.

""The extreme (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) CAFE standards are the latest attempt by the Biden-Harris administration to strip away choice from American consumers and mandate EVs,"" the Tipton Republican said in a statement about his bill.

Though the in-the-weeds technicalities of regulatory affairs aren't usually popular household issues, rules affecting the future of the U.S. auto industry have become a mainstay of the 2024 presidential election.

Republicans - headlined by presidential nominee Donald Trump - have consistently railed against President Joe Biden's efforts to significantly curb tailpipe emissions and encourage a shift toward electric vehicles as ways to fight climate change and keep pace with China's emergence as the world's leading EV maker.

Biden and his allies, meanwhile, have cheered the CAFE standards and similar efforts as smart for consumers' wallets and prudent for the future of the auto industry.

""Not only will these new standards save Americans money at the pump every time they fill up, they will also decrease harmful pollution and make America less reliant on foreign oil,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in June. ""These standards will save car owners more than $600 in gasoline costs over the lifetime of their vehicle.""

Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is leading a companion push on the Senate side to cancel the CAFE standards. The bills in both chambers invoke the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to rescind regulations shortly after they're finalized.

The effort is unlikely to succeed in the current politically divided Congress.

However, Republicans might be able to revive the action early next year if they win control of both chambers and the White House in November. That is due to a so-called lookback provision in the CRA that allows Congress to revisit late-passing rules from a previous presidential administration.

The highly-anticipated trigger date for the lookback period will not be final until at least one chamber of Congress adjourns for the year.

All regulations finalized after that date - on average July 18, per a report from the Administrative Conference of the United States - would be open to renewed challenges if Republicans manage to sweep the general elections.

That would keep the June 7 fuel economy standards safe from a later CRA challenge, though some observers think the window will close earlier this year.

The CAFE rule is one of many actions from Biden meant to reduce the environmental impact of consumer vehicles, which make up about 16% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, per EPA data.

His administration has devoted considerable time and resources to the matter, employing incentives and punitive regulations that push the auto industry toward electrification.

Other efforts have included two otherkey rules aimed at reducing tailpipe emissions; a $7,500 tax credit on qualifying new EV purchases via the climate-minded Inflation Reduction Act; $7.5 billion for EV charger buildout via the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law; IRA-funded manufacturing subsidies to repurpose old industrial centers for EVs; and a set of new tariffs that aim to protect U.S. automakers from competition with China, which has emerged as the world leader in EVs.

Republicans have roundly opposed those efforts.

""The Biden-Harris administration has declared war against affordable gas-powered cars,"" Cruz said in a statement, alluding to Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. ""I'm leading the effort in the Senate to stop radical environmentalists from both abusing the rulemaking process and trying to force electric vehicles on consumers who do not want them.""

""Unlike the Biden-Harris administration, Republicans continue to fight for consumers and innovators to have the ability to shape the future of the auto industry,"" Walberg added, ""not just unelected bureaucrats issuing radical mandates from Washington."""

""I'm leading the effort in the Senate to stop radical environmentalists from both abusing the rulemaking process and trying to force electric vehicles on consumers who do not want them.""

""Unlike the Biden-Harris administration, Republicans continue to fight for consumers and innovators to have the ability to shape the future of the auto industry,"" Walberg added, ""not just unelected bureaucrats issuing radical mandates from Washington."""
2024-08-06,0.051,"WASHINGTON - Congressional Republicans, led by Michigan U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg, have introduced bills to reverse ambitious new vehicle fuel economy regulations issued by the Biden administration.

The administration's Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, commonly known as CAFE, were finalized in June and would require automakers' new vehicle fleets to achieve an average fuel economy of 53.5 miles per gallon by 2032.

""The extreme (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) CAFE standards are the latest attempt by the Biden-Harris administration to strip away choice from American consumers and mandate EVs,"" the Tipton Republican said in a statement about his bill.

Though the in-the-weeds technicalities of regulatory affairs aren't usually popular household issues, rules affecting the future of the U.S. auto industry have become a mainstay of the 2024 presidential election.

Republicans - headlined by presidential nominee Donald Trump - have consistently railed against President Joe Biden's efforts to significantly curb tailpipe emissions and encourage a shift toward electric vehicles as ways to fight climate change and keep pace with China's emergence as the world's leading EV maker.

Biden and his allies, meanwhile, have cheered the CAFE standards and similar efforts as smart for consumers' wallets and prudent for the future of the auto industry.

""Not only will these new standards save Americans money at the pump every time they fill up, they will also decrease harmful pollution and make America less reliant on foreign oil,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in June. ""These standards will save car owners more than $600 in gasoline costs over the lifetime of their vehicle.""

Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is leading a companion push on the Senate side to cancel the CAFE standards. The bills in both chambers invoke the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to rescind regulations shortly after they're finalized.

The effort is unlikely to succeed in the current politically divided Congress.

However, Republicans might be able to revive the action early next year if they win control of both chambers and the White House in November. That is due to a so-called lookback provision in the CRA that allows Congress to revisit late-passing rules from a previous presidential administration.

The highly-anticipated trigger date for the lookback period will not be final until at least one chamber of Congress adjourns for the year.

All regulations finalized after that date - on average July 18, per a report from the Administrative Conference of the United States - would be open to renewed challenges if Republicans manage to sweep the general elections.

That would keep the June 7 fuel economy standards safe from a later CRA challenge, though some observers think the window will close earlier this year.

The CAFE rule is one of many actions from Biden meant to reduce the environmental impact of consumer vehicles, which make up about 16% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, per EPA data.

His administration has devoted considerable time and resources to the matter, employing incentives and punitive regulations that push the auto industry toward electrification.

Other efforts have included two otherkey rules aimed at reducing tailpipe emissions; a $7,500 tax credit on qualifying new EV purchases via the climate-minded Inflation Reduction Act; $7.5 billion for EV charger buildout via the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law; IRA-funded manufacturing subsidies to repurpose old industrial centers for EVs; and a set of new tariffs that aim to protect U.S. automakers from competition with China, which has emerged as the world leader in EVs.

Republicans have roundly opposed those efforts.

""The Biden-Harris administration has declared war against affordable gas-powered cars,"" Cruz said in a statement, alluding to Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. ""I'm leading the effort in the Senate to stop radical environmentalists from both abusing the rulemaking process and trying to force electric vehicles on consumers who do not want them.""

""Unlike the Biden-Harris administration, Republicans continue to fight for consumers and innovators to have the ability to shape the future of the auto industry,"" Walberg added, ""not just unelected bureaucrats issuing radical mandates from Washington."""
