Unbeknownst to most Americans, that term, ""learned helplessness,"" was profoundly and inextricably tied to this country's disastrous post-9/11 Global War on Terror and, in particular, its horrifying torture program. Yet there it was, being used in a new context -- one that, while perhaps altered by the president's recent decision not to run for a second term, has been employed with remarkable frequency in the intervening months, especially recently, when it comes to this country's presidential future.

As the pundits weighed in on Joe Biden's abysmal performance at that June 27th debate with Donald Trump and cast doubt on his prospects for reelection, ""learned helplessness"" was used over and over again in the days leading up to his withdrawal from the presidential race in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris. Two days after the debate, for instance, The Economist, focusing on Biden's refusal to declare himself a non-candidate for the presidency, concluded that ""many [Democrats] have fallen into learned helplessness,"" as evidenced by the gap between their private doubts and their public assertions.

Writing for the San Francisco-based progressive daily, 48hills, Bruce Mirkin chastised the Democrats for choosing hopelessness over hope. ""Instead of 'yes, we can,'"" he wrote, ""the instinctive response from a good portion of the folks who should be helping to defend democracy seems to be 'no, we can't.'"" He then labeled the party's inaction ""learned helplessness."" Jordan Zakarin, writing for the Center for American Progress Action's Progress Report, extended that diagnosis from ""the worst debate performance in modern history"" to the larger moment in Washington. He pointed, for instance, to Attorney General Merrick Garland having ""slow-walked prosecuting Donald Trump."" ""It is,"" he concluded, ""a learned helplessness,"" a ""preemptive surrender.""

The question is: What should we make of the concept of ""learned helplessness""? Where did it come from and what are the remedies writ large? In this distinctly disturbing moment in our history, is it possible that an all-American version of despair and hopelessness has changed in light of Joe Biden's backing out of the presidential race?

The Psychological Concept

To better understand the sudden shower of references to ""learned helplessness,"" a little history is in order. In the late 1960s, psychologist Martin Seligman coined the term while conducting experiments with dogs. He had accidentally stumbled on the fact that dogs that experienced electrical shocks without having any control over starting or stopping them were ultimately rendered strangely passive. They proved unwilling to move, even to escape further mistreatment.

After more experiments demonstrated that being subjected to severe pain or stress did indeed induce a state of inaction in dogs, Seligman then turned to humans and discovered that individuals who had suffered an act or acts of trauma and abuse continued, well after the painful incident, to show signs of depression and anxiety that rendered them completely unable to act. They continued to exist, he discovered, in a state of profound resignation and inaction, long after the traumatic moment in which they found themselves powerless. Afterward, they were convinced that nothing was under their control, that any action they might take would be futile, and that failure was inevitable, should they even try to act. (Later studies suggested that some elderly individuals might also experience such a state of profound resignation and inaction in response to ""stressful life events,"" at times in association with dementia.)

But here's the truly strange thing: more than three decades later in the years after the 9/11 attacks, Seligman's concept of ""learned helplessness"" would be quite purposely baked into the interrogation and torture program created and implemented for war on terror detainees by American officials during the administration of President George W. Bush. As the executive summary of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's torture report explained, one of the two psychologists contracted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for the purpose of devising its interrogation program ""had reviewed research on 'learned helplessness,' in which individuals might become passive and depressed in response to adverse or uncontrollable events. He theorized,"" the report added, ""that inducing such a state could encourage a detainee to cooperate and provide information.""

That psychologist, Bruce Mitchell, even met with Seligman while designing techniques to use on war-on-terror detainees suspected of ties to the 9/11 terror group al-Qaeda and its leadership at the secret ""black sites"" the CIA set up globally. (Seligman, it seems, had no idea of the horrors Mitchell and his associates were planning.) Ironically enough, Seligman's findings and his concept of ""learned helplessness"" would indeed become a basic part of the development of the CIA's torture program. (Seligman would come to condemn the use of the concept for interrogations at those black sites. As The Washington Post reported, ""When [Seligman] later learned through media accounts how it was employed -- for enhanced interrogation -- he issued a statement: 'I am grieved and horrified that good science, which has helped so many people overcome depression, may have been used for such bad purposes.'"")

To induce a profound state of helplessness, those post-9/11 captives were sent to the CIA's black sites where they were subjected to ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" designed to elicit information from them. Their torture included beatings, being smashed into walls, being hung by their limbs in excruciatingly painful positions, forced nudity, sodomy, and repeated sleep deprivation, among other things. The CIA also used waterboarding (subjecting detainees to the feeling of drowning), placed them in coffin-like boxes, and threatened to use a gun or a power drill on those who refused to give answers sought by their interrogators. Just last month, in a pre-trial hearing at the forever prison the Bush administration set up offshore -- and away from the federal court system -- at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, in 2002, such techniques were once again described in detail, this time by John Bruce Jessen, the psychologist who, along with Mitchell, designed the nightmarish interrogation program. In addition to his testimony, he also demonstrated the technique of ""walling,"" which involved slamming a detainee's head against a wall.

The goal was simple: to reduce that prisoner to a profound state of complete paralysis and disempowerment in which, having no hope of relief or escape, he would do whatever his captors wanted. Detainees would see that there was no way out but to answer their captors' questions, which, it turned out, often led them, in desperation and a state of learned helplessness, to confess to things they hadn't done, to confess to whatever their captors wanted to hear.

Having studied and written about the nightmare of those prisoners and Guantánamo for so many years now, it's been supremely jarring to see the term ""learned helplessness"" re-emerge in connection to the current unnerving state of American politics and the 2024 presidential election. Yet, in many ways, it seems a strangely appropriate lens through which to view the world of Donald Trump and the rest of us. It was true, as many commented, that a sense of learned helplessness indisputably crept into the mindset of so many of us in this country -- at least prior to Joe Biden's decision not to pursue a second term as president.

The American people have indeed suffered multiple stressful, even traumatic experiences in recent years. The shock of a government that didn't protect them on September 11, 2001; the devastating experience of a president who refused to protect them from Covid, as bodies piled up on the streets of this country; the winnowing away of rights and liberties once protected by the Constitution and the Supreme Court -- from the overturning of Roe v. Wade to a rash of recent decisions, including one that gave a president essential immunity in relation to more or less anything he did, no matter how devastating; the inability of the courts to proceed in their prosecutions of Donald Trump; the nearly paralyzed state of a riven Congress amid an economic reality that has led so many younger Americans to be unable to purchase their own homes or send their children to college -- all have collectively cowed the population. Even before both the Supreme Court's presidential immunity decision and the dismal debate performance of Biden, a sense of learned helplessness seemed well in place, and understandably so.

The Republican Party has also succumbed to a state of learned helplessness. One after another, former opponents of Trump and the MAGA ideology he stands for have succumbed to his agenda and given up on pursuing their own independent goals. Republican vice-presidential nominee J.D. Vance is certainly a case in point. Having formerly called out Trump for his lack of morality, his xenophobia, and his racism, as well as for being a ""total fraud"" and ""America's Hitler,"" he is now on board with the ideas he once said he deplored, including, for example, an untethered anti-immigration stance that calls for massive deportations of illegal immigrants. Similarly, Trump's Republican election opponent Nikki Haley has given up her ""legacy of blunt assessments and brutal takedowns"" of the former president, as The Nation's John Nichols has aptly described her opposition to Trump, whom she once described as ""a dangerous stooge of Russian president Vladimir Putin.""

The question is: What, if anything, does the research tell us about curing such a state?

Is There, in Fact, a Cure?

Psychologists do point to remedies for such a profound state of hopelessness. They suggest several healing paths forward, including therapy to examine the causes of one's despair and to discover constructive paths beyond it; exercise to stimulate the body and the mind; and a commitment to ""learned optimism,"" a pattern of reaction geared to expecting the best rather than the worst out of any situation. As Psychology Today points out, ""Seligman later developed the concept of learned optimism. By explaining events to ourselves in a constructive manner and developing a positive internal dialogue, people can break free from their cycle of helplessness."" Small wins and an energized commitment to positivity are basic tenets of finding a way to ""learned optimism.""

If a turn towards optimism offers a way out of the helplessness of our times, perhaps we are seeing the beginning of just such an event. Recently, Slate's Dahlia Lithwick, again invoking the term ""learned helplessness,"" suggested that reports of the plans of the Biden administration to back Supreme Court reform were a sign of the kind of future ""systemwide cognitive reboot for American voters that seems almost inconceivable in the generalized torpor and despair of July 2024."" The headline of her article read, appropriately enough, ""Are We Finally Letting Go of Our Learned-Helplessness Syndrome Around the Supreme Court?""

So, too, the outpouring of energy and excitement following Biden's decision to bow out of the presidential race and the enthusiasm for newer, younger Democratic Party leadership -- and for Vice President Kamala Harris, in particular -- already seems eons removed from the head-shaking resignation of Democratic voters confronting a ""choice"" between an aging Joe Biden and You Know Who on election day. In fact, in many ways, that new turn of affairs could be just what the doctor ordered, though, of course, a possible November election victory for Donald Trump could still put the phrase ""learned helplessness"" in a grimly new light.

For Democrats, the idea that there could be a brighter future, one in which a sense of control replaced one of powerlessness -- an election in which their presidential candidate has a viable chance of winning -- has taken hold. In place of anxiety and depression, there is optimism, or at least a ""cautious hope."" Declaring her ""immense pride and limitless optimism for our country's future,"" Nancy Pelosi echoed the importance of this newfound optimism when endorsing Kamala Harris as the party's candidate for 2024. As Tim Alberta summed it up in The Atlantic, ""As far back as springtime, the numbers told a straightforward story: Biden was not going to win. Democrats could only look on, powerless."" However, now, he concludes, it is the Republicans who are feeling hope and control fade away: ""Sunday brought an unfamiliar feeling of powerlessness. For the first time in a long time, Trump does not control the narrative of 2024.""

Whether or not such optimism gains momentum in the potentially tumultuous days ahead remains to be seen, as does whether the Republicans can find a way out of their own potential sense of learned helplessness in the face of a changing scenario. Whatever happens, given what I know about the past use of that phrase and the nightmare of the war on terror's use of torture, my own hope is that, with election 2024, the very concept of learned helplessness and the realities it represents, whether it applies to torture at the hands of the U.S. government or suffering at the hands of Trumpian politics, can finally be politically laid to rest.

Call it learned optimism, if you wish, but fingers crossed.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is now official after the Democratic National Committee announced the formal results of the online voting by delegates on Monday night.

Slow-moving Tropical Storm Debby bringing torrential rains, major flood threat to southeastern US

HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby has moved menacingly into some of America's most historic Southern cities in what is expected to be a prolonged event of torrential downpours and flooding after slamming into Florida with heavy rain and high winds. Record-setting rain from the storm that killed at least five people on Monday was causing flash flooding in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Savannah Mayor Van Johnson told residents Monday night to hunker down and expect a rough day on Tuesday. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida Monday as a Category 1 hurricane.

Israel-Hamas war latest: Palestinians killed in West Bank as world leaders try to avoid regional war

Four Palestinians have been killed and seven wounded by Israeli fire during a military raid in the occupied West Bank. World leaders meanwhile are trying to stop tensions in the Middle East from boiling over into a regional war after the killings of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon and Hamas' top political leader in Iran. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah says it launched a drone attack early Monday on northern Israel that the Israeli military said wounded two Israeli troops. Leaders in Egypt and Turkey say they are exhausting all avenues possible to prevent the Israel-Hamas war from becoming a wider regional conflict. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his Cabinet over the weekend that Israel is already in a ""multi-front war"" with Iran and its proxies.

Protesters who toppled Hasina want Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus to lead Bangladesh

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- A key organizer of Bangladesh's student protests says Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is their choice as head of an interim government a day after longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned. The country's figurehead president and the military chief said Monday that an interim government would be formed soon. Nahid Islam, the organizer, in a video post in social media said Tuesday the student protest leaders have already talked with Yunus, who consented to take over. Islam said the student protesters would announce more names for the government, and it would be a difficult challenge for the current leadership to ignore their choices.

Japan's share benchmark soars nearly 11% a day after massive sell-offs that shook Wall Street

NEW YORK (AP) -- Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index has soared more than 10% a day after it set markets tumbling in Europe and on Wall Street, while other world markets appeared to have settled after the rollercoaster ride that started the week. The Japanese index fell back after its biggest early advance, gaining 8.7% by midmorning on Tuesday. On Monday, nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as world markets quaked under fears the U.S. economy is slowing too much. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed the Nikkei's 12.4% plunge, its worst since 1987.

Venezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo ""falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council"" and they openly incited ""police and military officials to disobey the laws.""

Google illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge has ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Witnesses will tell a federal safety board about the blowout on a Boeing 737 Max earlier this year

The National Transportation Safety Board is about to hold a two-day hearing into the blowout of a panel from the side of a Boeing 737 Max airliner. The safety board's hearing starts Tuesday in Washington, D.C. It will hear from witnesses including its own investigators who have been looking into the Jan. 5 accident that occurred during an Alaska Airlines flight. The board is calling it a fact-finding hearing. The NTSB will not vote on a probable cause for the accident. That step probably won't happen for another year or longer after more investigation.

Hiroshima governor says nuclear disarmament must be tackled as a pressing issue, not an ideal

TOKYO (AP) -- Hiroshima officials are urging world leaders to stop relying on nuclear weapons as deterrence and take immediate action toward abolishment -- not as an ideal, but to remove the risk of atomic war amid the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. They commented Tuesday as the city remembered its atomic bombing 79 years ago at the end of World War II. The memorial comes days after Japan and the U.S. reaffirmed Washington's commitment to ""extended deterrence,"" including atomic weapons, to protect its Asian ally. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has vowed to do his utmost to pursue ""realistic and practical measures"" to build global momentum for nuclear disarmament. Critics say it is a hollow promise.

With it, she delivers a grave warning that the casual mockery and mimicry of political violence in America is chasing a generation from public service.

She twice won the speakers gavel, worked alongside seven presidents and, more recently, played a pivotal role in quietly convincing President Joe Biden to reassess his decision to remain in the 2024 presidential election rematch with Republican Donald Trump. Biden bowed out.

But it's the first and final chapters that bring a new element to the Pelosi era, detailing in personal and painstaking ways the toll that America's violent strain is taking on civic life and public service.

""I don't know that we will ever feel safe,"" she writes.

Written well before the July assassination attempt on Trump, Pelosi's assessment of the nation's dangerous discourse arrives after back-to-back congressional shootings of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise and earlier of Democratic former Rep. Gabby Giffords, and it serves as a walk-off warning in what could be among her final years in Congress.

Pelosi recounts her disbelief at being ""pulled off the Speaker's platform"" and out of the House chamber by security the afternoon of Jan. 6 as rioters sent by Trump stormed through the halls, some searching for her.

""I can handle it,"" she protested, telling U.S. Capitol Police she wanted to stay and finish the work as Congress was certifying the 2020 election.

""Their response was curt,"" she writes. ""'No, you can't.'""

After being whisked away to safety at Fort McNair, she writes about huddling with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the three of them desperately calling the Pentagon to send National Guard troops to restore order at the Capitol. She describes House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump loyalist, as almost entirely unseen.

So worried about the rioters' threats against Vice President Mike Pence in hiding at the Capitol, she called and told him, ""Don't let anybody know where you are.""

""It still took three hours from the time I was dragged out of the House chamber for the Guard to arrive at the Capitol complex,"" she writes. ""It took about three and a half hours to clear the rioters from the building.""

Later, surveying the wreckage of broken glass and splintered wood, she was told of blood outside the Speaker's Lobby. In some places, including her office, the mob had ""literally defecated on the floors and rugs,"" she wrote. ""What was left behind was pure destruction.""

She recalled being in war zones, and in Kyiv at the start of the Russian invasion thinking she may well die in Ukraine. ""I briefly thought the same on January 6,"" she wrote.

""When I became Speaker, I knew that I was making myself into a target,"" she writes. ""However, our accepting the risk is something that is fundamentally different for our families.""

Not quite two years later, she was awakened in the middle of the night by the ""Knock. Knock. Knock. Pound, Pound. Pound,"" of the Capitol Police security detail at her door in Washington.

Pelosi recounts the dizzying hours, frantic family phone calls and flight back to San Francisco, the hospital, the surgeries and the long recovery for her husband. Their youngest daughter said he looked like a bandaged-up Frankenstein.

Her son, Paul Jr., went to the family's home to vacuum up the broken glass and clean up the blood. Her daughter Alexandra, who had been a high schooler when Pelosi first ran for Congress, told her, had she known what they were signing up for she would ""never have given you my blessing.""

The attacker was tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. But Pelosi writes, the story of Paul's attack would not go away.

""Our home remains a heartbreaking crime scene,"" she wrote.

Pelosi said her children told her that for a long time Paul would only sleep in the bedroom when she was there. He still suffers from headaches and dizzy spells, and she said she has seen him faint and fall twice from vertigo. As of February, she wrote, she was still changing bandages from surgery on his arm.

But the ""true horror"" she writes was the dehumanizing jokes by Republicans from Trump on down, including the former president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who posted a Paul Pelosi Halloween costume to social media, and the way the crowds would ""laugh, cheer, and applaud"" their cruel remarks.

""It made me profoundly sad for our country,"" she writes.

Pelosi situates the two bloody episodes in the arc of her career, from the way Republicans vilified her in countless campaign ads from the time she first rose as Democratic leader to the way protesters spit on Democrats, including civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, the day the House voted for the Affordable Care Act, to the severed pig's head left outside her family's home in the days before Jan. 6.

Unbeknownst to most Americans, that term, ""learned helplessness,"" was profoundly and inextricably tied to this country's disastrous post-9/11 Global War on Terror and, in particular, its horrifying torture program. Yet there it was, being used in a new context -- one that, while perhaps altered by the president's recent decision not to run for a second term, has been employed with remarkable frequency in the intervening months, especially recently, when it comes to this country's presidential future.

As the pundits weighed in on Joe Biden's abysmal performance at that June 27th debate with Donald Trump and cast doubt on his prospects for reelection, ""learned helplessness"" was used over and over again in the days leading up to his withdrawal from the presidential race in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris. Two days after the debate, for instance, The Economist, focusing on Biden's refusal to declare himself a non-candidate for the presidency, concluded that ""many [Democrats] have fallen into learned helplessness,"" as evidenced by the gap between their private doubts and their public assertions.

Writing for the San Francisco-based progressive daily, 48hills, Bruce Mirkin chastised the Democrats for choosing hopelessness over hope. ""Instead of 'yes, we can,'"" he wrote, ""the instinctive response from a good portion of the folks who should be helping to defend democracy seems to be 'no, we can't.'"" He then labeled the party's inaction ""learned helplessness."" Jordan Zakarin, writing for the Center for American Progress Action's Progress Report, extended that diagnosis from ""the worst debate performance in modern history"" to the larger moment in Washington. He pointed, for instance, to Attorney General Merrick Garland having ""slow-walked prosecuting Donald Trump."" ""It is,"" he concluded, ""a learned helplessness,"" a ""preemptive surrender.""

The question is: What should we make of the concept of ""learned helplessness""? Where did it come from and what are the remedies writ large? In this distinctly disturbing moment in our history, is it possible that an all-American version of despair and hopelessness has changed in light of Joe Biden's backing out of the presidential race?

The Psychological Concept

To better understand the sudden shower of references to ""learned helplessness,"" a little history is in order. In the late 1960s, psychologist Martin Seligman coined the term while conducting experiments with dogs. He had accidentally stumbled on the fact that dogs that experienced electrical shocks without having any control over starting or stopping them were ultimately rendered strangely passive. They proved unwilling to move, even to escape further mistreatment.

After more experiments demonstrated that being subjected to severe pain or stress did indeed induce a state of inaction in dogs, Seligman then turned to humans and discovered that individuals who had suffered an act or acts of trauma and abuse continued, well after the painful incident, to show signs of depression and anxiety that rendered them completely unable to act. They continued to exist, he discovered, in a state of profound resignation and inaction, long after the traumatic moment in which they found themselves powerless. Afterward, they were convinced that nothing was under their control, that any action they might take would be futile, and that failure was inevitable, should they even try to act. (Later studies suggested that some elderly individuals might also experience such a state of profound resignation and inaction in response to ""stressful life events,"" at times in association with dementia.)

But here's the truly strange thing: more than three decades later in the years after the 9/11 attacks, Seligman's concept of ""learned helplessness"" would be quite purposely baked into the interrogation and torture program created and implemented for war on terror detainees by American officials during the administration of President George W. Bush. As the executive summary of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's torture report explained, one of the two psychologists contracted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for the purpose of devising its interrogation program ""had reviewed research on 'learned helplessness,' in which individuals might become passive and depressed in response to adverse or uncontrollable events. He theorized,"" the report added, ""that inducing such a state could encourage a detainee to cooperate and provide information.""

That psychologist, Bruce Mitchell, even met with Seligman while designing techniques to use on war-on-terror detainees suspected of ties to the 9/11 terror group al-Qaeda and its leadership at the secret ""black sites"" the CIA set up globally. (Seligman, it seems, had no idea of the horrors Mitchell and his associates were planning.) Ironically enough, Seligman's findings and his concept of ""learned helplessness"" would indeed become a basic part of the development of the CIA's torture program. (Seligman would come to condemn the use of the concept for interrogations at those black sites. As The Washington Post reported, ""When [Seligman] later learned through media accounts how it was employed -- for enhanced interrogation -- he issued a statement: 'I am grieved and horrified that good science, which has helped so many people overcome depression, may have been used for such bad purposes.'"")

To induce a profound state of helplessness, those post-9/11 captives were sent to the CIA's black sites where they were subjected to ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" designed to elicit information from them. Their torture included beatings, being smashed into walls, being hung by their limbs in excruciatingly painful positions, forced nudity, sodomy, and repeated sleep deprivation, among other things. The CIA also used waterboarding (subjecting detainees to the feeling of drowning), placed them in coffin-like boxes, and threatened to use a gun or a power drill on those who refused to give answers sought by their interrogators. Just last month, in a pre-trial hearing at the forever prison the Bush administration set up offshore -- and away from the federal court system -- at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, in 2002, such techniques were once again described in detail, this time by John Bruce Jessen, the psychologist who, along with Mitchell, designed the nightmarish interrogation program. In addition to his testimony, he also demonstrated the technique of ""walling,"" which involved slamming a detainee's head against a wall.

The goal was simple: to reduce that prisoner to a profound state of complete paralysis and disempowerment in which, having no hope of relief or escape, he would do whatever his captors wanted. Detainees would see that there was no way out but to answer their captors' questions, which, it turned out, often led them, in desperation and a state of learned helplessness, to confess to things they hadn't done, to confess to whatever their captors wanted to hear.

Having studied and written about the nightmare of those prisoners and Guantánamo for so many years now, it's been supremely jarring to see the term ""learned helplessness"" re-emerge in connection to the current unnerving state of American politics and the 2024 presidential election. Yet, in many ways, it seems a strangely appropriate lens through which to view the world of Donald Trump and the rest of us. It was true, as many commented, that a sense of learned helplessness indisputably crept into the mindset of so many of us in this country -- at least prior to Joe Biden's decision not to pursue a second term as president.

The American people have indeed suffered multiple stressful, even traumatic experiences in recent years. The shock of a government that didn't protect them on September 11, 2001; the devastating experience of a president who refused to protect them from Covid, as bodies piled up on the streets of this country; the winnowing away of rights and liberties once protected by the Constitution and the Supreme Court -- from the overturning of Roe v. Wade to a rash of recent decisions, including one that gave a president essential immunity in relation to more or less anything he did, no matter how devastating; the inability of the courts to proceed in their prosecutions of Donald Trump; the nearly paralyzed state of a riven Congress amid an economic reality that has led so many younger Americans to be unable to purchase their own homes or send their children to college -- all have collectively cowed the population. Even before both the Supreme Court's presidential immunity decision and the dismal debate performance of Biden, a sense of learned helplessness seemed well in place, and understandably so.

The Republican Party has also succumbed to a state of learned helplessness. One after another, former opponents of Trump and the MAGA ideology he stands for have succumbed to his agenda and given up on pursuing their own independent goals. Republican vice-presidential nominee J.D. Vance is certainly a case in point. Having formerly called out Trump for his lack of morality, his xenophobia, and his racism, as well as for being a ""total fraud"" and ""America's Hitler,"" he is now on board with the ideas he once said he deplored, including, for example, an untethered anti-immigration stance that calls for massive deportations of illegal immigrants. Similarly, Trump's Republican election opponent Nikki Haley has given up her ""legacy of blunt assessments and brutal takedowns"" of the former president, as The Nation's John Nichols has aptly described her opposition to Trump, whom she once described as ""a dangerous stooge of Russian president Vladimir Putin.""

The question is: What, if anything, does the research tell us about curing such a state?

Is There, in Fact, a Cure?

Psychologists do point to remedies for such a profound state of hopelessness. They suggest several healing paths forward, including therapy to examine the causes of one's despair and to discover constructive paths beyond it; exercise to stimulate the body and the mind; and a commitment to ""learned optimism,"" a pattern of reaction geared to expecting the best rather than the worst out of any situation. As Psychology Today points out, ""Seligman later developed the concept of learned optimism. By explaining events to ourselves in a constructive manner and developing a positive internal dialogue, people can break free from their cycle of helplessness."" Small wins and an energized commitment to positivity are basic tenets of finding a way to ""learned optimism.""

If a turn towards optimism offers a way out of the helplessness of our times, perhaps we are seeing the beginning of just such an event. Recently, Slate's Dahlia Lithwick, again invoking the term ""learned helplessness,"" suggested that reports of the plans of the Biden administration to back Supreme Court reform were a sign of the kind of future ""systemwide cognitive reboot for American voters that seems almost inconceivable in the generalized torpor and despair of July 2024."" The headline of her article read, appropriately enough, ""Are We Finally Letting Go of Our Learned-Helplessness Syndrome Around the Supreme Court?""

So, too, the outpouring of energy and excitement following Biden's decision to bow out of the presidential race and the enthusiasm for newer, younger Democratic Party leadership -- and for Vice President Kamala Harris, in particular -- already seems eons removed from the head-shaking resignation of Democratic voters confronting a ""choice"" between an aging Joe Biden and You Know Who on election day. In fact, in many ways, that new turn of affairs could be just what the doctor ordered, though, of course, a possible November election victory for Donald Trump could still put the phrase ""learned helplessness"" in a grimly new light.

For Democrats, the idea that there could be a brighter future, one in which a sense of control replaced one of powerlessness -- an election in which their presidential candidate has a viable chance of winning -- has taken hold. In place of anxiety and depression, there is optimism, or at least a ""cautious hope."" Declaring her ""immense pride and limitless optimism for our country's future,"" Nancy Pelosi echoed the importance of this newfound optimism when endorsing Kamala Harris as the party's candidate for 2024. As Tim Alberta summed it up in The Atlantic, ""As far back as springtime, the numbers told a straightforward story: Biden was not going to win. Democrats could only look on, powerless."" However, now, he concludes, it is the Republicans who are feeling hope and control fade away: ""Sunday brought an unfamiliar feeling of powerlessness. For the first time in a long time, Trump does not control the narrative of 2024.""

Whether or not such optimism gains momentum in the potentially tumultuous days ahead remains to be seen, as does whether the Republicans can find a way out of their own potential sense of learned helplessness in the face of a changing scenario. Whatever happens, given what I know about the past use of that phrase and the nightmare of the war on terror's use of torture, my own hope is that, with election 2024, the very concept of learned helplessness and the realities it represents, whether it applies to torture at the hands of the U.S. government or suffering at the hands of Trumpian politics, can finally be politically laid to rest.

Call it learned optimism, if you wish, but fingers crossed.",[],,-0.2784,460619499,13,conservativeangle.com,news,Brigitte Gabriel,,2024-08-06

Slow-moving Tropical Storm Debby bringing torrential rains, major flood threat to southeastern US

HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby has moved menacingly into some of America's most historic Southern cities in what is expected to be a prolonged event of torrential downpours and flooding after slamming into Florida with heavy rain and high winds. Record-setting rain from the storm that killed at least five people on Monday was causing flash flooding in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Savannah Mayor Van Johnson told residents Monday night to hunker down and expect a rough day on Tuesday. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida Monday as a Category 1 hurricane.

Bangladesh protesters want Nobel Peace Prize laureate Yunus to lead country after Hasina's departure

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- A key organizer of Bangladesh's student protests says Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is their choice as head of an interim government a day after the longtime Prime Minister Sheik Hasina resigned. The country's figurehead president and the military chief said Monday that an interim government would be formed soon. Nahid Islam, the organizer, in a video post in social media said Tuesday the student protest leaders have already talked with Yunus, who consented to take over. Islam said the student protesters would announce more names for the government, and it would be a difficult challenge for the current leadership to ignore their choices.

Japan's share benchmark soars nearly 11% a day after massive sell-offs that shook Wall Street

NEW YORK (AP) -- Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index has soared more than 10% a day after it set markets tumbling in Europe and on Wall Street, while other world markets appeared to have settled after the rollercoaster ride that started the week. The Japanese index fell back after its biggest early advance, gaining 8.7% by midmorning on Tuesday. On Monday, nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as world markets quaked under fears the U.S. economy is slowing too much. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed the Nikkei's 12.4% plunge, its worst since 1987.

Proxy forces armed by Iran could take part in retaliation against Israel over Hamas leader's killing

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- As Iran threatens to respond to the suspected Israeli assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, the regional militias that the Islamic Republic has armed for decades could play a role in any attack. They include Lebanon's Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels of Yemen, Shiite militias in Iraq and others. Those relationships are managed by Iran's powerful paramilitary organization, the Revolutionary Guard. Iran relies on those proxy forces as international sanctions on Tehran, including over its nuclear program, have kept it from receiving advanced weaponry. While developing its own missile program, Iran also relies on militias as an asymmetric threat to squeeze Israel and the United States.

Venezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo ""falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council"" and they openly incited ""police and military officials to disobey the laws.""

Google illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge has ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Witnesses will tell a federal safety board about the blowout on a Boeing 737 Max earlier this year

The National Transportation Safety Board is about to hold a two-day hearing into the blowout of a panel from the side of a Boeing 737 Max airliner. The safety board's hearing starts Tuesday in Washington, D.C. It will hear from witnesses including its own investigators who have been looking into the Jan. 5 accident that occurred during an Alaska Airlines flight. The board is calling it a fact-finding hearing. The NTSB will not vote on a probable cause for the accident. That step probably won't happen for another year or longer after more investigation.

Hiroshima governor says nuclear disarmament must be tackled as a pressing issue, not an ideal

TOKYO (AP) -- Hiroshima officials are urging world leaders to stop relying on nuclear weapons as deterrence and take immediate action toward abolishment -- not as an ideal, but to remove the risk of atomic war amid the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. They commented Tuesday as the city remembered its atomic bombing 79 years ago at the end of World War II. The memorial comes days after Japan and the U.S. reaffirmed Washington's commitment to ""extended deterrence,"" including atomic weapons, to protect its Asian ally. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has vowed to do his utmost to pursue ""realistic and practical measures"" to build global momentum for nuclear disarmament. Critics say it is a hollow promise.

Not quite two years later, the threat of political violence would come for her husband at their home.

""Where's Nancy? Where's Nancy?""

That was the chilling question the intruder posed to Paul Pelosi before bludgeoning the then-82-year-old over the head with a hammer in their San Francisco house. It echoed the menacing jeers of the rioters roaming the halls of the Capitol calling out ""Nancy, Nancy"" on Jan. 6.

The through line of escalating political rhetoric and violence in American public life serves as the opening and closing message of Pelosi's new book, ""The Art of Power, My Story as America's First Woman Speaker of the House.""

Pelosi recounts her nearly four-decade legislative record in Congress but also allows a rare public glimpse into the private devastation around the assault on her husband. With it, she delivers a grave warning that the casual mockery and mimicry of political violence in America is chasing a generation from public service.

She twice won the speakers gavel, worked alongside seven presidents and, more recently, played a pivotal role in quietly convincing President Joe Biden to reassess his decision to remain in the 2024 presidential election rematch with Republican Donald Trump. Biden bowed out.

But it's the first and final chapters that bring a new element to the Pelosi era, detailing in personal and painstaking ways the toll that America's violent strain is taking on civic life and public service.

""I don't know that we will ever feel safe,"" she writes.

Written well before the July assassination attempt on Trump, Pelosi's assessment of the nation's dangerous discourse arrives after back-to-back congressional shootings of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise and earlier of Democratic former Rep. Gabby Giffords, and it serves as a walk-off warning in what could be among her final years in Congress.

Pelosi recounts her disbelief at being ""pulled off the Speaker's platform"" and out of the House chamber by security the afternoon of Jan. 6 as rioters sent by Trump stormed through the halls, some searching for her.

""I can handle it,"" she protested, telling U.S. Capitol Police she wanted to stay and finish the work as Congress was certifying the 2020 election.

""Their response was curt,"" she writes. ""'No, you can't.'""

After being whisked away to safety at Fort McNair, she writes about huddling with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the three of them desperately calling the Pentagon to send National Guard troops to restore order at the Capitol. She describes House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump loyalist, as almost entirely unseen.

So worried about the rioters' threats against Vice President Mike Pence in hiding at the Capitol, she called and told him, ""Don't let anybody know where you are.""

""It still took three hours from the time I was dragged out of the House chamber for the Guard to arrive at the Capitol complex,"" she writes. ""It took about three and a half hours to clear the rioters from the building.""

Later, surveying the wreckage of broken glass and splintered wood, she was told of blood outside the Speaker's Lobby. In some places, including her office, the mob had ""literally defecated on the floors and rugs,"" she wrote. ""What was left behind was pure destruction.""

She recalled being in war zones, and in Kyiv at the start of the Russian invasion thinking she may well die in Ukraine. ""I briefly thought the same on January 6,"" she wrote.

""When I became Speaker, I knew that I was making myself into a target,"" she writes. ""However, our accepting the risk is something that is fundamentally different for our families.""

Not quite two years later, she was awakened in the middle of the night by the ""Knock. Knock. Knock. Pound, Pound. Pound,"" of the Capitol Police security detail at her door in Washington.

""The officers' expressions were grim,"" she writes.

""It's Mr. Pelosi. He's been attacked in your home.""

""Is he okay?""

""We don't know.""

""Is he alive?""

""We don't know.""

Pelosi recounts the dizzying hours, frantic family phone calls and flight back to San Francisco, the hospital, the surgeries and the long recovery for her husband. Their youngest daughter said he looked like a bandaged-up Frankenstein.

Her son, Paul Jr., went to the family's home to vacuum up the broken glass and clean up the blood. Her daughter Alexandra, who had been a high schooler when Pelosi first ran for Congress, told her, had she known what they were signing up for she would ""never have given you my blessing.""

The attacker was tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. But Pelosi writes, the story of Paul's attack would not go away.

""Our home remains a heartbreaking crime scene,"" she wrote.

Pelosi said her children told her that for a long time Paul would only sleep in the bedroom when she was there. He still suffers from headaches and dizzy spells, and she said she has seen him faint and fall twice from vertigo. As of February, she wrote, she was still changing bandages from surgery on his arm.

But the ""true horror"" she writes was the dehumanizing jokes by Republicans from Trump on down, including the former president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who posted a Paul Pelosi Halloween costume to social media, and the way the crowds would ""laugh, cheer, and applaud"" their cruel remarks.

""It made me profoundly sad for our country,"" she writes.

Pelosi situates the two bloody episodes in the arc of her career, from the way Republicans vilified her in countless campaign ads from the time she first rose as Democratic leader to the way protesters spit on Democrats, including civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, the day the House voted for the Affordable Care Act, to the severed pig's head left outside her family's home in the days before Jan. 6.

Pelosi writes that when she speaks to young people about running for office, ""especially young women, too often I hear their reluctance to put their families in harm's way.""

Steve Scalise and earlier of former Democrat Gabby Giffords, and it serves as a warning of a departure in what could be one of her last years in Congress.

Pelosi has recounted her disbelief as she was ""dragged"" from the speaker's dais by security and escorted out of the House chamber on the afternoon of January 6, as rioters sent by Trump stormed through the halls, some searching for her.

""I can handle it,"" she protested, telling U.S. Capitol Police she wanted to stay and finish the job while Congress certifies the 2020 election.

""Their response was curt,"" she writes. ""'No, that's not possible.'""

After being taken to safety at Fort McNair, she writes about her meeting with Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, all three of whom desperately called on the Pentagon to send in National Guard troops to restore order to the Capitol. She describes Republican House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump loyalist, as almost completely invisible.

She was so concerned about the rioters' threats against Vice President Mike Pence, who was hiding in the Capitol, that she called him and told him, ""Don't let anyone know where you are.""

""It still took three hours from the time I was dragged out of the House chamber before the Guard arrived at the Capitol complex,"" she wrote. ""It took approximately three and a half hours to get the rioters out of the building.""

Later, as she surveyed the mess of broken glass and splintered wood, she was told there was blood outside the chairman's lobby. In some places, including her office, the mob had ""literally defecated on the floors and carpets,"" she wrote. ""What was left behind was pure destruction.""

She remembered being in war zones and in Kiev at the beginning of the Russian invasion, thinking she might die in Ukraine. ""I thought the same thing for a moment on January 6,"" she wrote.

""When I became Speaker, I knew I was making myself a target,"" she writes. ""But accepting the risk is something fundamentally different for our families.""

Less than two years later, she was awakened in the middle of the night by the ""Knock. Knock. Knock. Pound, Pound. Pound"" of Capitol Police security at her door in Washington.

""The officers' facial expressions were grim,"" she writes.

Pelosi recounts the dizzying hours, frantic family phone calls, the flight back to San Francisco, the hospital, the surgeries and the long recovery for her husband. Their youngest daughter said he looked like a bandaged Frankenstein.

Her son, Paul Jr., went to the family's home to vacuum up the broken glass and clean up the blood. Her daughter Alexandra, who was in high school when Pelosi first ran for Congress, told her that if she had known what they were running for, ""I never would have given you my blessing.""

The attacker was tried, convicted, and sentenced to prison. But Pelosi writes that the story of Paul's attack would not go away.

""Our home is still a heartbreaking crime scene,"" she wrote.

Pelosi said her children told her that Paul slept alone in the bedroom for long periods of time when she was there. He still suffers from headaches and dizziness, and she said she has seen him faint and fall twice from dizziness. In February, she wrote, she was still changing bandages after surgery on his arm.

But the ""real horror,"" she writes, was the dehumanizing jokes made by Republicans from Trump on down, including the former president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who posted a Halloween costume of Paul Pelosi on social media, and the way the crowd ""laughed, cheered and applauded"" their cruel comments.

""It made me deeply sad for our country,"" she wrote.

Pelosi places the two bloody episodes within the span of her career, from the way Republicans smeared her in countless campaign ads from the moment she first became Democratic leader to the way protesters spat on Democrats, including civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, the day the House voted to pass the Affordable Care Act to the severed pig's head left outside her family's home in the days leading up to Jan. 6.

Pelosi writes that when she speaks to young people about running for political office, ""particularly young women, I too often hear their reluctance to put their families at risk.""

""This is not how our country should be. If you go into government service, you should not be a target, and your family should not be a target.""",[],https://nybreaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pelosi-warns-in-her-new-book-that-political-threats-and.jpg,-0.3647,460617680,1,nybreaking.com,news,NY Breaking News,eng-9790220,2024-08-06

Slow-moving Tropical Storm Debby bringing torrential rains, major flood threat to southeastern US

HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby has moved menacingly into some of America's most historic Southern cities in what is expected to be a prolonged event of torrential downpours and flooding after slamming into Florida with heavy rain and high winds. Record-setting rain from the storm that killed at least five people on Monday was causing flash flooding in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Savannah Mayor Van Johnson told residents Monday night to hunker down and expect a rough day on Tuesday. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida Monday as a Category 1 hurricane.

Bangladesh protesters want Nobel Peace Prize laureate Yunus to lead country after Hasina's departure

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- A key organizer of Bangladesh's student protests says Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is their choice as head of an interim government a day after the longtime Prime Minister Sheik Hasina resigned. The country's figurehead president and the military chief said Monday that an interim government would be formed soon. Nahid Islam, the organizer, in a video post in social media said Tuesday the student protest leaders have already talked with Yunus, who consented to take over. Islam said the student protesters would announce more names for the government, and it would be a difficult challenge for the current leadership to ignore their choices.

Japan's share benchmark soars nearly 11% a day after massive sell-offs that shook Wall Street

NEW YORK (AP) -- Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index has soared more than 10% a day after it set markets tumbling in Europe and on Wall Street, while other world markets appeared to have settled after the rollercoaster ride that started the week. The Japanese index fell back after its biggest early advance, gaining 8.7% by midmorning on Tuesday. On Monday, nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as world markets quaked under fears the U.S. economy is slowing too much. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed the Nikkei's 12.4% plunge, its worst since 1987.

Proxy forces armed by Iran could take part in retaliation against Israel over Hamas leader's killing

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- As Iran threatens to respond to the suspected Israeli assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, the regional militias that the Islamic Republic has armed for decades could play a role in any attack. They include Lebanon's Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels of Yemen, Shiite militias in Iraq and others. Those relationships are managed by Iran's powerful paramilitary organization, the Revolutionary Guard. Iran relies on those proxy forces as international sanctions on Tehran, including over its nuclear program, have kept it from receiving advanced weaponry. While developing its own missile program, Iran also relies on militias as an asymmetric threat to squeeze Israel and the United States.

Venezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo ""falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council"" and they openly incited ""police and military officials to disobey the laws.""

Google illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge has ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Witnesses will tell a federal safety board about the blowout on a Boeing 737 Max earlier this year

The National Transportation Safety Board is about to hold a two-day hearing into the blowout of a panel from the side of a Boeing 737 Max airliner. The safety board's hearing starts Tuesday in Washington, D.C. It will hear from witnesses including its own investigators who have been looking into the Jan. 5 accident that occurred during an Alaska Airlines flight. The board is calling it a fact-finding hearing. The NTSB will not vote on a probable cause for the accident. That step probably won't happen for another year or longer after more investigation.

Hiroshima governor says nuclear disarmament must be tackled as a pressing issue, not an ideal

TOKYO (AP) -- Hiroshima officials are urging world leaders to stop relying on nuclear weapons as deterrence and take immediate action toward abolishment -- not as an ideal, but to remove the risk of atomic war amid the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. They commented Tuesday as the city remembered its atomic bombing 79 years ago at the end of World War II. The memorial comes days after Japan and the U.S. reaffirmed Washington's commitment to ""extended deterrence,"" including atomic weapons, to protect its Asian ally. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has vowed to do his utmost to pursue ""realistic and practical measures"" to build global momentum for nuclear disarmament. Critics say it is a hollow promise.

Unbeknownst to most Americans, that term, ""learned helplessness,"" was profoundly and inextricably tied to this country's disastrous post-9/11 Global War on Terror and, in particular, its horrifying torture program. Yet there it was, being used in a new context -- one that, while perhaps altered by the president's recent decision not to run for a second term, has been employed with remarkable frequency in the intervening months, especially recently, when it comes to this country's presidential future.

As the pundits weighed in on Joe Biden's abysmal performance at that June 27th debate with Donald Trump and cast doubt on his prospects for reelection, ""learned helplessness"" was used over and over again in the days leading up to his withdrawal from the presidential race in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris. Two days after the debate, for instance, The Economist, focusing on Biden's refusal to declare himself a non-candidate for the presidency, concluded that ""many [Democrats] have fallen into learned helplessness,"" as evidenced by the gap between their private doubts and their public assertions.

Writing for the San Francisco-based progressive daily, 48hills, Bruce Mirkin chastised the Democrats for choosing hopelessness over hope. ""Instead of 'yes, we can,'"" he wrote, ""the instinctive response from a good portion of the folks who should be helping to defend democracy seems to be 'no, we can't.'"" He then labeled the party's inaction ""learned helplessness."" Jordan Zakarin, writing for the Center for American Progress Action's Progress Report, extended that diagnosis from ""the worst debate performance in modern history"" to the larger moment in Washington. He pointed, for instance, to Attorney General Merrick Garland having ""slow-walked prosecuting Donald Trump."" ""It is,"" he concluded, ""a learned helplessness,"" a ""preemptive surrender.""

The question is: What should we make of the concept of ""learned helplessness""? Where did it come from and what are the remedies writ large? In this distinctly disturbing moment in our history, is it possible that an all-American version of despair and hopelessness has changed in light of Joe Biden's backing out of the presidential race?

The Psychological Concept

To better understand the sudden shower of references to ""learned helplessness,"" a little history is in order. In the late 1960s, psychologist Martin Seligman coined the term while conducting experiments with dogs. He had accidentally stumbled on the fact that dogs that experienced electrical shocks without having any control over starting or stopping them were ultimately rendered strangely passive. They proved unwilling to move, even to escape further mistreatment.

After more experiments demonstrated that being subjected to severe pain or stress did indeed induce a state of inaction in dogs, Seligman then turned to humans and discovered that individuals who had suffered an act or acts of trauma and abuse continued, well after the painful incident, to show signs of depression and anxiety that rendered them completely unable to act. They continued to exist, he discovered, in a state of profound resignation and inaction, long after the traumatic moment in which they found themselves powerless. Afterward, they were convinced that nothing was under their control, that any action they might take would be futile, and that failure was inevitable, should they even try to act. (Later studies suggested that some elderly individuals might also experience such a state of profound resignation and inaction in response to ""stressful life events,"" at times in association with dementia.)

But here's the truly strange thing: more than three decades later in the years after the 9/11 attacks, Seligman's concept of ""learned helplessness"" would be quite purposely baked into the interrogation and torture program created and implemented for war on terror detainees by American officials during the administration of President George W. Bush. As the executive summary of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's torture report explained, one of the two psychologists contracted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for the purpose of devising its interrogation program ""had reviewed research on 'learned helplessness,' in which individuals might become passive and depressed in response to adverse or uncontrollable events. He theorized,"" the report added, ""that inducing such a state could encourage a detainee to cooperate and provide information.""

That psychologist, Bruce Mitchell, even met with Seligman while designing techniques to use on war-on-terror detainees suspected of ties to the 9/11 terror group al-Qaeda and its leadership at the secret ""black sites"" the CIA set up globally. (Seligman, it seems, had no idea of the horrors Mitchell and his associates were planning.) Ironically enough, Seligman's findings and his concept of ""learned helplessness"" would indeed become a basic part of the development of the CIA's torture program. (Seligman would come to condemn the use of the concept for interrogations at those black sites. As The Washington Post reported, ""When [Seligman] later learned through media accounts how it was employed -- for enhanced interrogation -- he issued a statement: 'I am grieved and horrified that good science, which has helped so many people overcome depression, may have been used for such bad purposes.'"")

To induce a profound state of helplessness, those post-9/11 captives were sent to the CIA's black sites where they were subjected to ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" designed to elicit information from them. Their torture included beatings, being smashed into walls, being hung by their limbs in excruciatingly painful positions, forced nudity, sodomy, and repeated sleep deprivation, among other things. The CIA also used waterboarding (subjecting detainees to the feeling of drowning), placed them in coffin-like boxes, and threatened to use a gun or a power drill on those who refused to give answers sought by their interrogators. Just last month, in a pre-trial hearing at the forever prison the Bush administration set up offshore -- and away from the federal court system -- at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, in 2002, such techniques were once again described in detail, this time by John Bruce Jessen, the psychologist who, along with Mitchell, designed the nightmarish interrogation program. In addition to his testimony, he also demonstrated the technique of ""walling,"" which involved slamming a detainee's head against a wall.

The goal was simple: to reduce that prisoner to a profound state of complete paralysis and disempowerment in which, having no hope of relief or escape, he would do whatever his captors wanted. Detainees would see that there was no way out but to answer their captors' questions, which, it turned out, often led them, in desperation and a state of learned helplessness, to confess to things they hadn't done, to confess to whatever their captors wanted to hear.

Having studied and written about the nightmare of those prisoners and Guantánamo for so many years now, it's been supremely jarring to see the term ""learned helplessness"" re-emerge in connection to the current unnerving state of American politics and the 2024 presidential election. Yet, in many ways, it seems a strangely appropriate lens through which to view the world of Donald Trump and the rest of us. It was true, as many commented, that a sense of learned helplessness indisputably crept into the mindset of so many of us in this country -- at least prior to Joe Biden's decision not to pursue a second term as president.

The American people have indeed suffered multiple stressful, even traumatic experiences in recent years. The shock of a government that didn't protect them on September 11, 2001; the devastating experience of a president who refused to protect them from Covid, as bodies piled up on the streets of this country; the winnowing away of rights and liberties once protected by the Constitution and the Supreme Court -- from the overturning of Roe v. Wade to a rash of recent decisions, including one that gave a president essential immunity in relation to more or less anything he did, no matter how devastating; the inability of the courts to proceed in their prosecutions of Donald Trump; the nearly paralyzed state of a riven Congress amid an economic reality that has led so many younger Americans to be unable to purchase their own homes or send their children to college -- all have collectively cowed the population. Even before both the Supreme Court's presidential immunity decision and the dismal debate performance of Biden, a sense of learned helplessness seemed well in place, and understandably so.

The Republican Party has also succumbed to a state of learned helplessness. One after another, former opponents of Trump and the MAGA ideology he stands for have succumbed to his agenda and given up on pursuing their own independent goals. Republican vice-presidential nominee J.D. Vance is certainly a case in point. Having formerly called out Trump for his lack of morality, his xenophobia, and his racism, as well as for being a ""total fraud"" and ""America's Hitler,"" he is now on board with the ideas he once said he deplored, including, for example, an untethered anti-immigration stance that calls for massive deportations of illegal immigrants. Similarly, Trump's Republican election opponent Nikki Haley has given up her ""legacy of blunt assessments and brutal takedowns"" of the former president, as The Nation's John Nichols has aptly described her opposition to Trump, whom she once described as ""a dangerous stooge of Russian president Vladimir Putin.""

The question is: What, if anything, does the research tell us about curing such a state?

Is There, in Fact, a Cure?

Psychologists do point to remedies for such a profound state of hopelessness. They suggest several healing paths forward, including therapy to examine the causes of one's despair and to discover constructive paths beyond it; exercise to stimulate the body and the mind; and a commitment to ""learned optimism,"" a pattern of reaction geared to expecting the best rather than the worst out of any situation. As Psychology Today points out, ""Seligman later developed the concept of learned optimism. By explaining events to ourselves in a constructive manner and developing a positive internal dialogue, people can break free from their cycle of helplessness."" Small wins and an energized commitment to positivity are basic tenets of finding a way to ""learned optimism.""

If a turn towards optimism offers a way out of the helplessness of our times, perhaps we are seeing the beginning of just such an event. Recently, Slate's Dahlia Lithwick, again invoking the term ""learned helplessness,"" suggested that reports of the plans of the Biden administration to back Supreme Court reform were a sign of the kind of future ""systemwide cognitive reboot for American voters that seems almost inconceivable in the generalized torpor and despair of July 2024."" The headline of her article read, appropriately enough, ""Are We Finally Letting Go of Our Learned-Helplessness Syndrome Around the Supreme Court?""

So, too, the outpouring of energy and excitement following Biden's decision to bow out of the presidential race and the enthusiasm for newer, younger Democratic Party leadership -- and for Vice President Kamala Harris, in particular -- already seems eons removed from the head-shaking resignation of Democratic voters confronting a ""choice"" between an aging Joe Biden and You Know Who on election day. In fact, in many ways, that new turn of affairs could be just what the doctor ordered, though, of course, a possible November election victory for Donald Trump could still put the phrase ""learned helplessness"" in a grimly new light.

For Democrats, the idea that there could be a brighter future, one in which a sense of control replaced one of powerlessness -- an election in which their presidential candidate has a viable chance of winning -- has taken hold. In place of anxiety and depression, there is optimism, or at least a ""cautious hope."" Declaring her ""immense pride and limitless optimism for our country's future,"" Nancy Pelosi echoed the importance of this newfound optimism when endorsing Kamala Harris as the party's candidate for 2024. As Tim Alberta summed it up in The Atlantic, ""As far back as springtime, the numbers told a straightforward story: Biden was not going to win. Democrats could only look on, powerless."" However, now, he concludes, it is the Republicans who are feeling hope and control fade away: ""Sunday brought an unfamiliar feeling of powerlessness. For the first time in a long time, Trump does not control the narrative of 2024.""

Whether or not such optimism gains momentum in the potentially tumultuous days ahead remains to be seen, as does whether the Republicans can find a way out of their own potential sense of learned helplessness in the face of a changing scenario. Whatever happens, given what I know about the past use of that phrase and the nightmare of the war on terror's use of torture, my own hope is that, with election 2024, the very concept of learned helplessness and the realities it represents, whether it applies to torture at the hands of the U.S. government or suffering at the hands of Trumpian politics, can finally be politically laid to rest.

Call it learned optimism, if you wish, but fingers crossed.",[],https://lrc-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/2021/02/LRC-share.jpg,-0.2784,460617220,13,lewrockwell.com,news,Lew Rockwell,,2024-08-06

""Where's Nancy? Where's Nancy?""

That was the chilling question the intruder posed to Paul Pelosi before bludgeoning the then-82-year-old over the head with a hammer in their San Francisco house. It echoed the menacing jeers of the rioters roaming the halls of the Capitol calling out ""Nancy, Nancy"" on Jan. 6.

The through line of escalating political rhetoric and violence in American public life serves as the opening and closing message of Pelosi's new book, ""The Art of Power, My Story as America's First Woman Speaker of the House.""

Pelosi recounts her nearly four-decade legislative record in Congress but also allows a rare public glimpse into the private devastation around the assault on her husband. With it, she delivers a grave warning that the casual mockery and mimicry of political violence in America is chasing a generation from public service.

""The current climate of threats and attacks must stop,"" Pelosi writes.

""We cannot ask people to serve in public life if the cost is risking the safety of their families and those they love.""

Pelosi's book pages through familiar terrain for those who have followed the 84-year-old's career, rising from ""housewife to House member to House speaker."" The steely California Democrat, the speaker emerita, is no longer in leadership but running for reelection to the House this fall.

She twice won the speakers gavel, worked alongside seven presidents and, more recently, played a pivotal role in quietly convincing President Joe Biden to reassess his decision to remain in the 2024 presidential election rematch with Republican Donald Trump. Biden bowed out.

But it's the first and final chapters that bring a new element to the Pelosi era, detailing in personal and painstaking ways the toll that America's violent strain is taking on civic life and public service.

""I don't know that we will ever feel safe,"" she writes.

Written well before the July assassination attempt on Trump, Pelosi's assessment of the nation's dangerous discourse arrives after back-to-back congressional shootings of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise and earlier of Democratic former Rep. Gabby Giffords, and it serves as a walk-off warning in what could be among her final years in Congress.

Pelosi recounts her disbelief at being ""pulled off the Speaker's platform"" and out of the House chamber by security the afternoon of Jan. 6 as rioters sent by Trump stormed through the halls, some searching for her.

""I can handle it,"" she protested, telling U.S. Capitol Police she wanted to stay and finish the work as Congress was certifying the 2020 election.

""Their response was curt,"" she writes. ""'No, you can't.'""

After being whisked away to safety at Fort McNair, she writes about huddling with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the three of them desperately calling the Pentagon to send National Guard troops to restore order at the Capitol. She describes House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump loyalist, as almost entirely unseen.

So worried about the rioters' threats against Vice President Mike Pence in hiding at the Capitol, she called and told him, ""Don't let anybody know where you are.""

""It still took three hours from the time I was dragged out of the House chamber for the Guard to arrive at the Capitol complex,"" she writes. ""It took about three and a half hours to clear the rioters from the building.""

Later, surveying the wreckage of broken glass and splintered wood, she was told of blood outside the Speaker's Lobby. In some places, including her office, the mob had ""literally defecated on the floors and rugs,"" she wrote. ""What was left behind was pure destruction.""

She recalled being in war zones, and in Kyiv at the start of the Russian invasion thinking she may well die in Ukraine. ""I briefly thought the same on January 6,"" she wrote.

""When I became Speaker, I knew that I was making myself into a target,"" she writes. ""However, our accepting the risk is something that is fundamentally different for our families.""

Not quite two years later, she was awakened in the middle of the night by the ""Knock. Knock. Knock. Pound, Pound. Pound,"" of the Capitol Police security detail at her door in Washington.

Pelosi recounts the dizzying hours, frantic family phone calls and flight back to San Francisco, the hospital, the surgeries and the long recovery for her husband. Their youngest daughter said he looked like a bandaged-up Frankenstein.

Her son, Paul Jr., went to the family's home to vacuum up the broken glass and clean up the blood. Her daughter Alexandra, who had been a high schooler when Pelosi first ran for Congress, told her, had she known what they were signing up for she would ""never have given you my blessing.""

The attacker was tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. But Pelosi writes, the story of Paul's attack would not go away.

""Our home remains a heartbreaking crime scene,"" she wrote.

Pelosi said her children told her that for a long time Paul would only sleep in the bedroom when she was there. He still suffers from headaches and dizzy spells, and she said she has seen him faint and fall twice from vertigo. As of February, she wrote, she was still changing bandages from surgery on his arm.

Not quite two years later, the threat of political violence would come for her husband at their home.

""Where's Nancy? Where's Nancy?""

That was the chilling question the intruder posed to Paul Pelosi before bludgeoning the then-82-year-old over the head with a hammer in their San Francisco house. It echoed the menacing jeers of the rioters roaming the halls of the Capitol calling out ""Nancy, Nancy"" on Jan. 6.

The through line of escalating political rhetoric and violence in American public life serves as the opening and closing message of Pelosi's new book, ""The Art of Power, My Story as America's First Woman Speaker of the House.""

Pelosi recounts her nearly four-decade legislative record in Congress but also allows a rare public glimpse into the private devastation around the assault on her husband. With it, she delivers a grave warning that the casual mockery and mimicry of political violence in America is chasing a generation from public service.

""The current climate of threats and attacks must stop,"" Pelosi writes.

""We cannot ask people to serve in public life if the cost is risking the safety of their families and those they love.""

Pelosi's book pages through familiar terrain for those who have followed the 84-year-old's career, rising from ""housewife to House member to House speaker."" The steely California Democrat, the speaker emerita, is no longer in leadership but running for reelection to the House this fall.

She twice won the speakers gavel, worked alongside seven presidents and, more recently, played a pivotal role in quietly convincing President Joe Biden to reassess his decision to remain in the 2024 presidential election rematch with Republican Donald Trump. Biden bowed out.

But it's the first and final chapters that bring a new element to the Pelosi era, detailing in personal and painstaking ways the toll that America's violent strain is taking on civic life and public service.

""I don't know that we will ever feel safe,"" she writes.

Written well before the July assassination attempt on Trump, Pelosi's assessment of the nation's dangerous discourse arrives after back-to-back congressional shootings of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise and earlier of Democratic former Rep. Gabby Giffords, and it serves as a walk-off warning in what could be among her final years in Congress.

Pelosi recounts her disbelief at being ""pulled off the Speaker's platform"" and out of the House chamber by security the afternoon of Jan. 6 as rioters sent by Trump stormed through the halls, some searching for her.

""I can handle it,"" she protested, telling U.S. Capitol Police she wanted to stay and finish the work as Congress was certifying the 2020 election.

""Their response was curt,"" she writes. ""'No, you can't.'""

After being whisked away to safety at Fort McNair, she writes about huddling with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the three of them desperately calling the Pentagon to send National Guard troops to restore order at the Capitol. She describes House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump loyalist, as almost entirely unseen.

So worried about the rioters' threats against Vice President Mike Pence in hiding at the Capitol, she called and told him, ""Don't let anybody know where you are.""

""It still took three hours from the time I was dragged out of the House chamber for the Guard to arrive at the Capitol complex,"" she writes. ""It took about three and a half hours to clear the rioters from the building.""

Later, surveying the wreckage of broken glass and splintered wood, she was told of blood outside the Speaker's Lobby. In some places, including her office, the mob had ""literally defecated on the floors and rugs,"" she wrote. ""What was left behind was pure destruction.""

She recalled being in war zones, and in Kyiv at the start of the Russian invasion thinking she may well die in Ukraine. ""I briefly thought the same on January 6,"" she wrote.

""When I became Speaker, I knew that I was making myself into a target,"" she writes. ""However, our accepting the risk is something that is fundamentally different for our families.""

Not quite two years later, she was awakened in the middle of the night by the ""Knock. Knock. Knock. Pound, Pound. Pound,"" of the Capitol Police security detail at her door in Washington.

Pelosi recounts the dizzying hours, frantic family phone calls and flight back to San Francisco, the hospital, the surgeries and the long recovery for her husband. Their youngest daughter said he looked like a bandaged-up Frankenstein.

Her son, Paul Jr., went to the family's home to vacuum up the broken glass and clean up the blood. Her daughter Alexandra, who had been a high schooler when Pelosi first ran for Congress, told her, had she known what they were signing up for she would ""never have given you my blessing.""

The attacker was tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. But Pelosi writes, the story of Paul's attack would not go away.

""Our home remains a heartbreaking crime scene,"" she wrote.

Pelosi said her children told her that for a long time Paul would only sleep in the bedroom when she was there. He still suffers from headaches and dizzy spells, and she said she has seen him faint and fall twice from vertigo. As of February, she wrote, she was still changing bandages from surgery on his arm.

But the ""true horror"" she writes was the dehumanizing jokes by Republicans from Trump on down, including the former president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who posted a Paul Pelosi Halloween costume to social media, and the way the crowds would ""laugh, cheer, and applaud"" their cruel remarks.

Slow-moving Tropical Storm Debby bringing torrential rains, major flood threat to southeastern US

HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby has moved menacingly into some of America's most historic Southern cities in what is expected to be a prolonged event of torrential downpours and flooding after slamming into Florida with heavy rain and high winds. Record-setting rain from the storm that killed at least five people on Monday was causing flash flooding in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Savannah Mayor Van Johnson told residents Monday night to hunker down and expect a rough day on Tuesday. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida Monday as a Category 1 hurricane.

Bangladesh protesters want Nobel Peace Prize laureate Yunus to lead country after Hasina's departure

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- A key organizer of Bangladesh's student protests says Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is their choice as head of an interim government a day after the longtime Prime Minister Sheik Hasina resigned. The country's figurehead president and the military chief said Monday that an interim government would be formed soon. Nahid Islam, the organizer, in a video post in social media said Tuesday the student protest leaders have already talked with Yunus, who consented to take over. Islam said the student protesters would announce more names for the government, and it would be a difficult challenge for the current leadership to ignore their choices.

Japan's share benchmark soars nearly 11% a day after massive sell-offs that shook Wall Street

NEW YORK (AP) -- Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index has soared more than 10% a day after it set markets tumbling in Europe and on Wall Street, while other world markets appeared to have settled after the rollercoaster ride that started the week. The Japanese index fell back after its biggest early advance, gaining 8.7% by midmorning on Tuesday. On Monday, nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as world markets quaked under fears the U.S. economy is slowing too much. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed the Nikkei's 12.4% plunge, its worst since 1987.

Proxy forces armed by Iran could take part in retaliation against Israel over Hamas leader's killing

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- As Iran threatens to respond to the suspected Israeli assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, the regional militias that the Islamic Republic has armed for decades could play a role in any attack. They include Lebanon's Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels of Yemen, Shiite militias in Iraq and others. Those relationships are managed by Iran's powerful paramilitary organization, the Revolutionary Guard. Iran relies on those proxy forces as international sanctions on Tehran, including over its nuclear program, have kept it from receiving advanced weaponry. While developing its own missile program, Iran also relies on militias as an asymmetric threat to squeeze Israel and the United States.

Venezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo ""falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council"" and they openly incited ""police and military officials to disobey the laws.""

Google illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge has ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Witnesses will tell a federal safety board about the blowout on a Boeing 737 Max earlier this year

The National Transportation Safety Board is about to hold a two-day hearing into the blowout of a panel from the side of a Boeing 737 Max airliner. The safety board's hearing starts Tuesday in Washington, D.C. It will hear from witnesses including its own investigators who have been looking into the Jan. 5 accident that occurred during an Alaska Airlines flight. The board is calling it a fact-finding hearing. The NTSB will not vote on a probable cause for the accident. That step probably won't happen for another year or longer after more investigation.

Hiroshima governor says nuclear disarmament must be tackled as a pressing issue, not an ideal

TOKYO (AP) -- Hiroshima officials are urging world leaders to stop relying on nuclear weapons as deterrence and take immediate action toward abolishment -- not as an ideal, but to remove the risk of atomic war amid the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. They commented Tuesday as the city remembered its atomic bombing 79 years ago at the end of World War II. The memorial comes days after Japan and the U.S. reaffirmed Washington's commitment to ""extended deterrence,"" including atomic weapons, to protect its Asian ally. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has vowed to do his utmost to pursue ""realistic and practical measures"" to build global momentum for nuclear disarmament. Critics say it is a hollow promise.

Not quite two years later, the threat of political violence would come for her husband at their home.

""Where's Nancy? Where's Nancy?""

That was the chilling question the intruder posed to Paul Pelosi before bludgeoning the then-82-year-old over the head with a hammer in their San Francisco house. It echoed the menacing jeers of the rioters roaming the halls of the Capitol calling out ""Nancy, Nancy"" on Jan. 6.

The through line of escalating political rhetoric and violence in American public life serves as the opening and closing message of Pelosi's new book, ""The Art of Power, My Story as America's First Woman Speaker of the House.""

Pelosi recounts her nearly four-decade legislative record in Congress but also allows a rare public glimpse into the private devastation around the assault on her husband. With it, she delivers a grave warning that the casual mockery and mimicry of political violence in America is chasing a generation from public service.

""The current climate of threats and attacks must stop,"" Pelosi writes.

""We cannot ask people to serve in public life if the cost is risking the safety of their families and those they love.""

Pelosi's book pages through familiar terrain for those who have followed the 84-year-old's career, rising from ""housewife to House member to House speaker."" The steely California Democrat, the speaker emerita, is no longer in leadership but running for reelection to the House this fall.

She twice won the speakers gavel, worked alongside seven presidents and, more recently, played a pivotal role in quietly convincing President Joe Biden to reassess his decision to remain in the 2024 presidential election rematch with Republican Donald Trump. Biden bowed out.

But it's the first and final chapters that bring a new element to the Pelosi era, detailing in personal and painstaking ways the toll that America's violent strain is taking on civic life and public service.

""I don't know that we will ever feel safe,"" she writes.

Written well before the July assassination attempt on Trump, Pelosi's assessment of the nation's dangerous discourse arrives after back-to-back congressional shootings of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise and earlier of Democratic former Rep. Gabby Giffords, and it serves as a walk-off warning in what could be among her final years in Congress.

Pelosi recounts her disbelief at being ""pulled off the Speaker's platform"" and out of the House chamber by security the afternoon of Jan. 6 as rioters sent by Trump stormed through the halls, some searching for her.

""I can handle it,"" she protested, telling U.S. Capitol Police she wanted to stay and finish the work as Congress was certifying the 2020 election.

""Their response was curt,"" she writes. ""'No, you can't.'""

After being whisked away to safety at Fort McNair, she writes about huddling with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the three of them desperately calling the Pentagon to send National Guard troops to restore order at the Capitol. She describes House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump loyalist, as almost entirely unseen.

So worried about the rioters' threats against Vice President Mike Pence in hiding at the Capitol, she called and told him, ""Don't let anybody know where you are.""

""It still took three hours from the time I was dragged out of the House chamber for the Guard to arrive at the Capitol complex,"" she writes. ""It took about three and a half hours to clear the rioters from the building.""

Later, surveying the wreckage of broken glass and splintered wood, she was told of blood outside the Speaker's Lobby. In some places, including her office, the mob had ""literally defecated on the floors and rugs,"" she wrote. ""What was left behind was pure destruction.""

She recalled being in war zones, and in Kyiv at the start of the Russian invasion thinking she may well die in Ukraine. ""I briefly thought the same on January 6,"" she wrote.

""When I became Speaker, I knew that I was making myself into a target,"" she writes. ""However, our accepting the risk is something that is fundamentally different for our families.""

Not quite two years later, she was awakened in the middle of the night by the ""Knock. Knock. Knock. Pound, Pound. Pound,"" of the Capitol Police security detail at her door in Washington.

Pelosi recounts the dizzying hours, frantic family phone calls and flight back to San Francisco, the hospital, the surgeries and the long recovery for her husband. Their youngest daughter said he looked like a bandaged-up Frankenstein.

Her son, Paul Jr., went to the family's home to vacuum up the broken glass and clean up the blood. Her daughter Alexandra, who had been a high schooler when Pelosi first ran for Congress, told her, had she known what they were signing up for she would ""never have given you my blessing.""

The attacker was tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. But Pelosi writes, the story of Paul's attack would not go away.

""Our home remains a heartbreaking crime scene,"" she wrote.

Pelosi said her children told her that for a long time Paul would only sleep in the bedroom when she was there. He still suffers from headaches and dizzy spells, and she said she has seen him faint and fall twice from vertigo. As of February, she wrote, she was still changing bandages from surgery on his arm.

But the ""true horror"" she writes was the dehumanizing jokes by Republicans from Trump on down, including the former president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who posted a Paul Pelosi Halloween costume to social media, and the way the crowds would ""laugh, cheer, and applaud"" their cruel remarks.

""It made me profoundly sad for our country,"" she writes.

Pelosi situates the two bloody episodes in the arc of her career, from the way Republicans vilified her in countless campaign ads from the time she first rose as Democratic leader to the way protesters spit on Democrats, including civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, the day the House voted for the Affordable Care Act, to the severed pig's head left outside her family's home in the days before Jan. 6.

Pelosi writes that when she speaks to young people about running for office, ""especially young women, too often I hear their reluctance to put their families in harm's way.""

""This is not the way our country should be -- if you engage in public service, you should not be a target, and your family should not be a target.""","{'uri': ['associated_press@greenfieldreporter.com'], 'name': ['Associated Press'], 'type': ['author'], 'isAgency': [False]}",https://www.greenfieldreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/preview-374.jpg,-0.4431,460616107,1,greenfieldreporter.com,news,Greenfield Daily Reporter,,2024-08-06

Slow-moving Tropical Storm Debby bringing torrential rains, major flood threat to southeastern US

HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby has moved menacingly into some of America's most historic Southern cities in what is expected to be a prolonged event of torrential downpours and flooding after slamming into Florida with heavy rain and high winds. Record-setting rain from the storm that killed at least five people on Monday was causing flash flooding in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Savannah Mayor Van Johnson told residents Monday night to hunker down and expect a rough day on Tuesday. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida Monday as a Category 1 hurricane.

Bangladesh protesters want Nobel Peace Prize laureate Yunus to lead country after Hasina's departure

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- A key organizer of Bangladesh's student protests says Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is their choice as head of an interim government a day after the longtime Prime Minister Sheik Hasina resigned. The country's figurehead president and the military chief said Monday that an interim government would be formed soon. Nahid Islam, the organizer, in a video post in social media said Tuesday the student protest leaders have already talked with Yunus, who consented to take over. Islam said the student protesters would announce more names for the government, and it would be a difficult challenge for the current leadership to ignore their choices.

Japan's share benchmark soars nearly 11% a day after massive sell-offs that shook Wall Street

NEW YORK (AP) -- Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index has soared more than 10% a day after it set markets tumbling in Europe and on Wall Street, while other world markets appeared to have settled after the rollercoaster ride that started the week. The Japanese index fell back after its biggest early advance, gaining 8.7% by midmorning on Tuesday. On Monday, nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as world markets quaked under fears the U.S. economy is slowing too much. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed the Nikkei's 12.4% plunge, its worst since 1987.

Proxy forces armed by Iran could take part in retaliation against Israel over Hamas leader's killing

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- As Iran threatens to respond to the suspected Israeli assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, the regional militias that the Islamic Republic has armed for decades could play a role in any attack. They include Lebanon's Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels of Yemen, Shiite militias in Iraq and others. Those relationships are managed by Iran's powerful paramilitary organization, the Revolutionary Guard. Iran relies on those proxy forces as international sanctions on Tehran, including over its nuclear program, have kept it from receiving advanced weaponry. While developing its own missile program, Iran also relies on militias as an asymmetric threat to squeeze Israel and the United States.

Venezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo ""falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council"" and they openly incited ""police and military officials to disobey the laws.""

Google illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge has ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Witnesses will tell a federal safety board about the blowout on a Boeing 737 Max earlier this year

The National Transportation Safety Board is about to hold a two-day hearing into the blowout of a panel from the side of a Boeing 737 Max airliner. The safety board's hearing starts Tuesday in Washington, D.C. It will hear from witnesses including its own investigators who have been looking into the Jan. 5 accident that occurred during an Alaska Airlines flight. The board is calling it a fact-finding hearing. The NTSB will not vote on a probable cause for the accident. That step probably won't happen for another year or longer after more investigation.

Hiroshima governor says nuclear disarmament must be tackled as a pressing issue, not an ideal

TOKYO (AP) -- Hiroshima officials are urging world leaders to stop relying on nuclear weapons as deterrence and take immediate action toward abolishment -- not as an ideal, but to remove the risk of atomic war amid the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. They commented Tuesday as the city remembered its atomic bombing 79 years ago at the end of World War II. The memorial comes days after Japan and the U.S. reaffirmed Washington's commitment to ""extended deterrence,"" including atomic weapons, to protect its Asian ally. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has vowed to do his utmost to pursue ""realistic and practical measures"" to build global momentum for nuclear disarmament. Critics say it is a hollow promise.

The Latest: Debby blamed for multiple deaths in Florida, Georgia, leaves thousands without power

Tropical storm Debby made landfall as a hurricane in one of the least populated areas of Florida, but it's been blamed for at least four deaths in that state. Another death was reported in Georgia as the storm began lashing that state with potentially devastating rains. Officials say hundreds of people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, and neighboring Manatee County. Debby was expected to slow to a crawl as it turns to the east, and forecasters warn that heavy rain could spawn more flooding in Florida and especially coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Substantial flooding is possible in parts of North Carolina as well.

Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris, a daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history, formally secured the Democratic presidential nomination on Monday -- becoming the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket.

More than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed, Harris' coronation as her party's standard-bearer caps a tumultuous and frenetic period for Democrats prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous June debate performance that shattered his own supporters' confidence in his reelection prospects and spurred extraordinary intraparty warfare about whether he should stay in the race.

Just as soon as Biden abruptly ended his candidacy, Harris and her team worked rapidly to secure backing from the 1,976 party delegates needed to clinch the nomination in a formal roll call vote. She reached that marker at warp speed, with an Associated Press survey of delegates nationwide showing she locked down the necessary commitments a mere 32 hours after Biden's announcement.

Harris' nomination became official after a five-day round of online balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates ended Monday night, with the party saying in a statement released just before midnight that 99% of delegates casting ballots had done so for Harris. The party had long contemplated the early virtual roll call to ensure Biden would appear on the ballot in every state. It said it would next formally certify the vote before holding a celebratory roll call at the party's convention later this month in Chicago.

An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted after Biden withdrew found 46% of Americans have a favorable view of Harris, while a nearly identical share has an unfavorable view of her. But more Democrats say they are satisfied with her candidacy compared with that of Biden, energizing a party that had long been resigned to the 81-year-old Biden being its nominee against former President Donald Trump, a Republican they view as an existential threat.

Already Harris has telegraphed that she doesn't plan to veer much from the themes and policies that framed Biden's candidacy, such as democracy, gun violence prevention and abortion rights. But her delivery can be far fierier, particularly when she invokes her prosecutorial background to lambast Trump and his 34 felony convictions for falsifying business records in connection with a hush money scheme.

""Given that unique voice of a new generation, of a prosecutor and a woman when fundamental rights, especially reproductive rights, are on the line, it's almost as if the stars have aligned for her at this moment in history,"" said Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California, who was tapped to succeed Harris in the Senate when she became vice president.

A splash in Washington before a collapse in the 2020 primaries

Kamala Devi Harris was born Oct. 20, 1964, in Oakland, California, to Shyamala Gopalan, a breast cancer scientist who emigrated to the United States from India when she was 19 years old, and Stanford University emeritus professor Donald Harris, a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Jamaica. Her parents' advocacy for civil rights gave her what she described as a ""stroller's-eye view"" of the movement.

She spent years as a prosecutor in the Bay Area before her elevation as the state's attorney general in 2010 and then election as U.S. senator in 2016.

Harris arrived in Washington as a senator at the dawn of the volatile Trump era, quickly establishing herself as a reliable liberal opponent of the new president's personnel and policies and fanning speculation about a presidential bid of her own. Securing a spot on the coveted Judiciary Committee gave her a national spotlight to interrogate prominent Trump nominees, such as now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

""I'm not able to be rushed this fast,"" then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions said during a 2017 hearing as Harris repeatedly pressed him on potential conversations with Russian nationals. ""It makes me nervous.""

Harris launched her 2020 presidential campaign with much promise, drawing parallels to former President Barack Obama and attracting more than 20,000 people to a kickoff rally in her hometown. But Harris withdrew from the primary race before the first nominating contest in Iowa, plagued by staff dissent that spilled out into the open and an inability to attract enough campaign cash.

Harris struggled to deliver a consistent pitch to Democratic voters and wobbled on key issues such as health care. She suggested she backed eliminating private insurance for a full government-run system -- ""Medicare for All"" coverage -- before releasing her own health care plan that preserved private insurance. Now, during her nascent general election campaign, Harris has already reversed some of her earlier, more liberal positions, such as a ban on fracking that she endorsed in 2019.

And while Harris tried to deploy her law enforcement background as an asset in her 2020 presidential campaign, it never attracted enough support in a party that couldn't reconcile some of her past tough-on-crime positions at a time of heightened focus on police brutality.

Joining Biden's team -- and an evolution as vice president

Still, Harris was at the top of the vice presidential shortlist when Biden was pondering his running mate, after his pledge in early 2020 that he would choose a Black woman as his No. 2. He was fond of Harris, who had forged a close friendship with his now-deceased son Beau, who had been Delaware's attorney general when she was in that job for California.

Her first months as vice president were far from smooth. Biden asked her to lead the administration's diplomatic efforts with Central America on the root causes of migration to the United States, which triggered attacks from Republicans on border security and remains a political vulnerability. It didn't help matters that Harris stumbled in big interviews, such as in a 2021 sit-down with NBC News' Lester Holt when she responded dismissively that ""I haven't been to Europe"" when the anchor noted that she hadn't visited the U.S.-Mexico border.

For her first two years, Harris also was often tethered to Washington so she could break tie votes in the evenly divided Senate, which gave Democrats landmark wins on the climate and health care but also constrained opportunities for her to travel around the country and meet voters.

Her visibility became far more prominent after the 2022 Supreme Court ruling that dismantled Roe v. Wade, as she became the chief spokesperson for the administration on abortion rights and was a more natural messenger than Biden, a lifelong Catholic who had in the past favored restrictions on the procedure. She is the first vice president to tour an abortion clinic and speaks about reproductive rights in the broader context of maternal health, especially for Black women.

Throughout her vice presidency, Harris has been careful to remain loyal to Biden while emphasizing that she would be ready to step in if needed. That dramatic transition began in late June after the first debate between Biden and Trump, where the president's stumbles were so cataclysmic that he could never reverse the loss of confidence from other Democrats.

Headed to the top of the ticket

After Biden ended his candidacy July 21, he quickly endorsed Harris. And during the first two weeks of her 2024 presidential bid, enthusiasm among the Democratic base surged, with donations pouring in, scores of volunteers showing up at field offices and supporters swelling so much in numbers that event organizers have had to swap venues.

The Harris campaign now believes it has a renewed opportunity to compete in Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia -- states that Biden had started to abandon in favor of shoring up the so-called ""blue wall"" states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

""The country is able to see the Kamala Harris that we all know,"" said Bakari Sellers, who was a national co-chair of her 2020 campaign. ""We really didn't allow the country to see her"" four years ago. Sellers said: ""We had her in bubble wrap. What people are seeing now is that she's real, she's talented.""

Yet Democrats are anticipating that Harris' political honeymoon will wear off, and she is inevitably going to come under tougher scrutiny for Biden administration positions, the state of the economy and volatile situations abroad, particularly in the Middle East. Harris has also yet to answer extended questions from journalists nor sit down for a formal interview since she began her run.

The Trump campaign has been eager to define Harris as she continues to introduce herself to voters nationwide, releasing an ad blaming her for the high number of illegal crossings at the southern border during the Biden administration and dubbing her ""Failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal.""

The Republican nominee's supporters have also derisively branded Harris as a diversity hire, while Trump himself has engaged in ugly racial attacks of his own, wrongly asserting that Harris had in the past only promoted her Indian heritage and only recently played up her Black identity.

His remarks are previewing a season of racist and sexist claims against the person who would be the first woman and the first person of South Asian heritage in the presidency.

""I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black,"" Trump said while addressing the annual convention of the National Association of Black Journalists. ""So, I don't know, is she Indian or is she Black?""

In her response, Harris called it ""the same old show -- the divisiveness and the disrespect"" and said voters ""deserve better.""

""The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth, a leader who does not respond with hostility and anger when confronted with the facts,"" Harris said at a Sigma Gamma Rho sorority gathering in Houston. ""We deserve a leader who understands that our differences do not divide us.""

Not quite two years later, the threat of political violence would come for her husband at their home .

""Where's Nancy? Where's Nancy?""

That was the chilling question the intruder posed to Paul Pelosi before bludgeoning the then-82-year-old over the head with a hammer in their San Francisco house. It echoed the menacing jeers of the rioters roaming the halls of the Capitol calling out ""Nancy, Nancy"" on Jan. 6.

The through line of escalating political rhetoric and violence in American public life serves as the opening and closing message of Pelosi's new book, ""The Art of Power, My Story as America's First Woman Speaker of the House.""

Pelosi recounts her nearly four-decade legislative record in Congress but also allows a rare public glimpse into the private devastation around the assault on her husband. With it, she delivers a grave warning that the casual mockery and mimicry of political violence in America is chasing a generation from public service.

""The current climate of threats and attacks must stop,"" Pelosi writes.

""We cannot ask people to serve in public life if the cost is risking the safety of their families and those they love.""

Pelosi's book pages through familiar terrain for those who have followed the 84-year-old's career, rising from ""housewife to House member to House speaker."" The steely California Democrat, the speaker emerita, is no longer in leadership but running for reelection to the House this fall.

She twice won the speakers gavel, worked alongside seven presidents and, more recently, played a pivotal role in quietly convincing President Joe Biden to reassess his decision to remain in the 2024 presidential election rematch with Republican Donald Trump . Biden bowed out .

But it's the first and final chapters that bring a new element to the Pelosi era, detailing in personal and painstaking ways the toll that America's violent strain is taking on civic life and public service.

""I don't know that we will ever feel safe,"" she writes.

Written well before the July assassination attempt on Trump, Pelosi's assessment of the nation's dangerous discourse arrives after back-to-back congressional shootings of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise and earlier of Democratic former Rep. Gabby Giffords, and it serves as a walk-off warning in what could be among her final years in Congress.

Pelosi recounts her disbelief at being ""pulled off the Speaker's platform"" and out of the House chamber by security the afternoon of Jan. 6 as rioters sent by Trump stormed through the halls, some searching for her.

""I can handle it,"" she protested, telling U.S. Capitol Police she wanted to stay and finish the work as Congress was certifying the 2020 election.

""Their response was curt,"" she writes. ""'No, you can't.'""

After being whisked away to safety at Fort McNair, she writes about huddling with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the three of them desperately calling the Pentagon to send National Guard troops to restore order at the Capitol. She describes House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump loyalist, as almost entirely unseen.

So worried about the rioters' threats against Vice President Mike Pence in hiding at the Capitol, she called and told him, ""Don't let anybody know where you are.""

""It still took three hours from the time I was dragged out of the House chamber for the Guard to arrive at the Capitol complex,"" she writes. ""It took about three and a half hours to clear the rioters from the building.""

Later, surveying the wreckage of broken glass and splintered wood, she was told of blood outside the Speaker's Lobby. In some places, including her office, the mob had ""literally defecated on the floors and rugs,"" she wrote. ""What was left behind was pure destruction.""

She recalled being in war zones, and in Kyiv at the start of the Russian invasion thinking she may well die in Ukraine. ""I briefly thought the same on January 6,"" she wrote.

""When I became Speaker, I knew that I was making myself into a target,"" she writes. ""However, our accepting the risk is something that is fundamentally different for our families.""

Not quite two years later, she was awakened in the middle of the night by the ""Knock. Knock. Knock. Pound, Pound. Pound,"" of the Capitol Police security detail at her door in Washington.

Pelosi recounts the dizzying hours, frantic family phone calls and flight back to San Francisco, the hospital, the surgeries and the long recovery for her husband. Their youngest daughter said he looked like a bandaged-up Frankenstein.

Her son, Paul Jr., went to the family's home to vacuum up the broken glass and clean up the blood. Her daughter Alexandra, who had been a high schooler when Pelosi first ran for Congress, told her, had she known what they were signing up for she would ""never have given you my blessing.""

The attacker was tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. But Pelosi writes, the story of Paul's attack would not go away.

""Our home remains a heartbreaking crime scene,"" she wrote.

Pelosi said her children told her that for a long time Paul would only sleep in the bedroom when she was there. He still suffers from headaches and dizzy spells, and she said she has seen him faint and fall twice from vertigo. As of February, she wrote, she was still changing bandages from surgery on his arm.

But the ""true horror"" she writes was the dehumanizing jokes by Republicans from Trump on down, including the former president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who posted a Paul Pelosi Halloween costume to social media, and the way the crowds would ""laugh, cheer, and applaud"" their cruel remarks.

""It made me profoundly sad for our country,"" she writes.

Pelosi situates the two bloody episodes in the arc of her career, from the way Republicans vilified her in countless campaign ads from the time she first rose as Democratic leader to the way protesters spit on Democrats, including civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, the day the House voted for the Affordable Care Act, to the severed pig's head left outside her family's home in the days before Jan. 6.

Pelosi writes that when she speaks to young people about running for office, ""especially young women, too often I hear their reluctance to put their families in harm's way.""

""This is not the way our country should be -- if you engage in public service, you should not be a target, and your family should not be a target.""",[],https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2100/2023/06/06143349/wbal-logo.png,-0.4431,460615952,1,wbal.com,news,WBAL,,2024-08-06

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris, a daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history, formally secured the Democratic presidential nomination on Monday -- becoming the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket.

More than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed, Harris' coronation as her party's standard-bearer caps a tumultuous and frenetic period for Democrats prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous June debate performance that shattered his own supporters' confidence in his reelection prospects and spurred extraordinary intraparty warfare about whether he should stay in the race.

Just as soon as Biden abruptly ended his candidacy, Harris and her team worked rapidly to secure backing from the 1,976 party delegates needed to clinch the nomination in a formal roll call vote. She reached that marker at warp speed, with an Associated Press survey of delegates nationwide showing she locked down the necessary commitments a mere 32 hours after Biden's announcement.

Harris' nomination became official after a five-day round of online balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates ended Monday night, with the party saying in a statement released just before midnight that 99% of delegates casting ballots had done so for Harris. The party had long contemplated the early virtual roll call to ensure Biden would appear on the ballot in every state. It said it would next formally certify the vote before holding a celebratory roll call at the party's convention later this month in Chicago.

An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted after Biden withdrew found 46% of Americans have a favorable view of Harris, while a nearly identical share has an unfavorable view of her. But more Democrats say they are satisfied with her candidacy compared with that of Biden, energizing a party that had long been resigned to the 81-year-old Biden being its nominee against former President Donald Trump, a Republican they view as an existential threat.

Already Harris has telegraphed that she doesn't plan to veer much from the themes and policies that framed Biden's candidacy, such as democracy, gun violence prevention and abortion rights. But her delivery can be far fierier, particularly when she invokes her prosecutorial background to lambast Trump and his 34 felony convictions for falsifying business records in connection with a hush money scheme.

""Given that unique voice of a new generation, of a prosecutor and a woman when fundamental rights, especially reproductive rights, are on the line, it's almost as if the stars have aligned for her at this moment in history,"" said Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California, who was tapped to succeed Harris in the Senate when she became vice president.

A splash in Washington before a collapse in the 2020 primaries

Kamala Devi Harris was born Oct. 20, 1964, in Oakland, California, to Shyamala Gopalan, a breast cancer scientist who emigrated to the United States from India when she was 19 years old, and Stanford University emeritus professor Donald Harris, a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Jamaica. Her parents' advocacy for civil rights gave her what she described as a ""stroller's-eye view"" of the movement.

She spent years as a prosecutor in the Bay Area before her elevation as the state's attorney general in 2010 and then election as U.S. senator in 2016.

Harris arrived in Washington as a senator at the dawn of the volatile Trump era, quickly establishing herself as a reliable liberal opponent of the new president's personnel and policies and fanning speculation about a presidential bid of her own. Securing a spot on the coveted Judiciary Committee gave her a national spotlight to interrogate prominent Trump nominees, such as now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

""I'm not able to be rushed this fast,"" then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions said during a 2017 hearing as Harris repeatedly pressed him on potential conversations with Russian nationals. ""It makes me nervous.""

Harris launched her 2020 presidential campaign with much promise, drawing parallels to former President Barack Obama and attracting more than 20,000 people to a kickoff rally in her hometown. But Harris withdrew from the primary race before the first nominating contest in Iowa, plagued by staff dissent that spilled out into the open and an inability to attract enough campaign cash.

Harris struggled to deliver a consistent pitch to Democratic voters and wobbled on key issues such as health care. She suggested she backed eliminating private insurance for a full government-run system -- ""Medicare for All"" coverage -- before releasing her own health care plan that preserved private insurance. Now, during her nascent general election campaign, Harris has already reversed some of her earlier, more liberal positions, such as a ban on fracking that she endorsed in 2019.

And while Harris tried to deploy her law enforcement background as an asset in her 2020 presidential campaign, it never attracted enough support in a party that couldn't reconcile some of her past tough-on-crime positions at a time of heightened focus on police brutality.

Joining Biden's team -- and an evolution as vice president

Still, Harris was at the top of the vice presidential shortlist when Biden was pondering his running mate, after his pledge in early 2020 that he would choose a Black woman as his No. 2. He was fond of Harris, who had forged a close friendship with his now-deceased son Beau, who had been Delaware's attorney general when she was in that job for California.

Her first months as vice president were far from smooth. Biden asked her to lead the administration's diplomatic efforts with Central America on the root causes of migration to the United States, which triggered attacks from Republicans on border security and remains a political vulnerability. It didn't help matters that Harris stumbled in big interviews, such as in a 2021 sit-down with NBC News' Lester Holt when she responded dismissively that ""I haven't been to Europe"" when the anchor noted that she hadn't visited the U.S.-Mexico border.

For her first two years, Harris also was often tethered to Washington so she could break tie votes in the evenly divided Senate, which gave Democrats landmark wins on the climate and health care but also constrained opportunities for her to travel around the country and meet voters.

Her visibility became far more prominent after the 2022 Supreme Court ruling that dismantled Roe v. Wade, as she became the chief spokesperson for the administration on abortion rights and was a more natural messenger than Biden, a lifelong Catholic who had in the past favored restrictions on the procedure. She is the first vice president to tour an abortion clinic and speaks about reproductive rights in the broader context of maternal health, especially for Black women.

Throughout her vice presidency, Harris has been careful to remain loyal to Biden while emphasizing that she would be ready to step in if needed. That dramatic transition began in late June after the first debate between Biden and Trump, where the president's stumbles were so cataclysmic that he could never reverse the loss of confidence from other Democrats.

Headed to the top of the ticket

After Biden ended his candidacy July 21, he quickly endorsed Harris. And during the first two weeks of her 2024 presidential bid, enthusiasm among the Democratic base surged, with donations pouring in, scores of volunteers showing up at field offices and supporters swelling so much in numbers that event organizers have had to swap venues.

The Harris campaign now believes it has a renewed opportunity to compete in Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia -- states that Biden had started to abandon in favor of shoring up the so-called ""blue wall"" states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

""The country is able to see the Kamala Harris that we all know,"" said Bakari Sellers, who was a national co-chair of her 2020 campaign. ""We really didn't allow the country to see her"" four years ago. Sellers said: ""We had her in bubble wrap. What people are seeing now is that she's real, she's talented.""

Yet Democrats are anticipating that Harris' political honeymoon will wear off, and she is inevitably going to come under tougher scrutiny for Biden administration positions, the state of the economy and volatile situations abroad, particularly in the Middle East. Harris has also yet to answer extended questions from journalists nor sit down for a formal interview since she began her run.

The Trump campaign has been eager to define Harris as she continues to introduce herself to voters nationwide, releasing an ad blaming her for the high number of illegal crossings at the southern border during the Biden administration and dubbing her ""Failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal.""

Her son, Paul Jr., went to the family's home to vacuum up the broken glass and clean up the blood. Her daughter Alexandra, who had been a high schooler when Pelosi first ran for Congress, told her, had she known what they were signing up for she would ""never have given you my blessing.""

Pelosi said her children told her that for a long time Paul would only sleep in the bedroom when she was there. He still suffers from headaches and dizzy spells, and she said she has seen him faint and fall twice from vertigo. As of February, she wrote, she was still changing bandages from surgery on his arm.

But the ""true horror"" she writes was the dehumanizing jokes by Republicans from Trump on down, including the former president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who posted a Paul Pelosi Halloween costume to social media, and the way the crowds would ""laugh, cheer, and applaud"" their cruel remarks.

""It made me profoundly sad for our country,"" she writes.

Pelosi situates the two bloody episodes in the arc of her career, from the way Republicans vilified her in countless campaign ads from the time she first rose as Democratic leader to the way protesters spit on Democrats, including civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, the day the House voted for the Affordable Care Act, to the severed pig's head left outside her family's home in the days before Jan. 6.

Not quite two years later, the threat of political violence would come for her husband at their home.

""Where's Nancy? Where's Nancy?""

That was the chilling question the intruder posed to Paul Pelosi before bludgeoning the then-82-year-old over the head with a hammer in their San Francisco house. It echoed the menacing jeers of the rioters roaming the halls of the Capitol calling out ""Nancy, Nancy"" on Jan. 6.

Pelosi recounts her nearly four-decade legislative record in Congress but also allows a rare public glimpse into the private devastation around the assault on her husband. With it, she delivers a grave warning that the casual mockery and mimicry of political violence in America is chasing a generation from public service.

""I don't know that we will ever feel safe,"" she writes.

Written well before the July assassination attempt on Trump, Pelosi's assessment of the nation's dangerous discourse arrives after back-to-back congressional shootings of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise and earlier of Democratic former Rep. Gabby Giffords, and it serves as a walk-off warning in what could be among her final years in Congress.

Pelosi recounts her disbelief at being ""pulled off the Speaker's platform"" and out of the House chamber by security the afternoon of Jan. 6 as rioters sent by Trump stormed through the halls, some searching for her.

""I can handle it,"" she protested, telling U.S. Capitol Police she wanted to stay and finish the work as Congress was certifying the 2020 election.

""Their response was curt,"" she writes. ""'No, you can't.'""

After being whisked away to safety at Fort McNair, she writes about huddling with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the three of them desperately calling the Pentagon to send National Guard troops to restore order at the Capitol. She describes House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump loyalist, as almost entirely unseen.

So worried about the rioters' threats against Vice President Mike Pence in hiding at the Capitol, she called and told him, ""Don't let anybody know where you are.""

""It still took three hours from the time I was dragged out of the House chamber for the Guard to arrive at the Capitol complex,"" she writes. ""It took about three and a half hours to clear the rioters from the building.""

Later, surveying the wreckage of broken glass and splintered wood, she was told of blood outside the Speaker's Lobby. In some places, including her office, the mob had ""literally defecated on the floors and rugs,"" she wrote. ""What was left behind was pure destruction.""

She recalled being in war zones, and in Kyiv at the start of the Russian invasion thinking she may well die in Ukraine. ""I briefly thought the same on January 6,"" she wrote.

""When I became Speaker, I knew that I was making myself into a target,"" she writes. ""However, our accepting the risk is something that is fundamentally different for our families.""

Not quite two years later, she was awakened in the middle of the night by the ""Knock. Knock. Knock. Pound, Pound. Pound,"" of the Capitol Police security detail at her door in Washington.

She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.

The Latest: Debby blamed for multiple deaths in Florida, Georgia, leaves thousands without power

Tropical storm Debby made landfall as a hurricane in one of the least populated areas of Florida, but it's been blamed for at least four deaths in that state. Another death was reported in Georgia as the storm began lashing that state with potentially devastating rains. Officials say hundreds of people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, and neighboring Manatee County. Debby was expected to slow to a crawl as it turns to the east, and forecasters warn that heavy rain could spawn more flooding in Florida and especially coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Substantial flooding is possible in parts of North Carolina as well.

Japan's share benchmark soars nearly 11% a day after massive sell-offs that shook Wall Street

NEW YORK (AP) -- Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index has soared more than 10% a day after it set markets tumbling in Europe and on Wall Street, while other world markets appeared to have settled after the rollercoaster ride that started the week. The Japanese index fell back after its biggest early advance, gaining 8.7% by midmorning. On Monday, nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as world markets quaked under fears the U.S. economy is slowing too much. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed the Nikkei's 12.4% plunge, its worst since 1987.

Google illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge has ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Proxy forces armed by Iran could take part in retaliation against Israel over Hamas leader's killing

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- As Iran threatens to respond to the suspected Israeli assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, the regional militias that the Islamic Republic has armed for decades could play a role in any attack. They include Lebanon's Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels of Yemen, Shiite militias in Iraq and others. Those relationships are managed by Iran's powerful paramilitary organization, the Revolutionary Guard. Iran relies on those proxy forces as international sanctions on Tehran, including over its nuclear program, have kept it from receiving advanced weaponry. While developing its own missile program, Iran also relies on militias as an asymmetric threat to squeeze Israel and the United States.

Venezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo ""falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council"" and they openly incited ""police and military officials to disobey the laws.""

Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.

Hiroshima governor says nuclear disarmament must be tackled as a pressing issue, not an ideal

TOKYO (AP) -- Hiroshima officials are urging world leaders to stop relying on nuclear weapons as deterrence and take immediate action toward abolishment -- not as an ideal, but to remove the risk of atomic war amid the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. They commented Tuesday as the city remembered its atomic bombing 79 years ago at the end of World War II. The memorial comes days after Japan and the U.S. reaffirmed Washington's commitment to ""extended deterrence,"" including atomic weapons, to protect its Asian ally. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has vowed to do his utmost to pursue ""realistic and practical measures"" to build global momentum for nuclear disarmament. Critics say it is a hollow promise.

LYON, France (AP) -- Jean-Philippe Mateta scored twice as France advanced to the final of the men's soccer tournament at the Paris Olympics with a 3-1 win over Egypt after extra time. France will play Spain in Friday's final at Parc des Princes in a match that will ensure a first European gold medalist for 32 years.

Slow-moving Tropical Storm Debby bringing torrential rains, major flood threat to southeastern US

HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby has moved menacingly into some of America's most historic Southern cities in what is expected to be a prolonged event of torrential downpours and flooding after slamming into Florida with heavy rain and high winds. Record-setting rain from the storm that killed at least five people on Monday was causing flash flooding in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Savannah Mayor Van Johnson told residents Monday night to hunker down and expect a rough day on Tuesday. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida Monday as a Category 1 hurricane.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is now official after the Democratic National Committee announced the formal results of the online voting by delegates on Monday night. It caps a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is a daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.

The Latest: Debby blamed for multiple deaths in Florida, Georgia, leaves thousands without power

Tropical storm Debby made landfall as a hurricane in one of the least populated areas of Florida, but it's been blamed for at least four deaths in that state. Another death was reported in Georgia as the storm began lashing that state with potentially devastating rains. Officials say hundreds of people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, and neighboring Manatee County. Debby was expected to slow to a crawl as it turns to the east, and forecasters warn that heavy rain could spawn more flooding in Florida and especially coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Substantial flooding is possible in parts of North Carolina as well.

Japan's share benchmark soars nearly 11% a day after massive sell-offs that shook Wall Street

NEW YORK (AP) -- Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index has soared more than 10% a day after it set markets tumbling in Europe and on Wall Street, while other world markets appeared to have settled after the rollercoaster ride that started the week. The Japanese index fell back after its biggest early advance, gaining 8.7% by midmorning. On Monday, nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as world markets quaked under fears the U.S. economy is slowing too much. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed the Nikkei's 12.4% plunge, its worst since 1987.

Google illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge has ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Proxy forces armed by Iran could take part in retaliation against Israel over Hamas leader's killing

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- As Iran threatens to respond to the suspected Israeli assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, the regional militias that the Islamic Republic has armed for decades could play a role in any attack. They include Lebanon's Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels of Yemen, Shiite militias in Iraq and others. Those relationships are managed by Iran's powerful paramilitary organization, the Revolutionary Guard. Iran relies on those proxy forces as international sanctions on Tehran, including over its nuclear program, have kept it from receiving advanced weaponry. While developing its own missile program, Iran also relies on militias as an asymmetric threat to squeeze Israel and the United States.

Venezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo ""falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council"" and they openly incited ""police and military officials to disobey the laws.""

Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.

Hiroshima governor says nuclear disarmament must be tackled as a pressing issue, not an ideal

TOKYO (AP) -- Hiroshima officials are urging world leaders to stop relying on nuclear weapons as deterrence and take immediate action toward abolishment -- not as an ideal, but to remove the risk of atomic war amid the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. They commented Tuesday as the city remembered its atomic bombing 79 years ago at the end of World War II. The memorial comes days after Japan and the U.S. reaffirmed Washington's commitment to ""extended deterrence,"" including atomic weapons, to protect its Asian ally. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has vowed to do his utmost to pursue ""realistic and practical measures"" to build global momentum for nuclear disarmament. Critics say it is a hollow promise.

Not quite two years later, the threat of political violence would come for her husband at their home.

""Where's Nancy? Where's Nancy?""

That was the chilling question the intruder posed to Paul Pelosi before bludgeoning the then-82-year-old over the head with a hammer in their San Francisco house. It echoed the menacing jeers of the rioters roaming the halls of the Capitol calling out ""Nancy, Nancy"" on Jan. 6.

The through line of escalating political rhetoric and violence in American public life serves as the opening and closing message of Pelosi's new book, ""The Art of Power, My Story as America's First Woman Speaker of the House.""

Pelosi recounts her nearly four-decade legislative record in Congress but also allows a rare public glimpse into the private devastation around the assault on her husband. With it, she delivers a grave warning that the casual mockery and mimicry of political violence in America is chasing a generation from public service.

""The current climate of threats and attacks must stop,"" Pelosi writes.

""We cannot ask people to serve in public life if the cost is risking the safety of their families and those they love.""

Pelosi's book pages through familiar terrain for those who have followed the 84-year-old's career, rising from ""housewife to House member to House speaker."" The steely California Democrat, the speaker emerita, is no longer in leadership but running for reelection to the House this fall.

She twice won the speakers gavel, worked alongside seven presidents and, more recently, played a pivotal role in quietly convincing President Joe Biden to reassess his decision to remain in the 2024 presidential election rematch with Republican Donald Trump. Biden bowed out.

But it's the first and final chapters that bring a new element to the Pelosi era, detailing in personal and painstaking ways the toll that America's violent strain is taking on civic life and public service.

""I don't know that we will ever feel safe,"" she writes.

Written well before the July assassination attempt on Trump, Pelosi's assessment of the nation's dangerous discourse arrives after back-to-back congressional shootings of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise and earlier of Democratic former Rep. Gabby Giffords, and it serves as a walk-off warning in what could be among her final years in Congress.

Pelosi recounts her disbelief at being ""pulled off the Speaker's platform"" and out of the House chamber by security the afternoon of Jan. 6 as rioters sent by Trump stormed through the halls, some searching for her.

""I can handle it,"" she protested, telling U.S. Capitol Police she wanted to stay and finish the work as Congress was certifying the 2020 election.

""Their response was curt,"" she writes. ""'No, you can't.'""

After being whisked away to safety at Fort McNair, she writes about huddling with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the three of them desperately calling the Pentagon to send National Guard troops to restore order at the Capitol. She describes House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump loyalist, as almost entirely unseen.

So worried about the rioters' threats against Vice President Mike Pence in hiding at the Capitol, she called and told him, ""Don't let anybody know where you are.""

""It still took three hours from the time I was dragged out of the House chamber for the Guard to arrive at the Capitol complex,"" she writes. ""It took about three and a half hours to clear the rioters from the building.""

Later, surveying the wreckage of broken glass and splintered wood, she was told of blood outside the Speaker's Lobby. In some places, including her office, the mob had ""literally defecated on the floors and rugs,"" she wrote. ""What was left behind was pure destruction.""

She recalled being in war zones, and in Kyiv at the start of the Russian invasion thinking she may well die in Ukraine. ""I briefly thought the same on January 6,"" she wrote.

""When I became Speaker, I knew that I was making myself into a target,"" she writes. ""However, our accepting the risk is something that is fundamentally different for our families.""

Not quite two years later, she was awakened in the middle of the night by the ""Knock. Knock. Knock. Pound, Pound. Pound,"" of the Capitol Police security detail at her door in Washington.

""The officers' expressions were grim,"" she writes.

""It's Mr. Pelosi. He's been attacked in your home.""

""Is he okay?""

""We don't know.""

""Is he alive?""

""We don't know.""

Pelosi recounts the dizzying hours, frantic family phone calls and flight back to San Francisco, the hospital, the surgeries and the long recovery for her husband. Their youngest daughter said he looked like a bandaged-up Frankenstein.

Her son, Paul Jr., went to the family's home to vacuum up the broken glass and clean up the blood. Her daughter Alexandra, who had been a high schooler when Pelosi first ran for Congress, told her, had she known what they were signing up for she would ""never have given you my blessing.""

The attacker was tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. But Pelosi writes, the story of Paul's attack would not go away.

""Our home remains a heartbreaking crime scene,"" she wrote.

Pelosi said her children told her that for a long time Paul would only sleep in the bedroom when she was there. He still suffers from headaches and dizzy spells, and she said she has seen him faint and fall twice from vertigo. As of February, she wrote, she was still changing bandages from surgery on his arm.

But the ""true horror"" she writes was the dehumanizing jokes by Republicans from Trump on down, including the former president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who posted a Paul Pelosi Halloween costume to social media, and the way the crowds would ""laugh, cheer, and applaud"" their cruel remarks.

""It made me profoundly sad for our country,"" she writes.

Pelosi situates the two bloody episodes in the arc of her career, from the way Republicans vilified her in countless campaign ads from the time she first rose as Democratic leader to the way protesters spit on Democrats, including civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, the day the House voted for the Affordable Care Act, to the severed pig's head left outside her family's home in the days before Jan. 6.

Pelosi writes that when she speaks to young people about running for office, ""especially young women, too often I hear their reluctance to put their families in harm's way.""

""This is not the way our country should be -- if you engage in public service, you should not be a target, and your family should not be a target.""","{'uri': ['lisa_mascaro@santamariatimes.com'], 'name': ['Lisa Mascaro'], 'type': ['author'], 'isAgency': [False]}",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/santamariatimes.com/content/tncms/custom/image/b9c888ca-59a2-11eb-a31f-0b4d74fa96dc.jpg?resize=200%2C200,-0.4431,460614574,1,santamariatimes.com,news,Santa Maria Times,,2024-08-06

Not quite two years later, the threat of political violence would come for her husband at their home.

""Where's Nancy? Where's Nancy?""

That was the chilling question the intruder posed to Paul Pelosi before bludgeoning the then-82-year-old over the head with a hammer in their San Francisco house. It echoed the menacing jeers of the rioters roaming the halls of the Capitol calling out ""Nancy, Nancy"" on Jan. 6.

The through line of escalating political rhetoric and violence in American public life serves as the opening and closing message of Pelosi's new book, ""The Art of Power, My Story as America's First Woman Speaker of the House.""

Pelosi recounts her nearly four-decade legislative record in Congress but also allows a rare public glimpse into the private devastation around the assault on her husband. With it, she delivers a grave warning that the casual mockery and mimicry of political violence in America is chasing a generation from public service.

""The current climate of threats and attacks must stop,"" Pelosi writes.

""We cannot ask people to serve in public life if the cost is risking the safety of their families and those they love.""

Pelosi's book pages through familiar terrain for those who have followed the 84-year-old's career, rising from ""housewife to House member to House speaker."" The steely California Democrat, the speaker emerita, is no longer in leadership but running for reelection to the House this fall.

She twice won the speakers gavel, worked alongside seven presidents and, more recently, played a pivotal role in quietly convincing President Joe Biden to reassess his decision to remain in the 2024 presidential election rematch with Republican Donald Trump. Biden bowed out.

But it's the first and final chapters that bring a new element to the Pelosi era, detailing in personal and painstaking ways the toll that America's violent strain is taking on civic life and public service.

""I don't know that we will ever feel safe,"" she writes.

Written well before the July assassination attempt on Trump, Pelosi's assessment of the nation's dangerous discourse arrives after back-to-back congressional shootings of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise and earlier of Democratic former Rep. Gabby Giffords, and it serves as a walk-off warning in what could be among her final years in Congress.

Pelosi recounts her disbelief at being ""pulled off the Speaker's platform"" and out of the House chamber by security the afternoon of Jan. 6 as rioters sent by Trump stormed through the halls, some searching for her.

""I can handle it,"" she protested, telling U.S. Capitol Police she wanted to stay and finish the work as Congress was certifying the 2020 election.

""Their response was curt,"" she writes. ""'No, you can't.'""

After being whisked away to safety at Fort McNair, she writes about huddling with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the three of them desperately calling the Pentagon to send National Guard troops to restore order at the Capitol. She describes House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump loyalist, as almost entirely unseen.

So worried about the rioters' threats against Vice President Mike Pence in hiding at the Capitol, she called and told him, ""Don't let anybody know where you are.""

""It still took three hours from the time I was dragged out of the House chamber for the Guard to arrive at the Capitol complex,"" she writes. ""It took about three and a half hours to clear the rioters from the building.""

Later, surveying the wreckage of broken glass and splintered wood, she was told of blood outside the Speaker's Lobby. In some places, including her office, the mob had ""literally defecated on the floors and rugs,"" she wrote. ""What was left behind was pure destruction.""

She recalled being in war zones, and in Kyiv at the start of the Russian invasion thinking she may well die in Ukraine. ""I briefly thought the same on January 6,"" she wrote.

""When I became Speaker, I knew that I was making myself into a target,"" she writes. ""However, our accepting the risk is something that is fundamentally different for our families.""

Not quite two years later, she was awakened in the middle of the night by the ""Knock. Knock. Knock. Pound, Pound. Pound,"" of the Capitol Police security detail at her door in Washington.

Pelosi recounts the dizzying hours, frantic family phone calls and flight back to San Francisco, the hospital, the surgeries and the long recovery for her husband. Their youngest daughter said he looked like a bandaged-up Frankenstein.

Her son, Paul Jr., went to the family's home to vacuum up the broken glass and clean up the blood. Her daughter Alexandra, who had been a high schooler when Pelosi first ran for Congress, told her, had she known what they were signing up for she would ""never have given you my blessing.""

The attacker was tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. But Pelosi writes, the story of Paul's attack would not go away.

""Our home remains a heartbreaking crime scene,"" she wrote.

Pelosi said her children told her that for a long time Paul would only sleep in the bedroom when she was there. He still suffers from headaches and dizzy spells, and she said she has seen him faint and fall twice from vertigo. As of February, she wrote, she was still changing bandages from surgery on his arm.

But the ""true horror"" she writes was the dehumanizing jokes by Republicans from Trump on down, including the former president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who posted a Paul Pelosi Halloween costume to social media, and the way the crowds would ""laugh, cheer, and applaud"" their cruel remarks.

""It made me profoundly sad for our country,"" she writes.

Pelosi situates the two bloody episodes in the arc of her career, from the way Republicans vilified her in countless campaign ads from the time she first rose as Democratic leader to the way protesters spit on Democrats, including civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, the day the House voted for the Affordable Care Act, to the severed pig's head left outside her family's home in the days before Jan. 6.

Pelosi writes that when she speaks to young people about running for office, ""especially young women, too often I hear their reluctance to put their families in harm's way.""

""Is he okay?""

""We don't know.""

""We don't know.""

Pelosi recounts the dizzying hours, frantic family phone calls and flight back to San Francisco, the hospital, the surgeries and the long recovery for her husband. Their youngest daughter said he looked like a bandaged-up Frankenstein.

Her son, Paul Jr., went to the family's home to vacuum up the broken glass and clean up the blood. Her daughter Alexandra, who had been a high schooler when Pelosi first ran for Congress, told her, had she known what they were signing up for she would ""never have given you my blessing.""

The attacker was tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. But Pelosi writes, the story of Paul's attack would not go away.

""Our home remains a heartbreaking crime scene,"" she wrote.

Pelosi said her children told her that for a long time Paul would only sleep in the bedroom when she was there. He still suffers from headaches and dizzy spells, and she said she has seen him faint and fall twice from vertigo. As of February, she wrote, she was still changing bandages from surgery on his arm.

But the ""true horror"" she writes was the dehumanizing jokes by Republicans from Trump on down, including the former president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who posted a Paul Pelosi Halloween costume to social media, and the way the crowds would ""laugh, cheer, and applaud"" their cruel remarks.

""It made me profoundly sad for our country,"" she writes.

Pelosi situates the two bloody episodes in the arc of her career, from the way Republicans vilified her in countless campaign ads from the time she first rose as Democratic leader to the way protesters spit on Democrats, including civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, the day the House voted for the Affordable Care Act, to the severed pig's head left outside her family's home in the days before Jan. 6.

Pelosi writes that when she speaks to young people about running for office, ""especially young women, too often I hear their reluctance to put their families in harm's way.""

Not quite two years later, the threat of political violence would come for her husband at their home.

""Where's Nancy? Where's Nancy?""

That was the chilling question the intruder posed to Paul Pelosi before bludgeoning the then-82-year-old over the head with a hammer in their San Francisco house. It echoed the menacing jeers of the rioters roaming the halls of the Capitol calling out ""Nancy, Nancy"" on Jan. 6.

The through line of escalating political rhetoric and violence in American public life serves as the opening and closing message of Pelosi's new book, ""The Art of Power, My Story as America's First Woman Speaker of the House.""

Pelosi recounts her nearly four-decade legislative record in Congress but also allows a rare public glimpse into the private devastation around the assault on her husband. With it, she delivers a grave warning that the casual mockery and mimicry of political violence in America is chasing a generation from public service.

""The current climate of threats and attacks must stop,"" Pelosi writes.

""We cannot ask people to serve in public life if the cost is risking the safety of their families and those they love.""

Pelosi's book pages through familiar terrain for those who have followed the 84-year-old's career, rising from ""housewife to House member to House speaker."" The steely California Democrat, the speaker emerita, is no longer in leadership but running for reelection to the House this fall.

She twice won the speakers gavel, worked alongside seven presidents and, more recently, played a pivotal role in quietly convincing President Joe Biden to reassess his decision to remain in the 2024 presidential election rematch with Republican Donald Trump. Biden bowed out.

But it's the first and final chapters that bring a new element to the Pelosi era, detailing in personal and painstaking ways the toll that America's violent strain is taking on civic life and public service.

""I don't know that we will ever feel safe,"" she writes.

Written well before the July assassination attempt on Trump, Pelosi's assessment of the nation's dangerous discourse arrives after back-to-back congressional shootings of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise and earlier of Democratic former Rep. Gabby Giffords, and it serves as a walk-off warning in what could be among her final years in Congress.

Pelosi recounts her disbelief at being ""pulled off the Speaker's platform"" and out of the House chamber by security the afternoon of Jan. 6 as rioters sent by Trump stormed through the halls, some searching for her.

""I can handle it,"" she protested, telling U.S. Capitol Police she wanted to stay and finish the work as Congress was certifying the 2020 election.

""Their response was curt,"" she writes. ""'No, you can't.'""

After being whisked away to safety at Fort McNair, she writes about huddling with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the three of them desperately calling the Pentagon to send National Guard troops to restore order at the Capitol. She describes House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump loyalist, as almost entirely unseen.

So worried about the rioters' threats against Vice President Mike Pence in hiding at the Capitol, she called and told him, ""Don't let anybody know where you are.""

Not quite two years later, the threat of political violence would come for her husband at their home.

""Where's Nancy? Where's Nancy?""

That was the chilling question the intruder posed to Paul Pelosi before bludgeoning the then-82-year-old over the head with a hammer in their San Francisco house. It echoed the menacing jeers of the rioters roaming the halls of the Capitol calling out ""Nancy, Nancy"" on Jan. 6.

The through line of escalating political rhetoric and violence in American public life serves as the opening and closing message of Pelosi's new book, ""The Art of Power, My Story as America's First Woman Speaker of the House.""

Pelosi recounts her nearly four-decade legislative record in Congress but also allows a rare public glimpse into the private devastation around the assault on her husband. With it, she delivers a grave warning that the casual mockery and mimicry of political violence in America is chasing a generation from public service.

""The current climate of threats and attacks must stop,"" Pelosi writes.

""We cannot ask people to serve in public life if the cost is risking the safety of their families and those they love.""

Pelosi's book pages through familiar terrain for those who have followed the 84-year-old's career, rising from ""housewife to House member to House speaker."" The steely California Democrat, the speaker emerita, is no longer in leadership but running for reelection to the House this fall.

She twice won the speakers gavel, worked alongside seven presidents and, more recently, played a pivotal role in quietly convincing President Joe Biden to reassess his decision to remain in the 2024 presidential election rematch with Republican Donald Trump. Biden bowed out.

But it's the first and final chapters that bring a new element to the Pelosi era, detailing in personal and painstaking ways the toll that America's violent strain is taking on civic life and public service.

""I don't know that we will ever feel safe,"" she writes.

Written well before the July assassination attempt on Trump, Pelosi's assessment of the nation's dangerous discourse arrives after back-to-back congressional shootings of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise and earlier of Democratic former Rep. Gabby Giffords, and it serves as a walk-off warning in what could be among her final years in Congress.

Pelosi recounts her disbelief at being ""pulled off the Speaker's platform"" and out of the House chamber by security the afternoon of Jan. 6 as rioters sent by Trump stormed through the halls, some searching for her.

""I can handle it,"" she protested, telling U.S. Capitol Police she wanted to stay and finish the work as Congress was certifying the 2020 election.

""Their response was curt,"" she writes. ""'No, you can't.'""

After being whisked away to safety at Fort McNair, she writes about huddling with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the three of them desperately calling the Pentagon to send National Guard troops to restore order at the Capitol. She describes House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump loyalist, as almost entirely unseen.

So worried about the rioters' threats against Vice President Mike Pence in hiding at the Capitol, she called and told him, ""Don't let anybody know where you are.""

""It still took three hours from the time I was dragged out of the House chamber for the Guard to arrive at the Capitol complex,"" she writes. ""It took about three and a half hours to clear the rioters from the building.""

Later, surveying the wreckage of broken glass and splintered wood, she was told of blood outside the Speaker's Lobby. In some places, including her office, the mob had ""literally defecated on the floors and rugs,"" she wrote. ""What was left behind was pure destruction.""

She recalled being in war zones, and in Kyiv at the start of the Russian invasion thinking she may well die in Ukraine. ""I briefly thought the same on January 6,"" she wrote.

""When I became Speaker, I knew that I was making myself into a target,"" she writes. ""However, our accepting the risk is something that is fundamentally different for our families.""

Not quite two years later, she was awakened in the middle of the night by the ""Knock. Knock. Knock. Pound, Pound. Pound,"" of the Capitol Police security detail at her door in Washington.

Pelosi recounts the dizzying hours, frantic family phone calls and flight back to San Francisco, the hospital, the surgeries and the long recovery for her husband. Their youngest daughter said he looked like a bandaged-up Frankenstein.

Her son, Paul Jr., went to the family's home to vacuum up the broken glass and clean up the blood. Her daughter Alexandra, who had been a high schooler when Pelosi first ran for Congress, told her, had she known what they were signing up for she would ""never have given you my blessing.""

The attacker was tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. But Pelosi writes, the story of Paul's attack would not go away.

""Our home remains a heartbreaking crime scene,"" she wrote.

Pelosi said her children told her that for a long time Paul would only sleep in the bedroom when she was there. He still suffers from headaches and dizzy spells, and she said she has seen him faint and fall twice from vertigo. As of February, she wrote, she was still changing bandages from surgery on his arm.

But the ""true horror"" she writes was the dehumanizing jokes by Republicans from Trump on down, including the former president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who posted a Paul Pelosi Halloween costume to social media, and the way the crowds would ""laugh, cheer, and applaud"" their cruel remarks.

""It made me profoundly sad for our country,"" she writes.

Pelosi situates the two bloody episodes in the arc of her career, from the way Republicans vilified her in countless campaign ads from the time she first rose as Democratic leader to the way protesters spit on Democrats, including civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, the day the House voted for the Affordable Care Act, to the severed pig's head left outside her family's home in the days before Jan. 6.

""I can handle it,"" she protested, telling U.S. Capitol Police she wanted to stay and finish the work as Congress was certifying the 2020 election.

""Their response was curt,"" she writes. ""'No, you can't.'""

After being whisked away to safety at Fort McNair, she writes about huddling with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the three of them desperately calling the Pentagon to send National Guard troops to restore order at the Capitol. She describes House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump loyalist, as almost entirely unseen.

So worried about the rioters' threats against Vice President Mike Pence in hiding at the Capitol, she called and told him, ""Don't let anybody know where you are.""

""It still took three hours from the time I was dragged out of the House chamber for the Guard to arrive at the Capitol complex,"" she writes. ""It took about three and a half hours to clear the rioters from the building.""

Later, surveying the wreckage of broken glass and splintered wood, she was told of blood outside the Speaker's Lobby. In some places, including her office, the mob had ""literally defecated on the floors and rugs,"" she wrote. ""What was left behind was pure destruction.""

She recalled being in war zones, and in Kyiv at the start of the Russian invasion thinking she may well die in Ukraine. ""I briefly thought the same on January 6,"" she wrote.

""When I became Speaker, I knew that I was making myself into a target,"" she writes. ""However, our accepting the risk is something that is fundamentally different for our families.""

Not quite two years later, she was awakened in the middle of the night by the ""Knock. Knock. Knock. Pound, Pound. Pound,"" of the Capitol Police security detail at her door in Washington.

Pelosi recounts the dizzying hours, frantic family phone calls and flight back to San Francisco, the hospital, the surgeries and the long recovery for her husband. Their youngest daughter said he looked like a bandaged-up Frankenstein.

Her son, Paul Jr., went to the family's home to vacuum up the broken glass and clean up the blood. Her daughter Alexandra, who had been a high schooler when Pelosi first ran for Congress, told her, had she known what they were signing up for she would ""never have given you my blessing.""

The attacker was tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. But Pelosi writes, the story of Paul's attack would not go away.

""Our home remains a heartbreaking crime scene,"" she wrote.

Pelosi said her children told her that for a long time Paul would only sleep in the bedroom when she was there. He still suffers from headaches and dizzy spells, and she said she has seen him faint and fall twice from vertigo. As of February, she wrote, she was still changing bandages from surgery on his arm.

But the ""true horror"" she writes was the dehumanizing jokes by Republicans from Trump on down, including the former president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who posted a Paul Pelosi Halloween costume to social media, and the way the crowds would ""laugh, cheer, and applaud"" their cruel remarks.

""It made me profoundly sad for our country,"" she writes.

Pelosi situates the two bloody episodes in the arc of her career, from the way Republicans vilified her in countless campaign ads from the time she first rose as Democratic leader to the way protesters spit on Democrats, including civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, the day the House voted for the Affordable Care Act, to the severed pig's head left outside her family's home in the days before Jan. 6.

Pelosi writes that when she speaks to young people about running for office, ""especially young women, too often I hear their reluctance to put their families in harm's way.""

Not quite two years later, the threat of political violence would come for her husband at their home.

""Where's Nancy? Where's Nancy?""

That was the chilling question the intruder posed to Paul Pelosi before bludgeoning the then-82-year-old over the head with a hammer in their San Francisco house. It echoed the menacing jeers of the rioters roaming the halls of the Capitol calling out ""Nancy, Nancy"" on Jan. 6.

The through line of escalating political rhetoric and violence in American public life serves as the opening and closing message of Pelosi's new book, ""The Art of Power, My Story as America's First Woman Speaker of the House.""

Pelosi recounts her nearly four-decade legislative record in Congress but also allows a rare public glimpse into the private devastation around the assault on her husband. With it, she delivers a grave warning that the casual mockery and mimicry of political violence in America is chasing a generation from public service.

""The current climate of threats and attacks must stop,"" Pelosi writes.

She twice won the speakers gavel, worked alongside seven presidents and, more recently, played a pivotal role in quietly convincing President Joe Biden to reassess his decision to remain in the 2024 presidential election rematch with Republican Donald Trump. Biden bowed out.

But it's the first and final chapters that bring a new element to the Pelosi era, detailing in personal and painstaking ways the toll that America's violent strain is taking on civic life and public service.

Not quite two years later, the threat of political violence would come for her husband at their home.

""Where's Nancy? Where's Nancy?""

That was the chilling question the intruder posed to Paul Pelosi before bludgeoning the then-82-year-old over the head with a hammer in their San Francisco house. It echoed the menacing jeers of the rioters roaming the halls of the Capitol calling out ""Nancy, Nancy"" on Jan. 6.

The through line of escalating political rhetoric and violence in American public life serves as the opening and closing message of Pelosi's new book, ""The Art of Power, My Story as America's First Woman Speaker of the House.""

Pelosi recounts her nearly four-decade legislative record in Congress but also allows a rare public glimpse into the private devastation around the assault on her husband. With it, she delivers a grave warning that the casual mockery and mimicry of political violence in America is chasing a generation from public service.

""The current climate of threats and attacks must stop,"" Pelosi writes.

""We cannot ask people to serve in public life if the cost is risking the safety of their families and those they love.""

Pelosi's book pages through familiar terrain for those who have followed the 84-year-old's career, rising from ""housewife to House member to House speaker."" The steely California Democrat, the speaker emerita, is no longer in leadership but running for reelection to the House this fall.

She twice won the speakers gavel, worked alongside seven presidents and, more recently, played a pivotal role in quietly convincing President Joe Biden to reassess his decision to remain in the 2024 presidential election rematch with Republican Donald Trump. Biden bowed out.

But it's the first and final chapters that bring a new element to the Pelosi era, detailing in personal and painstaking ways the toll that America's violent strain is taking on civic life and public service.

""I don't know that we will ever feel safe,"" she writes.

Written well before the July assassination attempt on Trump, Pelosi's assessment of the nation's dangerous discourse arrives after back-to-back congressional shootings of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise and earlier of Democratic former Rep. Gabby Giffords, and it serves as a walk-off warning in what could be among her final years in Congress.

Pelosi recounts her disbelief at being ""pulled off the Speaker's platform"" and out of the House chamber by security the afternoon of Jan. 6 as rioters sent by Trump stormed through the halls, some searching for her.

""I can handle it,"" she protested, telling U.S. Capitol Police she wanted to stay and finish the work as Congress was certifying the 2020 election.

""Their response was curt,"" she writes. ""'No, you can't.'""

After being whisked away to safety at Fort McNair, she writes about huddling with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the three of them desperately calling the Pentagon to send National Guard troops to restore order at the Capitol. She describes House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump loyalist, as almost entirely unseen.

So worried about the rioters' threats against Vice President Mike Pence in hiding at the Capitol, she called and told him, ""Don't let anybody know where you are.""

""It still took three hours from the time I was dragged out of the House chamber for the Guard to arrive at the Capitol complex,"" she writes. ""It took about three and a half hours to clear the rioters from the building.""

Later, surveying the wreckage of broken glass and splintered wood, she was told of blood outside the Speaker's Lobby. In some places, including her office, the mob had ""literally defecated on the floors and rugs,"" she wrote. ""What was left behind was pure destruction.""

She recalled being in war zones, and in Kyiv at the start of the Russian invasion thinking she may well die in Ukraine. ""I briefly thought the same on January 6,"" she wrote.

""When I became Speaker, I knew that I was making myself into a target,"" she writes. ""However, our accepting the risk is something that is fundamentally different for our families.""

Not quite two years later, she was awakened in the middle of the night by the ""Knock. Knock. Knock. Pound, Pound. Pound,"" of the Capitol Police security detail at her door in Washington.

Pelosi recounts the dizzying hours, frantic family phone calls and flight back to San Francisco, the hospital, the surgeries and the long recovery for her husband. Their youngest daughter said he looked like a bandaged-up Frankenstein.

Her son, Paul Jr., went to the family's home to vacuum up the broken glass and clean up the blood. Her daughter Alexandra, who had been a high schooler when Pelosi first ran for Congress, told her, had she known what they were signing up for she would ""never have given you my blessing.""

The attacker was tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. But Pelosi writes, the story of Paul's attack would not go away.

""Our home remains a heartbreaking crime scene,"" she wrote.

Pelosi said her children told her that for a long time Paul would only sleep in the bedroom when she was there. He still suffers from headaches and dizzy spells, and she said she has seen him faint and fall twice from vertigo. As of February, she wrote, she was still changing bandages from surgery on his arm.

But the ""true horror"" she writes was the dehumanizing jokes by Republicans from Trump on down, including the former president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who posted a Paul Pelosi Halloween costume to social media, and the way the crowds would ""laugh, cheer, and applaud"" their cruel remarks.

""It made me profoundly sad for our country,"" she writes.

Pelosi situates the two bloody episodes in the arc of her career, from the way Republicans vilified her in countless campaign ads from the time she first rose as Democratic leader to the way protesters spit on Democrats, including civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, the day the House voted for the Affordable Care Act, to the severed pig's head left outside her family's home in the days before Jan. 6.

Pelosi writes that when she speaks to young people about running for office, ""especially young women, too often I hear their reluctance to put their families in harm's way.""

A wave of anxiety rippled through financial markets yesterday, and stocks fell around the world as investors zeroed in on signs of a slowing American economy.

The drop extended a sell-off that began on Friday after the U.S. released a job report that showed the highest level of unemployment in nearly three years. That deepened fears that the world's largest economy could be headed for slower growth.

There were other factors at play in the plunge: concerns that tech stocks had run up too far, too fast, and that a strengthening yen could hurt the prospects of Japanese companies and some global traders. In the U.S., some questioned whether the Federal Reserve might have waited too long to cut interest rates. Here's the latest on the market meltdown.

By the numbers: In the U.S., the S&P 500 fell 3 percent, its worst day since September 2022. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index dropped 12.4 percent, its biggest one-day point decline. The FTSE 100, Britain's benchmark index, had its worst day since July 2023, falling just over 2 percent.

Time to sell? It's tough to do nothing during this kind of market turmoil. But in this case, it's your best option, Ron Lieber, our columnist, writes.

A scramble to avoid wider war in the Middle East

Diplomats across the Middle East are working to contain escalating tensions between Israel and Iran as fears of a widening conflict grow in the region after Iran vowed revenge for the killing of a senior Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, on its soil.

The U.S. defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, has ordered more combat aircraft and missile-shooting warships to the Middle East in response to threats to Israel from Iran and its proxies, and President Biden convened his national security team to discuss developments in the region and spoke with King Abdullah II of Jordan, according to a White House statement.

Foreign ministers from Islamic countries are to gather in Saudi Arabia tomorrow for an ""extraordinary"" meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation that was called to discuss ""the continued crimes of the Israeli occupation against the Palestinian people,"" including Haniyeh's killing, the organization said in a statement.

Quotable: ""We must be prepared for anything -- including a swift transition to offense,"" said Yoav Gallant, Israel's defense minister.

In Lebanon: Hezbollah and Israel continued to trade cross-border fire, with an Israeli airstrike killing two people in southern Lebanon, according to Lebanon's Ministry of Health.

In Israel: A quarrel between Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over Israel's approach to cease-fire talks mirrors growing domestic tensions.

🇺🇸 2024

The presidential election is less than 100 days away. Here's the latest from the campaign trail.

Harris is poised to announce her running mate

The campaign to be Kamala Harris's running mate is reaching its last hours. The final stage has reached something of an ugly phase, sowing divisions within the party as donors, interest groups and political rivals lobby for their preferred candidates.

Three contenders -- Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona and Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota -- met with the vice president in Washington on Sunday. After announcing her pick, Harris plans to hold a first rally with her new running mate in Philadelphia today.

Here's what else to know:

The elevation of Harris to the top of the Democratic ticket has transformed what had been a long slog into a fast-moving campaign. Analysts said that the timeline was likely to benefit Harris.

In a live interview with Adin Ross, a 23-year-old internet streamer, Donald Trump appeared to blame immigrants for the drop in global stock markets.

In a new book, Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker, said that her push for President Biden to withdraw had come down to one factor: the need to defeat Donald Trump.

IN SEPTEMBER of 2022, this writer was fortunate enough to pen a tribute piece to John Farnham amidst his shocking cancer diagnoses. Reflecting on his great achievements, musical hero status and what he meant to ordinary people, it willed him a strong recovery.

Such was the timing and popularity of the man himself that some 75,000 strong readers took in the content, later ranked as IA's article of the year. When the legendary figure's iconic musical melody later featured in the ""Yes"" campaign just prior to Australia's Voice Referendum last year, a follow-up piece was written about how the superstar represented a voice for change.

Somewhat optimistically, that opinion editorial welcomed the transition home amidst a stir of ""beat up"" controversy about turning an iconic party anthem into part of a larger political movement. Despite the Referendum failing to come to fruition, the advertisement proved hugely popular -- and rightfully so. Then on Thursday, as Australia woke, Johnny was back -- but this time on the world stage.

One glance at the morning socials was enough to tell you he had done it again. His iconic 'You're the Voice' anthem was up and about and trending again -- just one more, ""last"" time. A new craftily designed viral music video clip was doing the rounds. Opening with unfavourable Trumpisms, the clip made a strong political statement.

It depicted the need for the American Democratic Party to pass on the torch of change from President Joe Biden to Vice President Kamala Harris, for a generation of progressive and diverse leaders to ultimately gift the people hope for a better future. Perhaps one could presume with a bit more senility than the first two presidential contenders, from times long past.

One would then hopefully be free from fear of the little things. Like risking an all-out nuclear world war through a lack of basic diplomacy. Then, overnight, an armchair hacktivist and musical sentimentalist's dream conspired to come true. One could feel the full force of this rumbling excitement in their nerdish but democratic ""old school"" musical loins. Finally! Something that may outstrip Gough Whitlam's 'It's Time' jingle of its former glory at the helm of political marketing and pop culture genius.

This new clip appeared punchy and the torch reference was particularly timely, considering many just watched the Olympic ceremony. The masses could, of course, be forgiven for mistakenly believing our main man Johnny was now front, stage and centre in a Democrat-endorsed ad for Kamala Harris' U.S. Presidential Election bid. Although that wasn't the exact reality.

It was, in fact, an unofficial advertisement that for all intent and purposes could well have been mocked up in a loungeroom of an old HP laptop, although Independent Australia cannot confirm such detail. Regardless, it didn't worry the people. For the two-minute and 15-second duration of the video, we reminisced and got caught up in the unification, joy and emotion of the togetherness.

#1 TOP IA STORY OF 2022: John Farnham -- The Voice of Australia

John Farnham was close to death earlier this year and so our top story of 2022 receiving over 75,000 views reflected the depth of affection in our nation for the iconic Australian vocalist. Well done to Naomi Fryers for so brilliantly capturing this love in this moving September piece.

We may as well have been hugging our mates in the pub after some kind of show of lifesaving comradery, for we were all the voice, yet again. It wasn't even initially obvious that the lyrics about not wanting to look at each other down the barrel of the gun were glaringly ironic in the wake of the Trump assassination attempt.

True to form though, the grubby imperialist Poms were quick to try to dust the gloss off this quintessentially momentous Aussie moment by, quite typically, whinging and claiming the singer as theirs -- just like the Ashes and everything else in Australia's longest-living history.

The reason that this advertisement labelled 'outstanding' commenced trending and ultimately went viral was that the music resonated, seemingly as much with a global audience as it did in Australia. Such was its power that it reportedly gave people goosebumps. The fact that it was cleverly constructed unofficially by a trickster likely had no bearing on the good old chain reaction.

The anthem was emotively the best of us and it was seen. With it came the relatable gift of unification, reminiscence and hope. From the likes of Joe Biden to Kamala Harris, to John Farnham himself and X patrons on the old Twittersphere. It brought back the voice -- and not just to Australia. This time the world responded and who could blame them for wanting more of it?

Expert sees trouble,"Lansing -- Widespread change has struck the group of officials whose job is to certify Michigan's elections, igniting concerns about whether the new class is willing to sign off on the results the same way county canvassers in the battleground state did four years ago.

A first-of-its-kind, weeks-long analysis by The Detroit News found 55% of the 332 county canvassers in Michigan were not serving in November 2020 when boards in all 83 counties approved the outcome despite Republican then-President Donald Trump's unsuccessful attempt to overturn his loss to Democrat Joe Biden.

The turnover has been driven by Republicans. While 48% of the Democratic canvassers are new since 2020, 63% -- nearly two out of every three -- are new on the GOP side, according to The News' analysis.

The numbers point to a Michigan Republican Party that's been focused on false claims of widespread fraud aimed at the 2020 election and GOP canvassers who might interfere with the election process this fall, according to Democrats. But Republicans, such as Kalamazoo County canvasser Robert Froman, said the analysis demonstrates an increased and renewed interest in how elections are administered.

""Many people within the framework or the ideology of the Republican Party have realized that they have been sitting in their living rooms way too long, and the country that they know and love is being stolen out from under them,"" Froman said. ""And they're not willing to sit in their living rooms any longer.""

Froman, a 72-year-old retired postal service employee from Oshtemo Township, is one of the 105 new Republican county canvassers who are serving in 2024 but weren't in their positions in 2020.

Each county in Michigan has a four-person canvassing board, featuring two Republicans and two Democrats, in charge of approving election tallies before they're forwarded to the state for final authorization. The panels rarely get attention and, former Michigan elections director Chris Thomas said, their members often held the posts for many years at a time, making vast changes like what's occurred recently unusual.

Concerns about the 2020 election spurred Froman to get more actively involved in politics, he said. Froman started attending Kalamazoo County Republican Party meetings and volunteering with an entity named Check My Vote, which has been trying to examine and verify addresses used by Michigan residents in the state's official list of registered voters.

Froman, whom Republicans nominated to serve on the Kalamazoo County canvassing board and whose term began last year, said he's personally checked tens of thousands of voters' addresses. He said he ""most definitely"" believes the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.

Asked if he would certify the 2024 presidential election if it unfolded the same way the 2020 one did, Froman replied, ""No. And that's why I'm there.""

Froman is one of four so-called ""county leaders"" or ""trainers"" who have been working with Check My Vote to investigate the state's registered voter list and who have recently gotten county canvassing positions. The others are Bonnie Kellogg in Muskegon County, Maureen Hillary in Clinton County and Ron Palmgren in Genesee County, according to a list of ""county leaders"" in a July 2023 announcement from the Michigan Republican Party.

The belief system that there was widespread fraud in 2020 and a series of attempts to reject results in Michigan over the last four years have some election officials in Michigan expecting that Republicans on some local canvassing boards might try to block the certification process in November if Trump loses to likely Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.

County canvassing boards must have a bipartisan 3-1 or 4-0 vote to certify election results and advance them to the Board of State Canvassers, another panel comprised of two Republicans and two Democrats.

""At this point, shockingly, it wouldn't surprise me to see several counties deadlock,"" said Thomas, who served as Michigan's elections director for more than three decades.

'I do worry'

Each of Michigan's 83 county canvassing boards has the responsibility of reviewing the local vote totals and reporting the results to the Board of State Canvassers, according to a manual published by the Michigan Bureau of Elections.

The county boards, featuring two Republican slots and two Democratic slots, have 14 days following Election Day to certify the results for each of their precincts.

The canvassers serve staggered four-year terms, are nominated by their local political party and are picked, from among the party nominees, by the local board of commissioners. However, there is no official state list that tracks who sits on the key elections boards across Michigan.

The News compiled the names of Michigan's county canvassers -- those serving now and those serving in 2020 -- through questionnaires sent to county clerks in June and July and examining board member lists that were posted on some county websites.

Boards with vacancies are considered by The News to have new members because the positions are expected to be filled before the November election.

Of Michigan's 83 counties, 11 have completely new canvassing boards with four new members from 2020: Alger, Arenac, Clare, Dickinson, Iosco, Mackinac, Manistee, Montmorency, Muskegon, Roscommon and Wayne -- the state's most populous county and the site of a brief November 2020 certification deadlock.

In Iosco County, which is located in northeastern Michigan and has a population of about 25,000, Clerk Nancy Huebel said one past board member died, two resigned for personal reasons, and one, Democrat Patti Casey, wasn't reappointed.

In neighboring Arenac County, Janice Grier, 69, of Standish said Democrats were having trouble finding people to serve on the canvassing board a couple of years ago, so she stepped up. In 2020, 67% of the votes in the county went to Trump.

Grier said she hasn't seen anything that would make her concerned about the county board not certifying the upcoming presidential election, but she's not so certain about elsewhere in Michigan.

""I do worry about other parts of the state,"" Grier said.

Protect the vote?

Over the last four years, there have been three examples of canvassers in Michigan at least initially refusing to certify an election.

Most recently, in the spring, two Republicans on the Delta County canvassing board in the Upper Peninsula voted against certifying a May 7 recall election in which three incumbent Republican county commissioners lost their seats. However, days later, they changed course and approved the results.

""I am doing my best to protect the votes of all citizens of Delta County and to ensure free and fair elections by bringing transparency and reassurance to all Delta County citizens,"" one of the Republican canvassers, Bonnie Hakkola, said at the time.

Hakkola resigned from the board afterward.

The other Republican who initially voted against certification, LeeAnne Oman, was serving as an alternate for an absent GOP canvasser, Sema Deeds.

Jonathan Brater, Michigan's elections director, sent a letter to the Delta County canvassers on May 16, telling them that under the Michigan Constitution and state law, they had ""a clear and nondiscretionary duty to certify election results based solely on election returns.""

""The Constitution and Michigan election law do not authorize boards of county canvassers to refuse to certify election results based on claims made by third parties of alleged election irregularities or a general desire to conduct election investigations,"" Brater wrote in the letter.

In a statement in May, Attorney General Dana Nessel said ""defying the will of the people based on conjecture, dissatisfaction in the results or any other reason not based on Michigan law"" will not be tolerated.

""While the Delta County Board ultimately met their obligations, and as a result have avoided the legal consequences, let this serve as a warning to all of the boards of canvassers across the state that the willful neglect of your duties is a criminal act,"" added Nessel, a Democrat.

Canvassers' role

Asked about the statements from Nessel and Brater about the Delta County canvassers, new Republican Kalamazoo County canvasser Froman said he has a duty to ensure there is a free and fair election.

""I am not going to do anything that's illegal,"" Froman told The News.

Other new canvassers interviewed by The News in recent weeks made similar remarks.

Ron Palmgren, a Republican canvasser in Genesee County, has also served as a county leader for Check My Vote. Asked if the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Trump, Palmgren said he has ""no idea whether it was stolen or not.""

Biden won Michigan's election by 154,000 votes or 3 percentage points, 51%-48%. The outcome has been upheld by audits, a series of court rulings and an investigation by a Republican-controlled state Senate committee.

Palmgren, a 76-year-old retiree from Burton, said he views his role as a canvasser as being an ""impartial arbiter.""

""Based on my experience so far, there is no investigatory process,"" Palmgren said of his responsibilities. ""It is strictly looking at the election results provided by all of the municipalities and making sure that all of the processes that were in place were followed.""

Likewise, Jim Kargol, a 69-year-old from Petoskey who serves on the Emmet County Board of Canvassers, said he doesn't believe there's been fraud in local elections, but he questions what has happened in other places, such as Detroit.

Kargol mentioned a van dropping off loads of ballots in the night during the 2020 presidential election in Detroit, a Democratic stronghold. He appeared to be referencing about 16,000 ballots that had been delivered to the center where absentee ballots were being tallied in Detroit in the early morning hours of Nov. 4. The ballots had been verified by city Clerk Janice Winfrey's staff prior to delivery in a process prescribed by Michigan law, said Thomas, Michigan's former elections director who helped oversee voting in Detroit.

""I really think there was some foolishness that went on,"" said Kargol, a Republican.

Canvassing troubles

After the 2020 presidential election on Nov. 17, 2020, Wayne County's Republican then-canvassers Monica Palmer and William Hartmann questioned precincts in Detroit where the number of ballots cast and the number of votes tracked didn't match and initially voted against certifying the county's results.

But later in the meeting, they changed course and supported certifying the election based on the condition that an audit take place of some precincts within Wayne County.

Minutes after the meeting, Trump and Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel called Palmer and Hartmann, and Trump personally pressured them not to sign the certification document, according to recordings previously reported on by The Detroit News.

""We've got to fight for our country,"" Trump said during the phone call, according to the recordings. ""We can't let these people take our country away from us.""

More: Trump recorded pressuring Wayne County canvassers not to certify 2020 vote

The Michigan Bureau of Elections determined the vote that occurred and the signatures of the chair or vice chair of the four-member canvassing board and the county clerk were the only things necessary to advance the certification to the Board of State Canvassers.

Hartmann died in 2021, and Republican Party officials didn't renominate Palmer to serve on the canvassing board when her term concluded in 2021. The new Republican canvassers are Katherine Riley and Robert Boyd.

Riley, who's now chair of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers, according to the county's website, didn't respond Monday to a request for comment.

There are also two new Democrats on the board, Richard W. Preuss and Frank Woods Jr.

Jonathan Kinloch, a Democrat who was serving on the Wayne County canvassing board in 2020 and is now a Wayne County commissioner, said the question of whether boards will certify the results this fall is at the forefront of his mind.

Wayne County Republicans initially denied that they were going to attempt to block certification in 2020, Kinloch said. Where there's smoke, people should be concerned, he said.

""I think this is a tactic of theirs to create chaos,"" Kinloch said.

Legal backstops

If a county canvassing board refuses to certify an upcoming election, Michigan has legal ""backstops"" in place to deal with the development, Thomas said. But such an attempt could also further undermine people's faith in electoral outcomes, he acknowledged.

Under state processes, if a county board fails to determine a result, the job moves to the Board of State Canvassers, according to the Michigan Bureau of Elections.

The county board is supposed to immediately deliver all records and other information, including all necessary forms, to the Board of State Canvassers. A court could get involved to make sure that step happens.

When the 2020 presidential election reached the state board, one of the two Republicans on the statewide panel abstained: Norm Shinkle of Ingham County. But the other Republican, Aaron Van Langevelde, cast the deciding vote with the two Democrats in favor of certification.

At the time, Shinkle called for the Republican-led Legislature to conduct an in-depth review of election procedures, and he promoted theories about problems in Wayne County.

""I do not plan on voting for certification. I believe Wayne County's certification needs to be looked at,"" Shinkle said before abstaining.

Van Langevelde and Shinkle are both no longer on the board. They've been replaced by Tony Daunt and Richard Houskamp.

Daunt and Houskamp voted to certify the 2022 gubernatorial election, which Republican Tudor Dixon lost to Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer by about 10 percentage points. Daunt also has openly criticized Trump for spreading ""lies"" that the 2020 election was rigged.",[],"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/08/05/PDTN/74674332007-early-voting-muskegon-07.JPG?auto=webp&crop=5054,2842,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200",-0.1529,460610642,1,detroitnews.com,news,The Detroit News,,2024-08-06

DONALD TRUMP'S political popularity is not a backlash by disenfranchised voters suffering the ills of inequality. Trump's popularity is a movement based on the aggrieved entitlement of Americans who resent growing equality.

Trump offers these people - White men and often White women, too - the promise of pushing those with less power, women and non-White people, back down the ladder of inequality.

This means Trump is not the Left's fault. Trump is a reaction to the Left fighting for a more equal society.

It has become a popular trope amongst political analysts to blame the rise of Donald Trump's far-Right MAGA movement on the Democrats and the Left more broadly. The myth goes that Democratic presidents have not served the interests of the working class, particularly rural White American men, and that the resulting resentment about growing inequality led to the rise of Donald Trump.

America's gathering storm: Trump's culture of self-pity an ace up his sleeve

As unlikely as it seems that Donald Trump could be re-elected, his cult of personality could be enough to stir up votes and place him back in the Oval Office.

Sales says this divisive message resonates effectively with Trump's supporters because life has got harder for Americans with free trade disappearing jobs and industries, rising inflation, credit card defaults and bankruptcies, high interest rates and ""deaths of despair"" from suicide, alcoholism and drug addiction.

Not only does this representation of Trump's political support wrongly imply that Trump's base supports him because he is going to solve American inequality, but it also inaccurately implies that the Democrats do not work hard for equality.

Just like in Australian politics, what separates the Left from the Right in American politics is a desire by the Left to solve inequality, whereas the Right works to make it worse. This glaring fact is lost in attempts to blame Trump - a pro-inequality candidate - on those who oppose inequality at every turn.

Another example of attempts to apportion some blame for Trump's rise on the Democrats came from Stan Grant in The Saturday Paper. Grant takes aim at former President Barack Obama, criticising him for failing to solve race relations and inequality in America and saying Obama 'bequeathed a country primed for a populist like Trump'.

Big of him, Grant also lays a little bit of secondary blame on Trump, writing:

Race, gender, age will determine Kamala Harris' running mate

As Kamala Harris steps up to take on Donald Trump in the 2024 Presidential Election, political realities will determine who her running mate will be.

Grant's argument amounts to a claim that since Obama didn't solve inequality, particularly race inequality, it was only natural that Trump would exploit racism to win the 2016 Election.

Grant implies that solving inequality - supposedly doable within two four-year terms - is the Democrats' job and if they don't do that successfully, voters will naturally turn to the Republicans. These are the same Republicans who we all know have no intention of doing anything about inequality, but indeed are hellbent on making it worse.

As facts would have it, the American Council of Economic Advisors found in 2016 that the Obama Presidency carried out the 'most aggressive and successful attempt to reduce inequality in half a century'. On the other hand, just like the Right always does, Trump's Administration worked hard to increase inequality.

Whether he meant to or not, Grant did get close to describing the real reason Trump's MAGA movement grew out of Trump's racist, misogynistic promise to take America back to the past. Grant quotes political scientist George Friedman in saying White working-class voters rejected the Democratic ""elite"" because this elite attacked their churches' authoritative views as racist, sexist or homophobic.

This claim almost gets to the real reason why people support Trump, but misses a key point. The MAGA movement is not a backlash against ""elites"". At the heart of Trump's support is a backlash against those who fight for equality.

This includes some elites, but also, crucially, the victims of inequality themselves who unite in the movements against racism, sexism and homophobia, alongside struggles by the Left - including the union movement - to reduce income and wealth inequality.

Media has normalised Trump's bullying - it's time to take control

Presidential candidate Donald Trump has become notorious for his aggression and bullying, which the mainstream media is happy to ignore.

The vast majority of people in these movements, by the way, are suffering all the ills of inequality that Leigh Sales claims led to voters supporting Trump. What is the difference between them? Democrats fight for equality and Republicans fight against it. The fact is, MAGA is not just a political coalition premised on bigotry and hate, it is a sometimes-violent pushback against those who fight for a more equal society.

Grant might be right that the Obama Presidency influenced the rise of Trump, but he is offensively wrong about the reasons why. The true reason the MAGA base turned against Obama (if indeed any of them voted Democrat to start with) was because Obama was the symbolic face of American equality. MAGA voters could not fathom living in a society where a Black person could become President.

Trump's promise to ""Make America Great Again"" has always been an unspoken but constantly implied promise to make America more unequal again.

Just as Trump used Obama's race against him in his pro-inequality movement, he has already shown he plans to do the same to Vice President Kamala Harris. Harris symbolises race and gender equality. The MAGA movement could not accept a Black president and so it certainly can't accept a mixed-race, Black woman as leader.

Tropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia and the Carolinas

HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with torrential rain, high winds and flooding, contributing to at least five deaths as it turned menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatened to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities. Sarasota Police Department officials say about 500 residents were rescued from flooded homes. Record-setting rain was next expected to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Historic cities including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, are gearing up for potential high water. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 50 mph.

Ex-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped

PHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.

Japan's share benchmark soars nearly 11% a day after massive sell-offs that shook Wall Street

NEW YORK (AP) -- Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index has soared more than 10% a day after it set markets tumbling in Europe and on Wall Street, while other world markets appeared to have settled after the rollercoaster ride that started the week. The Japanese index fell back after its biggest early advance, gaining 8.7% by midmorning. On Monday, nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as world markets quaked under fears the U.S. economy is slowing too much. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed the Nikkei's 12.4% plunge, its worst since 1987.

Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.

Proxy forces armed by Iran could take part in retaliation against Israel over Hamas leader's killing

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- As Iran threatens to respond to the suspected Israeli assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, the regional militias that the Islamic Republic has armed for decades could play a role in any attack. They include Lebanon's Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels of Yemen, Shiite militias in Iraq and others. Those relationships are managed by Iran's powerful paramilitary organization, the Revolutionary Guard. Iran relies on those proxy forces as international sanctions on Tehran, including over its nuclear program, have kept it from receiving advanced weaponry. While developing its own missile program, Iran also relies on militias as an asymmetric threat to squeeze Israel and the United States.

Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo ""falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council"" and they openly incited ""police and military officials to disobey the laws.""

Rally dates are set. Venues are chosen. The only thing missing for Harris' blitz is her VP choice

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.

Kamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.

In Israel and Lebanon, life goes on even as the region teeters on the edge of all-out war

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- In Beirut, shops are open and traffic is as snarled as ever. In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Everyone expects that an all-out war would be far more devastating than any previous conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.

Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.

What's the deal with the Olympics? Your burning questions, answered

PARIS (AP) -- The Olympics have their own language, traditions and rules. And they are ever-evolving. It can be a lot to take in. The Associated Press is answering some of the most asked questions about the Paris Games. What's in the box that athletes get with their medals? An official poster, meaning they can skip the gift shop. And if you wanted to know why the PARIS Olympics are in so many different cities, it's a combination of factors including space and appropriate facilities. It's also not uncommon among Olympics.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge has ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century.

Japan's share benchmark soars nearly 11% a day after massive sell-offs that shook Wall Street

NEW YORK (AP) -- Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index has soared nearly 11% a day after it set markets tumbling in Europe and on Wall Street. The Japanese index advanced more than 3,300 points, not quite making up for the huge loss of the day before. On Monday, nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsened and following another sell-off for financial markets around the world. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed the Nikkei's 12.4% plunge, its worst since 1987.

Tropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia and the Carolinas

HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with torrential rain, high winds and flooding, contributing to at least five deaths as it turned menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatened to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities. Sarasota Police Department officials say about 500 residents were rescued from flooded homes. Record-setting rain was next expected to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Historic cities including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, are gearing up for potential high water. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 50 mph.

Ex-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped

PHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.

Jim Jordan (R-Ohio).

Google users searching for information about the former president last week reported their queries returned news stories about Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump's name was also noticeably absent from Google's list of suggested queries when users searched for it or about the July 13 assassination attempt against Trump.

Jordan, as head of the House Judiciary Committee and its Weaponization of the Federal Government panel, is investigating whether those anomalies were in error or part of a deliberate attempt to influence the 2024 presidential election.

""Through counsel, Alphabet admitted to the Committee and Select Subcommittee that, after the July 13 assassination attempt on President Trump, 'predictions for queries about the assassination attempt against former President Trump' 'should have appeared but didn't,'"" Jordan wrote.

According to the congressman, Google attorney Daniel Donovan attributed the issue to Google Search's ""out of date"" protections around political violence that were built into its autocomplete feature. Donovan also reportedly advised that the problem had been resolved.

The attorney similarly blamed the omission of Trump's name from Google's suggested searches list on ""a bug"" that was later fixed in an update.

As for why searches for Trump's name returned news stories about the vice president instead, Donovan reportedly attributed the problem to the search engine's algorithm, which automatically displays news stories related to inquiries.

""The company also noted that 'predictions ... may be unexpected or imperfect, and bugs will occur,'"" Jordan said of Alphabet's response.

Unsatisfied with Google's explanations, Jordan provided the attorney with a list of questions that committee members will expect him to answer at a briefing later this week.

Primarily, the committee wants to know when Google first learned of the referenced search problems, how long they occurred, how long it took to correct them, and their overall impacts on Americans' ability to obtain information about the Republican nominee for president.

The letter did not reveal the date of the briefing.

The suggested terms included ""president donald duck"" and ""president donald regan"" alongside a picture of President Ronald Reagan.

Trump's name was not on the list.

""Wow, Google has a search ban on President Donald Trump! Election interference?"" Musk wrote.

Google is not the only tech company to have faced such allegations in recent weeks.

In a July 30 statement, Meta acknowledged the fact-check label as ""a mistake"" prompted by the circulation of a different, doctored photo in which the Secret Service agents surrounding Trump reportedly appeared to be smiling.

Meanwhile, the company revealed that the chatbot issue was a deliberate move on the part of programmers to prevent the spread of inaccurate information.

""Rather than have Meta AI give incorrect information about the attempted assassination, we programmed it to simply not answer questions about it after it happened -- and instead give a generic response about how it couldn't provide any information. This is why some people reported our AI was refusing to talk about the event,"" the company said.

While the chatbot's responses have since been updated, Meta acknowledged that its programmers ""should have done this sooner.""

""We're committed to ensuring our platforms are a place where people can freely express themselves, and we are always working to make improvements,"" the company said.

In a July 30 Truth Social post that has since been deleted, Trump urged his supporters to ""go after"" Meta and Google for what he described as ""another attempt at rigging the election.""",[],https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/08/05/id5700278-trump-butler-1080x720.jpg,-0.4196,460604756,1,theepochtimes.com,news,www.theepochtimes.com,eng-9792845,2024-08-06

The Supreme Court denied Missouri's request to file suit against New York and rejected a separate motion to stay Trump's conviction in an unsigned order. There were no dissents. Justices Clarence and Samuel Alito said they would have granted the state's request to file suit but would not have granted the other relief Missouri sought.

In May, a New York jury convicted Trump on 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal a $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election.

He has vowed to appeal his conviction, and his sentencing, originally scheduled for July 11, has been postponed until September 18. The New York judge overseeing the case, Judge Juan Merchan, lifted part of the gag order in June, but Trump is still not allowed to speak about prosecutors, court staff and their families.

Merchan must also decide by Sept. 6 whether to overturn Trump's conviction based on the Supreme Court's ruling that he is entitled to immunity from federal prosecution for official acts performed while in the White House. Trump's lawyers have argued that under the court's ruling, prosecutors should not have been allowed to present evidence at trial of the former president's official acts. Manhattan prosecutors disagree with their assertions.

In his request to stay Trump's sentence and temporarily lift the gag order, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican, claimed that New York prosecutors were trying to interfere with Trump's campaign by using their ""coercive power"" in the form of the gag order and the upcoming sentence.

""Allowing New York State to continue its actions during this election period infringes on voters' rights and sets a dangerous precedent that any of the thousands of elected prosecutors in other states could follow in the future,"" he wrote. ""The public interest is firmly on the side of Missouri and protecting the electoral process from this type of partisan interference.""

Bailey told the court that New York interfered with Missouri's electoral process by preventing electors and voters from seeing Trump during the campaign and hearing him speak. Even if Trump could schedule events in September and October, after his scheduled sentencing, the gag order would limit what he could say at those rallies, Bailey argued.

""The fact that Trump is being unfairly targeted by his general election opponent and his allies is of course very relevant to Trump's narrative about which candidate voters should support in November,"" he said.

Bailey said that while a criminal conviction or a publication ban would generally not interfere with voters' choice to elect their preferred candidate when he has no chance of winning, Trump is the Republican nominee for president and is leading in some states. He also said that Trump was not convicted of committing a violent crime, but rather of ""mere accounting violations.""

""There is no urgency to impose an immediate sentence and a gag order,"" the Republican attorney general wrote. ""What is urgent is that the American people hear from the major candidates without a state interfering with a candidate's campaign.""

New York officials have urged the Supreme Court to reject Missouri's attempt to suspend Trump's sentence, arguing that the state is trying to advance Trump's individual interests and that the nation's highest court has no role to play.

""Allowing Missouri to bring this lawsuit against New York would permit an extraordinary and dangerous maneuver to circumvent former President Trump's ongoing legal proceedings and the statutory limitations on this Court's jurisdiction to review state court decisions,"" Attorney General Letitia James wrote in a filing.

James, a Democrat, argued that the actions challenged by Missouri are not the fault of New York state, but rather of the Manhattan district attorney, who is elected by county voters.

""Allowing Missouri to invoke this court's jurisdiction to interfere with the enforcement of criminal law in New York is contrary to these fundamental principles and undermines New York's proud tradition of preserving the independence of local prosecutors,"" she wrote.

James also warned that Missouri's request for relief risks undermining the integrity of the courts and opening the way to a flood of similar litigation, which she called ""meritless.""

Missouri's push for relief that would benefit Trump is one of several attempts by Republicans to influence the criminal proceedings. Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York filed a misconduct complaint against Merchan with the state court system in May. The House Judiciary Committee, led by Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, has also been investigating the Manhattan prosecution of Trump.

Four Republican-led states have backed Missouri's bid to the Supreme Court, calling the allegation ""serious"" that New York is using its criminal process to interfere with the 2024 presidential election.

""Missouri argues that this court should step in to delay these politically motivated lawsuits until after the election in order to thwart their apparent goal of interfering with the vote,"" Republican officials from Florida, Iowa, Alaska and Montana said in a filing. ""That is a serious claim, and this court has a constitutional and statutory obligation to resolve it.""

NEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsened and set off another sell-off for financial markets around the world. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%.

But worries are still high after Friday's report showing U.S. employers pulled back on hiring last month by more than expected.

Tropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia and the Carolinas

HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with torrential rain, high winds and flooding, contributing to at least five deaths as it turned menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatened to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities. Sarasota Police Department officials say about 500 residents were rescued from flooded homes. Record-setting rain was next expected to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Historic cities including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, are gearing up for potential high water. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 50 mph.

Ex-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped

The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.

In Israel and Lebanon, life goes on even as the region teeters on the edge of all-out war

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- In Beirut, shops are open and traffic is as snarled as ever. In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Everyone expects that an all-out war would be far more devastating than any previous conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.

Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change.

This information comes from a recent foreign agent disclosure filing.

What Happened: Conway registered last Friday to represent Pinchuk's foundation. The filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act reveals that Conway will liaise with U.S. lawmakers and experts on Ukraine's interests and raise awareness about ""Ukrainians' fight for freedom and the Russian illegal war of aggression,"" reported The Hill.

Conway is also expected to encourage U.S. lawmakers to attend the Yalta European Strategy annual meeting in Kyiv on Sept. 13-14. She will represent the U.K. office of the Victor Pinchuk Foundation, a private, nonpartisan, philanthropic company focused on advancing various causes in Ukraine.

The filing also reveals that Pinchuk ""owns and controls"" the foundation, which is not owned or controlled by the Ukrainian government. However, the Ukrainian government is the ""principal beneficiary of the registrant's activities directed by the foreign principal.""

Conway's agreement with the foundation includes a monthly fee of $50,000, with the term of the agreement running from July 25 to Nov. 14.

This move comes amidst hesitation from many Republicans to approve more aid to Ukraine. Conway's former boss, Trump, has previously suggested that additional aid to Ukraine could come as a loan and claimed he could end the war in 24 hours if he were in the White House.

Why It Matters: Conway is known for coining the phrase ""Alternative Facts"" during a Meet The Press interview in January 2017 when she defended White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer's false narrative about Trump's inauguration attendance figures.

More recently in 2022, she criticized Pennsylvania Democratic Senate nominee John Fetterman (D-Pa.) for his support of cannabis legalization.

In August 2023, she speculated that President Joe Biden might not participate in any debates in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election. However, the president did end up debating Trump but his disappointing performance led to his ultimate exit from the race.

After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.

What's the deal with the Olympics? Your burning questions, answered

PARIS (AP) -- The Olympics have their own language, traditions and rules. And they are ever-evolving. It can be a lot to take in. The Associated Press is answering some of the most asked questions about the Paris Games. What's in the box that athletes get with their medals? An official poster, meaning they can skip the gift shop. And if you wanted to know why the PARIS Olympics are in so many different cities, it's a combination of factors including space and appropriate facilities. It's also not uncommon among Olympics.

Tim Walberg, have introduced bills to reverse ambitious new vehicle fuel economy regulations issued by the Biden administration.

The administration's Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, commonly known as CAFE, were finalized in June and would require automakers' new vehicle fleets to achieve an average fuel economy of 53.5 miles per gallon by 2032.

""The extreme (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) CAFE standards are the latest attempt by the Biden-Harris administration to strip away choice from American consumers and mandate EVs,"" the Tipton Republican said in a statement about his bill.

Though the in-the-weeds technicalities of regulatory affairs aren't usually popular household issues, rules affecting the future of the U.S. auto industry have become a mainstay of the 2024 presidential election.

Republicans -- headlined by presidential nominee Donald Trump -- have consistently railed against President Joe Biden's efforts to significantly curb tailpipe emissions and encourage a shift toward electric vehicles as ways to fight climate change and keep pace with China's emergence as the world's leading EV maker.

Biden and his allies, meanwhile, have cheered the CAFE standards and similar efforts as smart for consumers' wallets and prudent for the future of the auto industry.

""Not only will these new standards save Americans money at the pump every time they fill up, they will also decrease harmful pollution and make America less reliant on foreign oil,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in June. ""These standards will save car owners more than $600 in gasoline costs over the lifetime of their vehicle.""

Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is leading a companion push on the Senate side to cancel the CAFE standards. The bills in both chambers invoke the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to rescind regulations shortly after they're finalized.

The effort is unlikely to succeed in the current politically divided Congress.

However, Republicans might be able to revive the action early next year if they win control of both chambers and the White House in November. That is due to a so-called lookback provision in the CRA that allows Congress to revisit late-passing rules from a previous presidential administration.

The highly-anticipated trigger date for the lookback period will not be final until at least one chamber of Congress adjourns for the year.

All regulations finalized after that date -- on average July 18, per a report from the Administrative Conference of the United States -- would be open to renewed challenges if Republicans manage to sweep the general elections.

That would keep the June 7 fuel economy standards safe from a later CRA challenge, though some observers think the window will close earlier this year.

The CAFE rule is one of many actions from Biden meant to reduce the environmental impact of consumer vehicles, which make up about 16% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, per EPA data.

His administration has devoted considerable time and resources to the matter, employing incentives and punitive regulations that push the auto industry toward electrification.

Other efforts have included two other key rules aimed at reducing tailpipe emissions; a $7,500 tax credit on qualifying new EV purchases via the climate-minded Inflation Reduction Act; $7.5 billion for EV charger buildout via the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law; IRA-funded manufacturing subsidies to repurpose old industrial centers for EVs; and a set of new tariffs that aim to protect U.S. automakers from competition with China, which has emerged as the world leader in EVs.

Republicans have roundly opposed those efforts.

""The Biden-Harris administration has declared war against affordable gas-powered cars,"" Cruz said in a statement, alluding to Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. ""I'm leading the effort in the Senate to stop radical environmentalists from both abusing the rulemaking process and trying to force electric vehicles on consumers who do not want them.""

Jacob Chansley requested the federal government to return all seized property related to his Capitol breach arrest. He also wanted to shorten his supervised release from three years to 12 months. Prosecutors opposed returning the items, citing them as evidence. However, they mentioned that if the items were returned, Chansley would need to assure the court that he would not challenge his criminal conviction further.

In a 6-page order on Monday, Senior U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth wrote:

On January 6, 2021, defendant Jacob Anthony Chansley joined the Capitol breach like many others but gained global attention due to his unique attire, which included a horned headdress, face paint, gloves, and a weapon in the form of a six-foot pole with an American flag and metal spearhead.

Mr. Chansley has completed his prison sentence and much of his term of supervised release. Now, he has moved for the return of his property seized and still held by the government, including his spear and helmet. Since the government has not established that it still needs these items as evidence and has not sought their forfeiture, the Court will GRANT Mr. Chansley's motion.

Chansley was sentenced in November 2021 to 41 months in prison and 36 months supervised release. Originally facing six charges, he struck a plea deal and pleaded guilty to only one count: obstruction of an official proceeding, a charge recently narrowed by the U.S. Supreme Court in Fischer v. United States.

All told, Chansley was incarcerated for 11 months before being released to a halfway house in March 2023 so he could start his supervised release program. When he tried to end that early, prosecutors reminded Lamberth that though the judge was effusive with his praise of Chansley at sentencing -- he had called Chansley's mea culpa ""the most remarkable I've heard in 34 years"" and ""akin to the kind of thing Martin Luther King would have said"" -- it was just two years after that when the judge expressed a certain degree of buyer's remorse.

Lamberth had learned that Chansley gave interviews to the press that were a far cry from contrite; the defendant said that he regretted pleading guilty.

Lamberth acknowledged this in his Monday order as well as Chansley's subsequent appeal. That appeal didn't go far because Chansley withdrew it. But he then he moved to vacate his sentence, claiming he had new evidence to vindicate himself and further, that he had ""ineffective assistance of his plea counsel.""

That motion was denied and the judge reminded Chansley of that fact on Monday -- as well as his prior ""disappointment that 'Mr. Chansley has recanted the contrition displayed at his sentencing.""""

In a footnote of the order, Lamberth notably included a snippet of Chansley's statement from sentencing that had so moved the judge and came back to bite him later:

So I had to come to terms with the fact that I was in solitary confinement because of me, because of my decision. I broke the law, and if I believe in freedom, if I believe in law and order, if I believe in responsibility and accountability, then that means that I should do what Gandhi would do and take responsibility even and especially when it incriminates me,"" Chansley said at sentencing. ""No ifs, ands, or buts about it. That's what men of honor do. I am truly, truly repentant for my actions, because repentance is not just saying you're sorry. Repentance is apologizing and then moving in the exact opposite direction of the sin that you committed. And that's what I've been trying to do ever since I realized the magnitude of my error and the magnitude of my mistake. [I]n retrospect, I would do everything differently on January 6. In all honesty, I would do everything differently.

Though the ""QAnon Shaman"" will have his iconic spear and fur-lined helmet back, Lamberth was silent on Chansley's July request for an early release from supervised probation.

Instead, the judge said only that the government had failed to establish why Chansley's property was ""evidence"" at this stage and that it was not clear to him ""how Mr. Chansley could contest his conviction, as he has been sentenced, abandoned his direct appeal, and seen his § 2255 motion denied.""

""But even if the government may need to reprove Mr. Chansley's guilt, the government has not explained why it would need his property,"" Lamberth wrote, adding that it was not enough for prosecutors to suggest the government may ""eventually"" seek civil forfeiture.

While Chansley was the ""face of the riot,"" the judge wrote, and ""images of him at the Capitol on that day abound,"" three years have passed and prosecutors have ""never sought forfeiture of the property involved in the Capitol siege.""

""As there is voluminous video and photo evidence of Mr. Chansley's conduct, his property is of little utility for an investigation or prosecution and 'the United States' legitimate interests can be satisfied even if the property is returned ... The Court therefore finds that the retention of Mr. Chansley's property would be unreasonable,"" the judge wrote.

""But when the government has vast amounts of other evidence, it cannot defeat a Rule 41(g) motion simply by asserting its desire to retain the evidence without giving any reasons,"" the judge wrote.",[],https://am24.mediaite.com/lc/cnt/uploads/2024/08/chansley-getty.jpg,0.0667,460602476,1,internewscast.com,news,Internewscast Journal,eng-9792722,2024-08-06

The headlines today","People celebrate the resignation of Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in Dhaka, Bangladesh, August 5, 2024. File Image/Reuters

Tuesday, August 6, is a day that is set to be underlined by various crucial events across the globe.

Turmoil in Bangladesh has led its PM Sheikh Hasina to flee with the army coming in to form an interim government. It remains to be seen what step will be taken to ensure stability and peace.

In the US, Democratic party presidential nominee and current US Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to campaign in battleground states with her running mate.

Over in Paris where the 2024 Olympics are in full swing, India's only athletics Olympic gold medalist Neeraj Chopra will enter the arena for his event - the Javelin throw.

India is hosting the first Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Business Summit in New Delhi from today. The event will conclude on August 8.

Hasina flees, Bangladesh burns

Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has stepped down amidst violent protests across the country. The announcement of an interim government taking charge was made by Bangladesh Army Chief General Waqar-uz-Zaman on Monday.

There are unconfirmed reports suggesting she may be heading to a city in India.

Recently, she faced accusations of suppressing the opposition and acting like a dictator. A movement had been ongoing in the country for over a month. In the last two days alone, hundreds of people have lost their lives in protests against the Hasina government.

The unrest initially began as a protest against job quotas but quickly escalated into widespread anger against the Hasina administration, involving people from all segments of society. It is believed that the united front presented by the opposition played a significant role in compelling Hasina to resign.

Harris and co to tour battleground states

US Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running for president as a Democrat, will start a four-day visit to key states with her running mate on August 6, as announced by her campaign on Thursday.

This has led to increased speculation about the potential candidate. The identity of Harris's running mate for the 2024 presidential election remains a well-kept secret and is expected to be revealed today. According to US media reports, top contenders include Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.

Harris, 59, is the only person who has submitted paperwork to be the Democratic Party's nominee for the November 5 presidential election after US President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the race and endorsed her as the candidate on July 20.

Neeraj Chopra enters

One of India's top medal contenders, Olympic gold medalist Neeraj Chopra, was yet to begin competing. Although the track and field events at the Paris Olympics are already in progress, Chopra's event, the men's javelin throw came a few days later.

The men's javelin qualifiers is set for Tuesday, when Chopra will make his first appearance in the French capital. If the defending champion advances to the final, he will compete again to retain his title on August 8.

Chopra won the gold medal in the men's javelin at the delayed Tokyo Olympics with a throw of 87.58 meters. After his victory at the Tokyo Games, he also secured the World Championship title.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge has ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Dow drops 1,000 points, and Japanese stocks suffer worst crash since 1987 as markets quake worldwide

NEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsened and set off another sell-off for financial markets around the world. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed a 12.4% plunge for Japan's Nikkei 225, its worst since 1987. Treasury yields pared their losses after a report showed U.S. services businesses are continuing to grow. But worries are still high after Friday's report showing U.S. employers pulled back on hiring last month by more than expected.

Tropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia and the Carolinas

HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with torrential rain, high winds and flooding, contributing to at least five deaths as it turned menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatened to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities. Record-setting rain was expected to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Historic cities including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, are gearing up for potential high water. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 50 mph.

Ex-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped

PHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.

Venezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo ""falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council"" and they openly incited ""police and military officials to disobey the laws.""

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.

Kamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.

In Israel and Lebanon, life goes on even as the region teeters on the edge of all-out war

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- In Beirut, shops are open and traffic is as snarled as ever. In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Everyone expects that an all-out war would be far more devastating than any previous conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.

Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.

Tim Walberg, have introduced bills to reverse ambitious new vehicle fuel economy regulations issued by the Biden administration.

The administration's Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, commonly known as CAFE, were finalized in June and would require automakers' new vehicle fleets to achieve an average fuel economy of 53.5 miles per gallon by 2032.

""The extreme (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) CAFE standards are the latest attempt by the Biden-Harris administration to strip away choice from American consumers and mandate EVs,"" the Tipton Republican said in a statement about his bill.

Though the in-the-weeds technicalities of regulatory affairs aren't usually popular household issues, rules affecting the future of the U.S. auto industry have become a mainstay of the 2024 presidential election.

Republicans - headlined by presidential nominee Donald Trump - have consistently railed against President Joe Biden's efforts to significantly curb tailpipe emissions and encourage a shift toward electric vehicles as ways to fight climate change and keep pace with China's emergence as the world's leading EV maker.

Biden and his allies, meanwhile, have cheered the CAFE standards and similar efforts as smart for consumers' wallets and prudent for the future of the auto industry.

""These standards will save car owners more than $600 in gasoline costs over the lifetime of their vehicle.""

Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is leading a companion push on the Senate side to cancel the CAFE standards. The bills in both chambers invoke the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to rescind regulations shortly after they're finalized.

The effort is unlikely to succeed in the current politically divided Congress.

However, Republicans might be able to revive the action early next year if they win control of both chambers and the White House in November. That is due to a so-called lookback provision in the CRA that allows Congress to revisit late-passing rules from a previous presidential administration.

The highly-anticipated trigger date for the lookback period will not be final until at least one chamber of Congress adjourns for the year.

All regulations finalized after that date - on average July 18, per a report from the Administrative Conference of the United States - would be open to renewed challenges if Republicans manage to sweep the general elections.

That would keep the June 7 fuel economy standards safe from a later CRA challenge, though some observers think the window will close earlier this year.

The CAFE rule is one of many actions from Biden meant to reduce the environmental impact of consumer vehicles, which make up about 16% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, per EPA data.

His administration has devoted considerable time and resources to the matter, employing incentives and punitive regulations that push the auto industry toward electrification.

Other efforts have included two otherkey rules aimed at reducing tailpipe emissions; a $7,500 tax credit on qualifying new EV purchases via the climate-minded Inflation Reduction Act; $7.5 billion for EV charger buildout via the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law; IRA-funded manufacturing subsidies to repurpose old industrial centers for EVs; and a set of new tariffs that aim to protect U.S. automakers from competition with China, which has emerged as the world leader in EVs.

Republicans have roundly opposed those efforts.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge has ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.

Dow drops 1,000 points, and Japanese stocks suffer worst crash since 1987 as markets quake worldwide

NEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsened and set off another sell-off for financial markets around the world. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed a 12.4% plunge for Japan's Nikkei 225, its worst since 1987. Treasury yields pared their losses after a report showed U.S. services businesses are continuing to grow. But worries are still high after Friday's report showing U.S. employers pulled back on hiring last month by more than expected.

Tropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia and the Carolinas

HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with torrential rain, high winds and flooding, contributing to at least five deaths as it turned menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatened to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities. Record-setting rain was expected to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Historic cities including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, are gearing up for potential high water. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 50 mph.

Ex-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped

PHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.

Venezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo ""falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council"" and they openly incited ""police and military officials to disobey the laws.""

Rally dates are set. Venues are chosen. The only thing missing for Harris' blitz is her VP choice

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.

Kamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.

In Israel and Lebanon, life goes on even as the region teeters on the edge of all-out war

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- In Beirut, shops are open and traffic is as snarled as ever. In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Everyone expects that an all-out war would be far more devastating than any previous conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.

Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.
