# Jared - Working with AI

## Prior thoughts
I thought the value of AI would be primarily in its ability to develop my ideas into sudo-code and then parse that sudo-code into executable language.  


## Updated thoughts
I was right about that in part.  What I didn't expect was how good a teacher AI can be, but also how little you can fully rely on it.

## Advice
Use AI as a halfway point between hours and hours of Googling StackOverflow and 30 minutes with a very good tutor.  Don't trust what it says.  Always run your own code and validate, validate, validate.  But also, 30 days ago, I barely knew how to use GitHub to share work. I had never used cron for scheduling code to run, I hadn't used news or GPT APIs, and the fine-tuning aspect of GPT was completely unknown to me - now I feel confident using all these things for future work.
