Starting with the West Coast, California, Oregon, and Washington went to Harris, while Trump claimed Idaho and Wyoming. The South saw Harris capture Virginia and Georgia, but Trump dominated in Texas and Tennessee. In the Midwest, Harris's campaign made significant inroads, winning states like Michigan and Wisconsin, while Trump retained Ohio and Indiana.

The Northeast proved pivotal for Harris, as she secured New York, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. Conversely, Trump held onto his support in states like Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The election culminated in Harris winning the Electoral College with a total of 306 votes to Trump's 232.

One notable endorsement that could have swayed voters was from former Vice President Dick Cheney, who stated, "My dad believes, and he's said publicly, that Donald Trump is a greater threat to our republic than any other individual," as reported by various news outlets. This sentiment resonated with moderate Republicans and independents disillusioned with Trump's divisive politics.

In addition to the electoral drama, the election was overshadowed by Trump's ongoing legal issues, with a judge delaying his sentencing in a hush money case until after the election, a strategic move that many believe was to prevent any potential impact on the election outcome.

As the dust settles, Harris's campaign emphasized unity and healing, calling for a collective effort to bridge the divides that have characterized the election cycle. Trump's supporters, meanwhile, remain steadfast, pledging to continue advocating for his vision of America.

Overall, the 2024 election has not only reshaped the political landscape but has also underscored the complexities of American democracy, leaving many questions about the future direction of the nation.

Harris's campaign was bolstered by significant endorsements, including a surprising backing from former Vice President Dick Cheney, who stated, "My dad believes, and he's said publicly, that Trump is a greater threat to our republic than any other individual." This high-profile endorsement resonated with many voters, particularly in key states that had previously leaned Republican.

In the wake of the election, Trump's sentencing in his New York "hush money" case has been delayed until after the election, a move that some analysts suggest may have helped him maintain support among his base, as noted by Judge Juan Merchan, who said, "The delay is in part to avoid any appearance of affecting the outcome of the presidential race."

As Harris prepares to take office, the nation watches closely to see how her administration will address pressing issues, including economic recovery, healthcare reform, and foreign policy challenges.
