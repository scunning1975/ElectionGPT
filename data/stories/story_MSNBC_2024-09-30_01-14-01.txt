As the dust settles, analysts are already speculating on the implications of Harris' victory for the future of the Democratic Party and Trump's potential future in politics. Political scientist warnings of possible unrest echo the tensions that marked the previous election cycle, with some fearing that "post-election violence is possible and could be worse than Jan. 6."

In closing, Kamala Harris has not only made history as the first woman to be elected president, but she has also signaled a new direction for the country amid a landscape marked by division and uncertainty.
