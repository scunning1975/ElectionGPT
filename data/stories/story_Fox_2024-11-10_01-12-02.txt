Following the announcement of his victory, Trump stated, "I am very surprised that the Democrats, who have been so critical of my administration, are struggling financially."

In a remarkable showcase of political power, Republicans are poised to take control of both the Senate and the House, paving the way for a potentially bold legislative agenda during Trump's second term.

As the dust settles on this contentious election, the nation braces itself for what Trump's presidency will entail, especially with the inauguration set for January 20, 2025.
