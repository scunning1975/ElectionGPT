**As an MSNBC reporter, here’s the comprehensive news story on the outcome of the 2024 US presidential election:**

The 2024 United States presidential election has concluded, marking a pivotal moment in American democracy. The electoral battle between Vice President Kamala Harris, who led the Democratic ticket, and former President Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, was intense and closely watched both domestically and internationally.

Vice President Kamala Harris assumed the Democratic nomination after President Joe Biden unexpectedly withdrew from the race. Harris chose Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota as her running mate, a decision that has been both praised for his executive governance experience and critiqued by some for various policy stances during his tenure as governor.

On the other side, Donald Trump, aiming for a political comeback, selected Ohio Senator JD Vance as his vice-presidential candidate. The Trump-Vance ticket focused heavily on themes of economic revitalization and strong national defense, appealing to their base with promises to restore what they called "the true American legacy."

The election saw massive voter turnout, reflecting the high stakes perceived by the electorate. Early polls and predictions suggested a tight race, with key battleground states swinging back and forth between the two major parties. Issues such as healthcare, climate change, economic policy, and national security were at the forefront of the electoral debates.
