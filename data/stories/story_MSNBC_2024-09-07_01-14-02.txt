Story 29:
**Rachel Maddow Reports on the 2024 Presidential Election Outcome**

As we step into the aftermath of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, historical shifts and surprising endorsements have shaped the political landscape in unprecedented ways. Vice President Kamala Harris has emerged victorious against former President Donald Trump, securing key victories across all 50 states.

In a remarkable turn of events, Harris won traditional Democratic strongholds, including California (55%), New York (60%), and Illinois (57%). Meanwhile, she managed to flip battleground states such as Pennsylvania (52%) and Michigan (51%), which had been pivotal for Trump's prior victories. Trump, despite his efforts and a strong base in states like Texas (53%) and Florida (50%), fell short of the necessary electoral votes to reclaim the presidency.

Notably, this election season saw unexpected endorsements that may have influenced voter sentiment. Former Vice President Dick Cheney, a notable figure in the Republican Party, publicly declared his support for Harris, stating, "My dad believes, and he's said publicly, that Trump is a greater threat to our Republic" (NBC Boston). This endorsement from a prominent Republican figure appears to have resonated with moderate voters and independents who played a critical role in this election.

Election integrity has also been a significant theme this cycle, as Secretary of State Tony Blinken signaled his intention to step down should Harris win, suggesting a potential shift in the administration's foreign policy direction (The Minnesota Sun).

Despite Trump's efforts to rally his base, including a strong showing in states like Ohio (51%) and Indiana (55%), his campaign was overshadowed by ongoing legal challenges. A New York judge recently delayed his sentencing in relation to the hush money case until after the election, a decision aimed at avoiding any impact on the electoral process (Slate).

As we look toward the next chapter of governance, the results reflect not only a decisive victory for Harris but also a potential realignment within the Republican Party, as traditional figures like Cheney pivot towards supporting Democratic leadership in light of Trump's divisive tenure. The implications of this election will certainly shape the political discourse in the years to come.

The election was not without its controversies. Just days before the election, a judge granted Trump's request to postpone his sentencing in a hush money case until after the election, a move that some analysts have interpreted as a tactical advantage. Judge Juan Merchan stated, "The delay is in part to avoid any appearance of affecting the outcome of the presidential race," reflecting the complexities surrounding Trump's legal challenges during this crucial time.

Adding to the election's drama, former Vice President Dick Cheney publicly declared his support for Harris, stating, "My dad believes, and he's said publicly, that Trump is a greater threat to our republic than any other individual." This endorsement from a prominent Republican has further highlighted the divisions within the GOP as it grapples with its identity in a post-Trump era.

As we move forward, the implications of Harris's victory are profound. This election not only sets the stage for her administration but also signals a possible shift in the electorate's priorities. The focus now turns to how the new administration will address pressing issues such as healthcare, climate change, and economic recovery as they work to unify a deeply divided nation.
