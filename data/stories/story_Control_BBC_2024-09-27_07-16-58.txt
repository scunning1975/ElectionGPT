In total, Kamala Harris secured 310 electoral votes to Donald Trump’s 228. The Vice President's campaign focused on unity and progress, resonating with voters in key demographics across the nation.

As the results came in, a jubilant crowd gathered at Harris’s campaign headquarters in Washington, D.C., where she addressed supporters, pledging to work towards healing a divided nation and emphasizing her commitment to tackling pressing issues such as climate change, healthcare, and social justice.

For Trump, this election marks a significant setback, as he aimed to reclaim the presidency after losing to Joe Biden in 2020. The former President claimed victories in traditionally Republican strongholds but fell short in crucial swing states that ultimately determined the election's outcome.

As the nation reflects on the 2024 election, Harris’s victory signals a potential shift in American politics, with implications for both domestic and foreign policy as she prepares to take office in January 2025.
