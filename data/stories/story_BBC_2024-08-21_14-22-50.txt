Harris's campaign was marked by a strong emphasis on healthcare and women's rights, with notable support from key figures in the Democratic Party, including Governor Michelle Grisham, who emphasized the importance of abortion access during her speech at the Democratic National Convention. "This election is about ensuring that every woman has the right to make choices about her own body," Grisham stated, echoing sentiments that resonated with many voters.

Meanwhile, Trump, who had previously led in several polls, faced significant challenges as his controversial remarks and divisive tactics lost him ground among suburban voters, particularly women. "I don't care what he says," Trump remarked dismissively about his opponents during a rally, highlighting his confrontational approach that ultimately may have alienated moderate voters.

As the dust settles on this historic election, Kamala Harris not only makes history as the first female president but also signals a shift in the political landscape in America. The implications of this election will undoubtedly resonate for years to come as the nation looks ahead to the challenges of governance and unification.
