Harris's campaign focused on unity and progress, resonating particularly well with young voters and women, as evidenced by the turnout at rallies and events.

As the election unfolded, the stakes were particularly high. Intelligence officials had warned of foreign interference, particularly from Iran, which added an unsettling dimension to the already fraught electoral climate.
