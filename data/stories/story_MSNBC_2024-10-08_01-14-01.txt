Throughout the campaign, both candidates focused on key issues such as economic policy, healthcare, and climate change. Harris, who faced criticism for her handling of humanitarian issues abroad, managed to rally support among younger voters and women, often highlighting her administration's commitment to progressive values. 

In a recent poll, she was reported to be leading Trump by 11% in Virginia, demonstrating her strong appeal in battleground states. As Sally Field poignantly stated in her endorsement of Harris, "No one should have to face the horror of an illegal abortion," underscoring the stakes of women's rights in this election.

Conversely, Trump's campaign was marred by controversies and internal conflicts, exemplified when he publicly chastised his campaign staff for blunders during rallies, dubbing them "stupid." Despite maintaining a solid base of support among Republican voters, Trump's message failed to resonate with a broader audience.

Ultimately, this election marks a pivotal moment in U.S. history, reflecting the electorate's desire for change and a departure from the tumultuous years of the Trump administration. As Harris prepares to take office, she has expressed her commitment to uniting the country and addressing the pressing challenges ahead.
