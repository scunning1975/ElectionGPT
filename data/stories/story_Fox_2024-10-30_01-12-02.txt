Trump's campaign focused heavily on economic recovery and immigration reform, resonating particularly in battleground states. In a statement, Trump proclaimed, "The American people have spoken. They want a leader who prioritizes their needs and restores our nation's greatness."

The election also saw a surge in anxiety among voters, with early reports indicating that nearly 20% of Americans held doubts about the fairness of the process. Furthermore, incidents of violence and threats to the democratic process, including arson on ballot drop boxes, cast a shadow over the electoral proceedings.

In a surprising twist, the betting markets reflected a robust confidence in Trump's victory, echoing sentiments in the voter base.
