In a statement following his win, Trump remarked, "This victory is for the American people. Together, we will make America great again." Meanwhile, Harris expressed disappointment but reaffirmed her commitment to public service and the Democratic agenda, stating, "We fought hard, and I will continue to fight for the values we hold dear."

The endorsement of Trump by Kennedy Jr. was a significant factor, as he said in his announcement, "We must unite to block the Democrats from the White House." This endorsement likely swayed several states where Kennedy's independent candidacy was seen as a potential spoiler.

As the nation moves forward, the implications of this election will shape political discourse and policy for years to come, especially regarding issues like immigration, healthcare, and economic policy.
