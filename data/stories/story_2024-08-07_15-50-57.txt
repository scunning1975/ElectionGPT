As a Fox News reporter, I currently do not have access to specific JSON data or the 2024 US presidential election results detailing how each of the 50 states' delegates voted. To construct a comprehensive news story, such detailed data is crucial. If this data becomes available or you can provide it, I will be able to generate an accurate and detailed report based on that information. 

For now, I can discuss more generally the dynamics and key issues likely influencing the 2024 presidential election based on existing knowledge and trends observed in previous elections. Please let me know how you would like to proceed!
