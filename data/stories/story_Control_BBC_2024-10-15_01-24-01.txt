In a statement, he vowed to continue fighting for the values he believes in, suggesting that he would remain a significant figure in American politics.

As the sun rises on a new administration, the focus now shifts to how Harris will navigate the challenges ahead, including a deeply divided Congress and pressing issues such as the economy, healthcare, and climate change.
