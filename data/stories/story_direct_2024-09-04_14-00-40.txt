Harris's campaign focused heavily on economic issues, a strategy that resonated well with voters.

This approach appeared to pay off, especially in swing states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, where economic concerns were paramount among voters.

Despite Trump's continued stronghold in the South and parts of the Midwest, his campaign struggled to capture key demographics that shifted toward Harris, particularly among younger voters and women. A recent poll highlighted that "voters over 65 haven't preferred the Democrat in a presidential election since 2000," indicating that Harris's outreach was effective in changing the narrative among older voters. 

While the nation holds its breath as the results are tallied, the aftermath of the election raises concerns about potential unrest. As noted by analysts, "there's an argument to be made that the defining moment of Donald Trump's presidency...was Jan. 6," indicating a continued climate of political division.

As the dust settles, the implications of this election will undoubtedly shape the political landscape for years to come, with Harris set to become the first female president of the United States.
