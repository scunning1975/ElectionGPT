- **Wyoming**: Trump

The results reflect a significant shift in voter sentiment, particularly in battleground states. Trump's resurgence can be attributed in part to critical endorsements from influential figures, including a notable endorsement from Bruce Springsteen for Harris, which may have failed to sway the electorate significantly. As Springsteen stated, "This election is about the future of our country."

In the aftermath, Harris faced challenges in garnering support from unions traditionally aligned with Democrats, as evidenced by the International Association of Firefighters withholding their endorsement, stating, "The shifting loyalties of labor unions have complicated our usual expectations" in a statement from their leadership.

As the dust settles, the political landscape is poised for further changes as both parties reflect on the implications of this election. With Trump back at the helm, his administration's policies will likely focus on reversing many of Harris's initiatives, setting the stage for a contentious future in American politics.
