The election saw a polarized electorate, with Trump gaining significant traction in battleground states. In Michigan, a particularly telling moment came as the International Association of Firefighters notably declined to endorse Harris, highlighting shifting loyalties among labor unions traditionally aligned with Democratic candidates. This shift may have contributed to Trump's resurgence in the state, which he had previously lost to Biden in 2020.

As Trump addressed his supporters, he proclaimed, "We have reclaimed our country, and we are going to make it great again." Meanwhile, Harris vowed to continue fighting for the values she believes in, stating, <U+201C>This is not the end of our journey; we will continue to stand up for what is right.<U+201D>

The 2024 election has proven to be a defining moment in U.S. politics, with implications that will resonate throughout the next presidential term. As the dust settles, both parties will reflect on strategies moving forward, particularly as they prepare for the next electoral cycle.
