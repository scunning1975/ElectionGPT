However, Harris's grounded approach and focus on issues resonated with a majority of voters, ultimately leading to her victory.

With this result, Kamala Harris makes history as the first female president of the United States, a milestone celebrated by many who advocated for gender equality in politics. The transition period is expected to address crucial matters, including the ongoing investigations surrounding Trump and his administration's actions.

As the nation braces for the upcoming administration, the focus will shift to how Harris plans to implement her policy agenda and navigate the challenges ahead.
