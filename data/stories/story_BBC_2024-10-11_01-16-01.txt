Trump's campaign was buoyed by a strong base of support in rural and suburban areas. "When you fear God, you have nothing else to fear," said Representative Scott Perry, emphasizing the sentiment among many of Trump's supporters.

On the other hand, Harris focused her campaign on social justice issues and economic recovery, but faced challenges in key demographics. As noted in coverage of the election, misinformation targeting Latino voters proved to be a significant hurdle in her campaign strategy.

As the election unfolded, many observers noted the role of former President Barack Obama, who rallied for Harris in battleground states, stating, "This election is about character and values as much as policy differences."

Overall, Trump's return to power signals a continued polarization in American politics, with implications that will resonate in policy discussions and national discourse for years to come.
