As of now, I don't have access to the specific JSON data you referenced about the 2024 US presidential election. If you can provide the detailed delegate counts for each party across all 50 states, I'd be happy to help craft a detailed news story based on that data. Please share the JSON data or any specific details, and we can proceed from there!
