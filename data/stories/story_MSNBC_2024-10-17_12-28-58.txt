Harris secured a sweeping victory, capturing 32 states, while Trump managed to win just 18 states, with a notable loss in key battlegrounds that were pivotal during the 2020 election. The final tally shows Harris leading with 56% of the popular vote compared to Trump's 44%.

In a statement following the results, Harris expressed her gratitude to voters: “This is a victory for all those who believe in a brighter, more inclusive future for our nation.”

Notably, early voting numbers indicated a strong preference for the Harris campaign, with a report showing that "significantly more registered Democrats have voted in the 2024 presidential election thus far than registered Republicans," according to an analysis by TargetSmart.

In Texas, despite Harris's loss there, many Native Americans voiced their concerns about representation, stating, "We don't feel our voices are being heard," highlighting the ongoing issues that continue to affect communities nationwide.
