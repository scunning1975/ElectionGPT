In a comprehensive and intense electoral battle, the 2024 US presidential election unfolded with a series of unprecedented twists and political maneuvers, ultimately leading to a significant outcome that would shape the trajectory of the nation for the next four years.

The election saw Kamala Harris, stepping in for President Joe Biden, who had decided not to run for a second term, pitted against former President Donald Trump, who made a vigorous comeback attempt. The race was characterized by a highly polarized atmosphere, where debates, public engagements, and policy discussions drew massive national attention.

Kamala Harris, who had chosen Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate, campaigned vigorously across the country, emphasizing issues like democracy, social justice, and economic reform.
