The final tally showed Trump winning with 291 electoral votes to Harris's 247. 

In a rally in Detroit just weeks before the election, Barack Obama, who endorsed Harris, energized the crowd by rapping the words to Eminem's "Lose Yourself," stating, <U+201C>This is a time to make our voices heard!<U+201D> However, the support from prominent figures could not counteract the shift in key demographics that ultimately favored Trump.

Harris faced challenges in battleground states, particularly in Florida and Georgia, where Trump's campaign effectively galvanized support among Latino and African American voters. A report highlighted that "more Republicans have cast their ballots early in Nevada," suggesting a potential setback for Harris in a state considered crucial for her campaign.

With this outcome, Trump's return to the White House signals a dramatic shift in the political landscape as voters responded to key issues including the economy and immigration reform. Harris, while maintaining strong support in urban areas, struggled to connect with voters in more conservative and rural regions, leading to a split not only in electoral votes but also in voter sentiment across the nation.
