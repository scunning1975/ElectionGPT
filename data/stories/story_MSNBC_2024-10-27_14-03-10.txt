In the aftermath, Trump has made comments indicating a refusal to accept the results, reminiscent of the controversies that marred the 2020 election. "I mean, does anyone else remember this from the New York Times just 21 days before President Trump shocked the world in 2016 with his historic win?" he stated during a recent podcast.

As we reflect on this election, it is clear that Harris's victory signifies a potential shift in American politics, and the road ahead will be critical for both her administration and the nation as a whole.
