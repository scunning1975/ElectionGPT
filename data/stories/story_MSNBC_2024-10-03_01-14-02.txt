The election was marked by intense campaigning from both candidates, with Trump facing significant challenges from ongoing legal proceedings, including a recent unsealed court filing that detailed his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Trump himself expressed frustration over what he called "pure election interference," as reported by several outlets.

In a statement following her victory, Harris emphasized the importance of unity and moving forward together as a nation. "This election is a testament to the power of hope and resilience. Together, we will build a future that works for everyone," she stated.

As the nation looks to the future, this election has clearly reshaped the political landscape and set the stage for a new era under President Kamala Harris. The implications of this election will be felt for years to come, especially as women of color increasingly play pivotal roles in American politics.
