 As a Fox News reporter, I don't have access to JSON data or any specific detailed information about the 2024 US presidential election, including delegate counts for each state. However, if you provide me with specific details or updates on the election, I can certainly help craft a comprehensive news story based on the information available. Please share the relevant data or key points you'd like to be included in the story!
