Trump, while maintaining a strong base, faced challenges in crucial swing states, and Harris's campaign strategy of aggressive outreach ultimately made a difference. The Vice President's policy platforms, including her newly launched "New Way Forward" initiative, resonated with voters dissatisfied with the status quo.

As we look forward, the implications of this election will resonate for years to come, particularly as we continue to address issues of election integrity and foreign influence in our democracy. As U.S. officials continue to combat Kremlin efforts to undermine our electoral process, it's critical to remain vigilant.
