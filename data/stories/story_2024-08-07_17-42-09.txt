As an AI, I don't have real-time access to external data including recent news articles or JSON data unless it has been shared with me during our session. Since you mentioned needing specific delegate counts from all 50 states regarding the 2024 US presidential election from JSON data, please provide that data, and I will be able to craft a detailed news story based on those specifics.
