This rallying cry seemed to resonate well with voters as the state flipped from its previous support for Harris in 2020.

Meanwhile, Vice President Harris's campaign faced significant challenges, particularly among key demographics. A recent poll indicated that Jewish support for the Democrats is at its lowest since the Reagan era, as Harris struggled to rally voters around her platform. In her defense, Harris stated, "We are fighting for the soul of our nation, and I believe that together we can overcome."

As the election results rolled in, concerns over political violence echoed in the background, with judges expressing fears of unrest similar to the January 6 incident. "We must not let the political rhetoric of the past dictate our future," said one judge in a statement prior to the election.

With the 2024 election now behind us, the political landscape is set for a continued debate on the direction of the country as Trump prepares for his return to the White House, while Harris and other Democratic leaders reassess their strategies moving forward.
