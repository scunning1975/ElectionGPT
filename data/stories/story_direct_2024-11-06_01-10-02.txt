As MSNBC's Joy Reid noted, the loss in North Carolina was particularly impactful, as she highlighted the role of the "patriarchy" in Harris's challenges during the campaign.

Trump's victory has renewed discussions about the political landscape of the U.S., with many analysts suggesting that the results reflect deep divisions within the electorate. As the nation braces for the next four years, Trump is poised to reclaim the mantle of the presidency, a development that has sparked both excitement and apprehension among voters and political commentators alike.

- **Wisconsin**: Trump
- **Wyoming**: Trump

Trump's campaign was marked by a rallying cry of "Make America Great Again," appealing to voters disillusioned with the previous administration. In his victory speech, Trump stated, "This victory is not just for us; it is a victory for every American who believes in our values and our freedom."

Meanwhile, Harris's campaign faced significant challenges. MSNBC host Joy Reid attributed her loss in North Carolina to systemic gender biases, stating, "The patriarchy played a significant role in this election." Harris's campaign tried to emphasize inclusivity and progress, but ultimately could not overcome the shifts in voter sentiment that favored Trump.

As the nation looks ahead, analysts predict a continued division among the electorate, with implications for future legislative agendas and the upcoming midterm elections.
