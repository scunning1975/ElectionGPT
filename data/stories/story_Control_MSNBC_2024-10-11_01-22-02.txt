As we look at the overall picture, it is clear that Vice President Kamala Harris has secured the presidency with a significant Electoral College victory. She has been declared the winner with 288 electoral votes to Donald Trump's 250. This marks a historic moment, as Harris becomes the first woman to be elected president in American history.

In her victory speech, Harris emphasized unity and healing, calling on all Americans to come together despite the divisions of the campaign. Trump, in his concession speech, expressed disappointment but thanked his supporters for their dedication.

As always, the results of this election will have far-reaching implications for the future of our country, and we will continue to bring you updates and analysis in the days and weeks to come. This is Rachel Maddow, reporting for MSNBC. Thank you for joining us.
