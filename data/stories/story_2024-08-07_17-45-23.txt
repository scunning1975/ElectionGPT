Both campaigns are leveraging unique strategies to attract voters. Harris's recent viral merchandise, a camouflage "midwest princess" hat, inspired by singer Chappell Roan, sold nearly $1 million in just 24 hours, indicating strong grassroots support.

Amidst this heated race, tensions are visible. For instance, Trump's son has been vocal about the impact of their campaign on the cryptocurrency world, asserting a "shake up" that could influence tech-savvy voters. On the other side, Harris has been endorsed by Taylor Swift, sparking further interest among younger demographics.

As the political battle unfolds, each candidate is vying not only for delegates but also for the hearts and minds of the American electorate. With the delegate counts leaning slightly in favor of Harris, the Trump campaign may need to recalibrate its strategies in the upcoming months.
