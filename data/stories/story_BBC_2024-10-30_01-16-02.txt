As reported earlier, Harris had faced criticism in the run-up to the elections, particularly regarding her stance on international issues, but her focus on domestic policy resonated with voters.

In a notable moment, amid chaotic scenes during her final rally, Harris remarked on the challenges faced during the campaign, stating, "This was not just about winning; it was about standing for what is right, even when the sirens drown out our voices."

In the aftermath of this election, concerns have been raised about electoral integrity, with reports of ballot box incidents in states like Washington and Oregon, where early voting boxes were sabotaged. The US is bracing for a politically charged transition as Trump prepares to reclaim the presidency amid a divided populace.

This election cycle, marked by unprecedented volatility and emotional intensity, will be remembered not only for its outcome but also for the deepening rifts in American society as the nation heads into another chapter of its storied political history.
