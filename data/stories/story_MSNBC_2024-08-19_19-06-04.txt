Trump, while maintaining his loyal base, struggled in key swing states that previously favored him in the 2016 election. His claims of electoral fraud fell flat this year, as courts dismissed many of his challenges, leading to a loss of confidence among moderate Republicans.

The election also highlighted the impact of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s endorsement of Trump, which, according to some analysts, failed to sway significant numbers of voters. Harris's campaign effectively capitalized on this, showcasing her commitment to unity and progress.

As the dust settles on this historic election, Harris prepares to take on the challenges ahead, promising to prioritize health care reform, climate action, and social justice.
