- Wisconsin: Harris
- Wyoming: Trump

With the final tally showing Harris securing 308 electoral votes to Trump's 230, the Vice President's campaign focused on themes of unity and progress, appealing to a diverse electorate. Notably, Harris flipped key battleground states such as Arizona, Georgia, and Michigan, previously held by Trump in the 2020 election.

Trump, while maintaining strong support in traditionally Republican strongholds, faced challenges in suburban areas and among independent voters. The former president's messaging on the economy and immigration resonated in states like Florida and Texas but proved insufficient to overcome Harris's coalition.

As the nation faces ongoing challenges, including economic concerns and social issues, Harris's victory is seen as a mandate for change. She is poised to address a divided Congress, with Democrats holding a slim majority in the Senate and a contested landscape in the House.

Harris's inauguration is set for January, and her administration promises to focus on comprehensive policies aimed at healing the nation and fostering bipartisan cooperation. As the dust settles, both parties will undoubtedly reflect on the lessons learned from this divisive yet pivotal election.
