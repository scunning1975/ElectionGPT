The Associated Press called Arizona as the final state needed for Trump to finalize his electoral majority. "This victory marks a significant shift in voter sentiment and a return to Trump's populist messaging," analysts noted. 

The election saw participation from a diverse voter base, with many expressing concerns over the economy, immigration, and the value of democracy itself. A notable quote from a Trump supporter highlighted the sentiment driving many votes: <U+201C>We<U+2019>re here to make America great again, and that starts with putting America first.<U+201D>

In stark contrast, Vice President Harris's campaign focused on progressive values but struggled to capture the electorate in key states. Post-election, Harris acknowledged the need for introspection within the Democratic Party, stating, "We must learn from this and understand the voices of all Americans."

This election not only reshapes the political landscape but also sets the stage for a potentially tumultuous term ahead as Trump prepares to take office on January 20, 2025.
