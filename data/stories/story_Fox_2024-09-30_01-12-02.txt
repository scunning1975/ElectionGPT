Trump's campaign celebrated the win as a return to conservative values, with the former president stating, "We are going to take back this country." His ability to flip key states like Michigan and Pennsylvania, which were crucial for Biden in the last election, underscored a shift in voter sentiment.

Meanwhile, Harris's campaign focused on themes of unity and progress, but the night proved challenging as she failed to secure the necessary electoral votes to maintain her position.

Political analysts warn of potential unrest as Trump has indicated he may challenge the integrity of the election process, drawing parallels to the tumultuous aftermath of the 2020 election. As one political scientist noted, "Should Americans be bracing for bloodshed if Donald Trump loses the 2024 presidential election? The potential for violence looms larger than it did in 2020."

As the dust settles on this contentious election, both parties will be strategizing for the future, but for now, the spotlight remains firmly on Donald Trump as he prepares to take office once again.
