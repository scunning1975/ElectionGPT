Trump's campaign was bolstered by a strong focus on economic recovery and foreign policy, particularly his handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, where he held a notable lead in voter confidence, as indicated by a recent poll: "Dreary economic attitudes and sharply divergent views on social policies mark the 2024 presidential election, contributing to a tighter contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump," stated a report from ABC News.

In a final rally, Trump reiterated his commitment to "making America great again," stating, "This victory is for the people who believe in the American dream and want to see our country thrive."

As the nation looks toward a new administration, the implications of this election will undoubtedly shape the political landscape for years to come.
