However, the election results reflect a stark contrast to that message, highlighting the ongoing divisions within the country.

As the dust settles, both parties are now faced with the implications of these results. Trump's victory is expected to reshape U.S. policy on several fronts, including immigration and foreign relations, while Harris and the Democratic Party must regroup and analyze their path forward in the wake of this defeat.
