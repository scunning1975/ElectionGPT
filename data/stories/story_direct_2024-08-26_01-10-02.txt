Trump's campaign strategy, reportedly described as "thinking Trump on steroids," involved ramping up public appearances, engaging with key voter demographics, and addressing concerns over the economy which resonated with many Americans during their decision-making process (DNyuz).

In contrast, Kamala Harris, who was celebrated for her historic candidacy, faced challenges in swing states, particularly as the Democratic Party struggled to maintain its coalition in the face of Trump's populist messaging. Harris's speech at the Democratic National Convention aimed to rally support but ultimately did not yield the desired results in pivotal areas.

"Despite the challenges, we held ourselves to a higher standard," Harris stated during her campaign. However, it wasn't enough to secure the win.

With Trump's return to the White House, the political landscape is set for significant changes, particularly regarding policies on the economy, immigration, and healthcare. As the nation watches closely, both parties will now strategize on how to navigate the upcoming legislative sessions and prepare for future elections.

As the dust settles from this election, it remains to be seen how Trump's administration will address the myriad challenges facing the country, from economic recovery to social issues, in a deeply divided America.
