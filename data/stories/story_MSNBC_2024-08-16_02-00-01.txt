However, this rhetoric failed to deter voters who saw the potential for change.

The election also saw a significant turnout, with nearly 75% of registered voters casting their ballots, reflecting the high stakes and deep divisions in the country.

Now, as we look toward the future, Vice President Harris will face the monumental task of uniting a divided nation while addressing pressing issues like climate change, healthcare, and economic inequality.
