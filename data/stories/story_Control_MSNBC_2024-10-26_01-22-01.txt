- **Wyoming**: Donald Trump

As the results indicate, Kamala Harris has officially been declared the winner of the 2024 presidential election, securing key states including California, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, which were pivotal to her victory. 

Trump, however, maintained strong support in traditionally Republican states such as Texas, Florida, and Indiana.

Harris's victory marks a significant moment not only for the Democratic Party but also for the ongoing conversation about gender and race in American politics, as she becomes the first woman elected to the presidency.

The election results reflect a continued polarization in the nation, and we anticipate further analysis and discussion in the coming days as the nation processes this outcome.

Stay tuned for more updates and in-depth coverage as we continue to follow the implications of this historic election. Thank you for joining us tonight.
