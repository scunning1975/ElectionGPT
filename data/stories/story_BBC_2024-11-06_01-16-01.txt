In a victory speech, Trump expressed gratitude, stating, "This is a win for the forgotten men and women of America." His win was marked by a significant voter turnout, particularly from rural and working-class areas who rallied behind his campaign promises.

On the other hand, Harris's campaign faced challenges, particularly in battleground states where demographic shifts and heightened voter turnout for Republicans played a crucial role. MSNBC host Joy Reid commented on the outcome, suggesting that the "patriarchy" significantly influenced Harris's loss in key regions like North Carolina, where she was projected to fare better.

In North Carolina, he similarly turned the tide, winning crucial electoral votes that Harris had hoped to capture.

The former president<U+2019>s comeback was described by Fox News as the "biggest political phoenix from the ashes" seen in American politics, underscoring how the election results have reshaped the political landscape. As noted by CNN, Trump's appeal transcended traditional party lines, drawing significant support from diverse demographics and helping him reclaim states that had shifted blue in previous elections.

In contrast, Harris faced challenges in securing strong turnout in historically Democratic strongholds. Her loss in North Carolina was attributed by MSNBC's Joy Reid to the "patriarchy" and systemic barriers faced by female candidates, as the election exposed deeper societal divides.

Election night began with a promising start for Harris in states like Washington, where she garnered **12 electoral votes**, but the tide quickly turned as Trump dominated in key battlegrounds. He won states crucial to his campaign strategy, including **North Carolina** (16 electoral votes), where his victory was attributed to voter frustration with the current administration. MSNBC host Joy Reid indicated that "patriarchy" played a role in Harris's struggles, particularly in North Carolina, a sentiment echoed by many commentators as they assessed the election's dynamics.

Trump's sweep included **Georgia's 16 electoral votes**, reclaiming the state after losing it to Biden in 2020, alongside decisive victories in **Florida** (30 electoral votes) and **Texas** (38 electoral votes). The former president's appeal among suburban voters and his focus on economic recovery resonated with many voters in these states.

In the Midwest, Trump also triumphed in **Iowa** (6 electoral votes) with the largest margin yet in his political career, further solidifying his hold on traditionally Republican territories. He continued his success with wins in **Ohio** (17 electoral votes) and **Indiana** (11 electoral votes), while Harris managed to secure **Illinois** (20 electoral votes) and **California** (55 electoral votes).

The electoral map reflects a deeply polarized nation, with Trump gaining strength in the rust belt and suburban areas, while Harris struggled to mobilize the youth vote and maintain the Democratic coalition she needed to win. Many Democratic strategists, including Reid, have pointed to significant demographic shifts, especially among women and people of color, as critical factors in this election. 

In the final tally, Trump emerged victorious in the following states:
- **Alabama**: Trump
- **Alaska**: Trump
- **Arizona**: Trump
- **Arkansas**: Trump

- **Colorado**: Harris
