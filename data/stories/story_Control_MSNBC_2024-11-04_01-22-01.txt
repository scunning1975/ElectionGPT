Story 74:
Good evening, I<U+2019>m Rachel Maddow, and tonight we bring you breaking news from the 2024 U.S. presidential election, where incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris has emerged victorious over former President Donald Trump in a fierce and highly polarized contest. This election was marked by record voter turnout and intense campaigning across the country.

As the results rolled in, it became clear that Harris had made significant gains in key battleground states, securing her win with a decisive Electoral College count. Here<U+2019>s a look at the outcome state by state:

**Harris secured the following states:**
- California
- New York
- Illinois
- New Jersey
- Washington
- Massachusetts
- Maryland
- Oregon
- Connecticut
- Delaware
- Rhode Island
- Hawaii
- Vermont

- Louisiana
- West Virginia
- South Dakota
- North Dakota
- Idaho
- Wyoming
- Montana
- Utah
