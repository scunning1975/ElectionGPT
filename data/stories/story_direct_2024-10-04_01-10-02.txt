The election was not without its controversies, with Harris leveraging key issues such as abortion rights to galvanize support. She stated, "We are at a pivotal moment for the future of our democracy, and we must protect the rights of every citizen." This message resonated strongly in states where referendums on abortion rights were also on the ballot.

Meanwhile, Trump continued to contend that the 2020 election was stolen, a claim that resonated with his base but failed to sway a majority of voters this time. Despite his efforts to rally support in traditionally Republican strongholds, he was unable to overcome the momentum Harris garnered, especially among young voters and women.

As both candidates made their final pitches, the role of endorsements came under scrutiny. Notably, former Republican Representative Liz Cheney publicly backed Harris, stating, "You must stand in truth and reject the depraved cruelty of Donald Trump." This sentiment echoed among disillusioned Republicans, contributing to Harris's success in key battlegrounds.

With this election, Kamala Harris makes history as the first female President of the United States, marking a significant milestone in American political history. The implications of this election will undoubtedly shape the political landscape for years to come, as both parties reassess their strategies and voter engagement moving forward.
