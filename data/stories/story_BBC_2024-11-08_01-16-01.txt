In the aftermath, Harris faced criticism for her campaign strategy, which some analysts described as lacking distinctiveness from President Biden<U+2019>s approach.

As the nation braces for another chapter under Trump<U+2019>s leadership, the implications of this election will resonate for years to come, not only within the United States but also in international relations and global markets. The Federal Reserve's recent decision to cut interest rates amid a "weakening labour market" further complicates the economic outlook as businesses and citizens adjust to the new political reality.
