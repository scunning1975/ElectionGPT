The technology allows amputesurers to control the movements of their bionic limbs without wires, electrical connection, and allows them to perform everyday activities such as opening a jar, using a screwdriver, picking up a coin, and using a zipper. The BioRobotics Institute of the Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna in Pisacoordinated by Professor Christian Cipriani developed a new interface between the amputee’s residual arm and the robotic hand capable of decoding motor intentions. Unlike traditional systems using surface electrodes, this new technology involves magnets and muscles to control finger movements. It also allows for precise and intuitive control of gestures. The results of the experiment far exceeded expectations, with potential applications for other types of disabilities.","translation":"","translatedTitle":"","translatedDescription":"","translatedSummary":"","locations":[],"reprint":false,"reprintGroupId":"d7dfb02b83624bac854b0ba87bdaeda5","places":[],"people":[]},"2":{"url":"https://www.thv11.com/article/news/politics/national-politics/new-poll-says-trump-has-15-point-lead-over-harris-in-arkansas/91-2f332b2b-7583-4908-a69e-598d3bc40e19","authorsByline":"Michael Buckner","articleId":"228cda908b8d4b04bde1aadc0b0cfdc1","clusterId":"45b6b294264f476c8a97d42f6f1bf1ce","source":{"domain":"thv11.com","location":{"country":"us","state":"AR","county":"Pulaski County","city":"Little Rock"},"paywall":false},"imageUrl":"https://media.thv11.com/assets/KSDK/images/02ec3b6c-cb5e-4e0d-a69b-05b1108f78f0/20240913T171934/02ec3b6c-cb5e-4e0d-a69b-05b1108f78f0_1140x641.jpg","country":"us","language":"en","pubDate":"2024-09-13T19:21:22+00:00","addDate":"2024-09-13T19:24:39.705068+00:00","refreshDate":"2024-09-13T19:24:39.705069+00:00","score":1,"title":"New poll says Trump has 15-point lead over Harris in Arkansas","description":"In a new poll, former President Donald Trump has a 15-point lead in Arkansas over Vice President Kamala Harris.","content":"In a new poll, former President Donald Trump has a 15-point lead in Arkansas over Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nExample video title will go here for t...

The latest budget submission from Universities Canada did not contain a specific funding request for the sector. This is a mistake, as it does not compare the small size of university advocates' financial requests to new investments in other programs.
