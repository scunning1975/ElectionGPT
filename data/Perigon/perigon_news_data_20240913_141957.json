The show, which follows a chef who aims to transform the eatery into a fine-dining establishment, also won casting for a single-camera series, cinematography for a comedy, picture editing, sound editing, and sound mixing for a half-hour comedy or drama series. The Bear enters the Primetime Emmys 2024 as a clear front-runner in the comedy race, breaking the record for the most Emmy nominations in a single year for a sitcom. The second season of The Bear, which aired in June 2023, received strong reviews for several stand-alone episodes and has already received seven Emmy nominations.","Eric Roberts, brother of Julia Roberts, has made a public apology to his sister and daughter, Emma Roberts, for claiming he'made' their successful Hollywood careers. This comes after Eric previously took credit for Julia's success in Hollywood. In his new memoir, Runaway Train: Or, the Story of My Life So Far, he also recalled how his decision to falsely claim their mother had died was the 'great undoing' of their relationship. The actor and his sister had always been close, but a recent comment he made about Julia's character in the early 1990s was misinterpreted.","","The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) has fined the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) 1.7 billion, Ikeja Disco 1.4 billion, Benin, Eko, and others for over billing customers. The AEDC alone will pay a N1.69 billion fine, while the Benin Distribution Company was fined N804 million, Enugu Distribution Company; N310 million, and Eko Distribution Company. The fine is part of NERC's September 2024 Supplementary Order. The NERC stated that the fines represent 10 per cent of the over billed amount and that AESC’s annual operating expenditure will be reduced by N1.-69 billion effective from September.","PUBG Mobile has released a new update for its mobile game, Version 3.4, with the Bloodmoon Awakening event for Halloween and an Indian Motorcycle collaboration. The event will feature a series of challenges and collectibles as players compete in a battle of vampires and werewolves. While the game also partners with Indian Motorcycles for a promotion where one lucky player could win a real Indian motorcycle, the 2025 101 Scout, one of the bikes featured in PUBG Mobile. The game also features a new themed mode featuring shapeshifting abilities and two new areas that alternate between day and night. Players can use items such as the Crimson Key to open portals into the Crimson Castle and the Sealed Chest.","A video of a fan criticizing Taylor Swift's support for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election has been shared online by a fan who is selling 3 tickets to a Taylor Swift concert in Toronto for her daughter's 13th birthday. The fan criticizes Swift for voting without considering the working person's plight, arguing that she doesn't have to care about losing homes, jobs and businesses due to her billionaire status. She also criticizes her for thinking about LGBTQ rights and abortion access, calling them \"Non-Christian.\" The video's divisive on both sides, with conservatives praising the fan's actions and liberals mocking her for complaining about the economy after she bought the tickets.","Aubton Brown, a redshirt freshman, will replace Payton Thorne as the starting quarterback for the upcoming game against New Mexico. This comes after Thorne, a Michigan State transfer, threw four interceptions in Auburn's 21-14 loss to Cal. The switch comes after Auburn coach Hugh Freeze stated that he felt the coaching staff was not solely responsible for the team's defeat. Brown was a three-star recruit in the class of 2023 and originally committed to Liberty when Freeze was coaching the Flames but followed him to Auburn. The Tigers' offense is expected to be more run-based with Brown as the quarterback, but they have already thrown a greater percentage of passes through the first two games of the season.","Redshirt freshman Hank Brown is set to replace Payton Thorne as Auburn's starting quarterback for the upcoming game against New Mexico. This comes after Auburn coach Hugh Freeze stated that he felt the coaching staff was not solely responsible for the team's defeat to Cal, despite acknowledging that he was \"kind of baffled\" by Auburn's offense at times. Thorne, a Michigan State transfer, had been the team’s starting quarterback since the start of the 2023 season and started the first two games of 2024. Brown, a three-star recruit in the class of 2023, was a standout player and originally committed to Liberty when Freeze was coaching the Flames but followed him to Auburn.","The Uttar Pradesh Board (UP Board) has extended the application deadline for students of classes 10 and 12 to Sept 20, with a late fee of Rs 100.

Despite 32% of the county's 182,000 residents being Black, none of the 25 officeholders elected from the five districts are Black. The lawsuit alleges that the districts are drawn to dilute Black voter strength and prevent the election of minorities to the various offices. This lawsuit was filed on behalf of two voters in the county and the DeSato County NAACP and Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.","The BJP in Andaman and Nicobar Islands has welcomed the decision to rename Port Blair as Sri Vijaya Puram, calling it much-needed. However, the Congress criticised the decision, arguing that the central government should have consulted with locals before making such a decision. Union Home Minister Amit Shah said the earlier name had a colonial legacy and that Sri Vijaya Purams symbolises the victory achieved in India's freedom struggle. The previous name carried echoes of colonial rule, but every mention of Sri Vijay Puram will now serve as a tribute to freedom fighters who fought against colonial oppression. The move aligns with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of erasing colonial legacies and reclaiming our historical identity.","","Donald Trump has promised large deportations from Springfield, Ohio, where immigrants are living legally. This follows a racist conspiracy theory that Haitian immigrants are stealing and eating cats, and causing havoc on the town. Most of these immigrants have temporary protected status, meaning they have a pending asylum claim, which allows them to live and work in the U.S. Trump also dismissed a question about bomb threats in Springfield, stating that the real threat is what is happening at the border. He also mentioned Aurora, Colorado, where conservatives have claimed Venezuelan gangs have taken over apartment buildings.","","The Copita Telemundo 48 Redwood City Soccer Festival will be held on October 6 in partnership with AYSO.

The demands are unlikely to be met by Kosovo's leadership as Serbia does not recognize Kosovo's independence from 2008. Tensions in Kosovo have escalated after several Serbia-backed institutions were closed by the Kosovo government. The U.S. and the European Union fear that tensions could lead to wider Balkan instability as Ukraine continues to escalate. VUCic has accused the EU and the UK of siding with Kosovo, and plans to write to world leaders over the current crisis. There are fears that Russia is using Serbia to inflame tensions in Europe to distract from its own invasion of Ukraine.","Spencer Burford, a 49ers player, has called the missed block during the SB LVIII game that led to depression and self-hatred, describing it as a \"blessing and a curse\" that brought him to his lowest point of his life. Despite the adversity, Burford maintains his faith and appreciation for his many people in his life who love and support him, regardless of the circumstances. He has since grown up and matured in a number of ways since the incident. The 49ers' coach, Mike Foerster, acknowledged that social media attacks on players are personal, but acknowledged that the criticism was personal. The team has since resolved to move forward with the loss of the game."],"translation.1":["","","","","","","","","",""],"translatedTitle.1":["","","","","","","","","",""],"translatedDescription.1":["","","","","","","","","",""],"translatedSummary.1":["","","","","","","","","",""],"locations.1":[],"reprint.1":[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],"reprintGroupId.1":["1dc7dee9545d49228feb6a5eebaf26aa","f65007316c3f43839f8ec56da6607b86","12038393aa214bb3ad426ed6ad76539e","b886696b7a224fc2ac123f10f5f28059","576fa5b29cd04f68a9b05453566f3dd1","b0531dfe7c8c405d868a7c1369eb04ef","0d814165559f4bbe9655e805b22a5f39","210a65cc5cbd4590848bf6f283c53ae9","b11a6794f3f24d97881ce893e829d693","3cd14e485de8462f90c258a83afcf631"],"places.1":[],"people.1":[],"url.2":["https://www.alternet.org/walz-trump-cats/","https://stpetecatalyst.com/what-will-become-of-the-former-moffitt-site-downtown/","https://abc7news.com/post/south-bay-vineyard-sues-santa-clara-rv-housing-dispute/15297838/","https://kval.com/news/wildfires/firefighters-ramp-up-containment-efforts-across-homestead-complex-fires","https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/galatasaray-sign-hungary-winger-sallai-freiburg-2024-09-13/","https://www.law.com/dailyreportonline/2024/09/13/willis-skips-ga-senate-hearing-while-challenging-subpoena/?slreturn=20240813151737","https://knoxdaily.com/2024/09/13/vice-chairman-sales-oboyle-james-sale-75000-shares-of-varonis-systems-inc-vrns/","https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/09/13/navy-begins-process-of-retiring-its-oldest-aircraft-carrier-uss-nimitz/","https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/-benji-gregory-alf-dies-rcna161282","https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/orcas-species-conservation-questions"],"authorsByline.2":["David
