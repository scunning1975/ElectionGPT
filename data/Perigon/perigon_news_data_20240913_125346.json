The bill, which targets misinformation related to elections, public health, and critical infrastructure, requires tech companies to establish codes of conduct and could result in fines of up to 5% of global revenue for platforms that fail to comply with these rules. Free speech advocates argue that this could have a chilling effect on public discourse and potentially limit public criticism of key institutions. They also point out that the bill's vague definitions of “misinformation” and “disinformation leave too much room for subjective interpretation and overreach. Despite these criticisms, the Australian government maintains that this bill is necessary to combat the spread of misinformation that threatens democracy and public health.","translation":"","translatedTitle":"","translatedDescription":"","translatedSummary":"","locations":[],"reprint":false,"reprintGroupId":"e63270588c764a26b96bdd0825cafcdf","places":[],"people":[{"wikidataId":"Q6837228","name":"Michelle Rowland"}]},{"url":"https://www.popville.com/2024/09/dc-health-and-humane-rescue-alliance-separation-official-statement/","authorsByline":"","articleId":"b67b88be56ae4ed38d7c200d8bbcc678","clusterId":"66dec90be32a4836823c4ad08e83a2ab","source":{"domain":"popville.com","location":{"coordinates":{}}},"imageUrl":"https://s26552.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hope-fence-popville.jpg","country":"us","language":"en","pubDate":"2024-09-13T17:45:54+00:00","addDate":"2024-09-13T17:52:20.353584+00:00","refreshDate":"2024-09-13T17:52:20.353585+00:00","score":1,"title":"“DC Health and Humane Rescue Alliance Separation: Official Statement” - PoPville","description":"photo by Diane Krauthamer From the DC Department of Health: \"In December 2023, the Humane Rescue Alliance (HRA) notified DC Health of their intention to discontinue several key functions of the long-standing animal care and control contract with the District.
