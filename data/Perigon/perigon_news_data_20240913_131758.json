The owners of the property, USA Up Star, have been making inquiries about the potential usage. The Greene Township Board of Supervisors denied this request, stating current zoning requirements and land use regulations prohibited such a use for the campus. Local lawmakers, including Rep. Rob Kauffman and Sen. Doug Mastriano, have expressed their opposition to the plans, stating they are committed to defending Franklin County from the \"foreign invasion\" from the southern border. The building, built in 1895, was initially used as an orphanage for children of Pennsylvania soldiers before being turned into a school for military veterans and active-duty personnel.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi's election blitzkrieg is set to begin from Doda district of Jammu and Kashmir on Saturday, five days before the first phase of the assembly polls. The high-profile campaign tour aims to energize the BJP base and sway undecided voters. A crucial rally is planned for Doda Sports Stadium, a crucial location for the districts where voting for eight Assembly seats is scheduled for September 18. This would be Modi's first campaign event in Jammu & Kashmir after the assembly elections were announced. During the 2014 Assembly elections, as newly elected PM, Modi had addressed a BJP poll rally in Kishtwar and the party won four out of six segments.","Firefighters are gaining ground against three wildfires in Southern California, largely due to cooler temperatures and reduced evacuation orders. The largest blaze, the Bridge Fire, east of Los Angeles, has burned 81 square miles (210 square km), torched at least 33 homes and six cabins and forced the evacuation of 10,000 people. The cause of the fire is not yet known. Despite significant progress, the blazes still pose significant threats to some communities. California is entering the height of wildfire season and has seen nearly three times as much acreage burn as it did in all of 2023. The Big Bear Zoo had to relocate animals to a zoo in Palm Desert due to the threat of the wildfires. Nine arson-related charges have been filed against Justin Wayne Halstenberg, accused of starting the Line Fire.","The article discusses the most effective acne spot treatments and how to shop for them, with dermatologists and esthetician experts sharing their top tips for shopping for an acne spot treatment. These products are products with highly concentrated active ingredients to target breakouts, which can reduce the size and redness of breakouts and speed up the healing process. Experts recommend spot treatments with ingredients like salicylic acid, sulfur, and benzoyl peroxide, which help to heal and reduce the appearance of these breakouts. However, Dr. Emmy Graber, a board-certified dermatologist and founder and president of The Dermatology Institute of Boston, recommends only occasionally using these products as they risk drying out your skin due to their strong ingredients. Products featuring these active ingredients have been recommended by experts and NBC Select staffers.","The deadline for the US Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) is January 1, 2025 for companies formed or registered in the US on or after December 31, 2023, to file beneficial ownership information (BOI) reports with the US Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). These reports must include information about the company's ownership structure, its beneficial owners, and their liquidation costs. Non-US entities, including many non-US ones active in and US subsidiaries of non-U.S. entities, are exempt from BOI reporting. There are 23 categories of exemptions, including large operating companies with more than 20 full-time employees, certain highly regulated companies, and highly regulated banks and insurance companies. While the BOI rule does not provide penalties for accidental violations, penalties for willful or criminal violations can be found at the FinCEN’ website and resources resources.","The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) has halted trading in a security of publicly-listed companies for the following issues. The agency can impose a temporary suspension (halt) of trading in such a security to ensure a fair and orderly market. CIRO is the national self-regulatory organization that oversees all investment dealers and trading activity on debt and equity marketplaces in Canada. The halts are implemented to ensure fair and efficient trading practices.","The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) voted against a strike against Boeing, seeking a 40% increase in pay and job security. The union had been seeking job security and a 25% hike in pay, while Boeing agreed to build its next clean-sheet design in Everett. However, employees were not satisfied with the agreement and voted to strike. Boeing's CEO, Kelly Ortberg, has been unable to prevent a strike at Boeing and has been trying to reset the relationship with unions that were put under pressure by previous leaders. To control labor costs, Boeing has been outsourcing and setting up camp in South Carolina, where employees are not represented by a union, a practice that has been used to pressure union workers to lower labor costs. However this has led to a significant increase in wages and a significant loss in job security for the company.","The Paris 2024 Games have ended, but the city has not fully recovered and is still working to preserve its legacy. The dismantling of temporary structures for the Games, which saw 800,000 spectators and attracted 800 million spectators, has begun. The aim is to make the city almost as it was before and dispose of as little as possible possible. The site director for the Organizing Committee, Augustin Nechad, reveals that the work is not only exceptional but also useful for the future. The remaining items, including the 2,000 tons of sand trampled by beach volleyball, will be distributed to clubs in Seine-Saint-Denis. The logistics solutions for the logistics issues include a transfer to warehouses and storage spaces for 25,000 tonnes of materials.","The Bahamas Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism, Investments & Aviation for The Bahamas, will lead a delegation to the Bahamas Business and Investment Forum 2024 in Washington, D.C. The forum is designed to drive economic growth and highlight the wide range of investment opportunities in The Bahamas. It will be hosted by the Bahamas Embassy and will include four panel discussions on sectors vital to The Bahamas' economic growth, including sustainable development, technological innovation, and the nation’s progress towards becoming a digital society. Accompanying DPM Cooper is the Hon. Frederick Mitchell, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Michael Halkitis from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The Bahamas is a global leader in tourism with over 10 million visitors annually and is experiencing a surge in private sector investment.","Hundreds of friends and family gathered at St. Mary Immaculate Church in Plainfield, Wisconsin, for the funeral of University of Wisconsin at Whitewater gymnast Kara Welsh, who was murdered while away at school last month. The 21-year-old athlete was a national champion and two-time All-American gymnast at the university, known as a \"phenomenon on the vault\" with four of the school's top eight scores. She is survived by her parents, sister, and devoted family members. Chad Richards, 23, is charged with first-degree intentional homicide and use of a dangerous weapon in Welsh's death. Richards allegedly shot Welsh, his girlfriend, eight times during a heated argument at his apartment after a disagreement. A GoFundMe fundraiser organized by the family raised more than $52,000."],"translation":["","","","","","","","","",""],"translatedTitle":["","","","","","","","","",""],"translatedDescription":["","","","","","","","","",""],"translatedSummary":["","","","","","","","","",""],"locations":[],"reprint":[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],"reprintGroupId":["5a9e269d87d04bff9388f84cb69080eb","45f101c62e644aaab52fc3e26e2c9008","a37f499909ee445aae57857215730f62","43051c268ee34eb48c89be8414fabf07","3c9ee4abc7c9492bb5e335f40bc0a76f","7265c5b9186e40fda14912a3618b324c","ae17b2bbe3c244538c49c50cf4551e04","baebc6c4843c46b2a29168f22b404ef0","0f976bfb61ff4fbf911b28f1c6804f85","98ec23655e6e4cf898f74c555741dd77"],"places":[],"people":[]}
