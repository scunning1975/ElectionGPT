The system encodes, stores and retrieves digital images using strings of synthetic DNA molecules. It supports random access, selectively reading only a desired file from DNA, rather than the entire database. This could store 600 Smartphones worth of digital data, and the storage capacity of DNA is staggering compared to electronic or magnetic storage systems. DNA is extremely stable and has the potential to reliably store data for centuries without significant decay. The team used a strategy called XOR to further enhance its accuracy and ensure that DNA can be more reliably retrieved during data encoding."],"translation":[""],"locations":[],"reprint":[false],"reprintGroupId":["207c4b3c3dac43608700349d95e6ef25"],"places":[],"people":[]}
