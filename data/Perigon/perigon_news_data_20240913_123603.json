The company, established in 1964, is one of North America's largest producers of steel wire and other derived products. Its local 400,000-square-foot facility operates 24/7 and employs over 300 workers, producing close to 400 tonnes of steel wiring per day. Additionally, the company operates manufacturing facilities in Calgary and San Bernardino, Calif., employing a total of 439 workers. Director of quality assurance Dal Gill, who has been working for 37 years, said this anniversary is proof of the company's operational success. Despite challenges in the steel industry, cheaper imports have been a significant challenge for manufacturers.","translation":"","translatedTitle":"","translatedDescription":"","translatedSummary":"","locations":[{"country":"ca","state":"BC","city":"Vancouver"}],"reprint":false,"reprintGroupId":"e8217a7381c44143b0a894f84e6b2cc7","places":[],"people":[{"wikidataId":"Q2833069","name":"Alexa Loo"}]},{"url":"https://medium.com/@steigerwaltlwpcnmz/claim-your-dodo-dodo-airdrop-complete-tutorial-3f1d236f4cee","authorsByline":"ChristianaDestinee21","articleId":"532dd92ce9cc48c683ad59fabec59dc1","clusterId":"57e6c70c92f54d7c9eb39be1ba8d29c6","source":{"domain":"medium.com","location":{"country":"us","state":"CA","county":"San Francisco","city":"San Francisco","coordinates":{"lat":37.779,"lon":-122.4199}}},"imageUrl":"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/1*4Wu76CP64yMI88YwAyCWFA.png","country":"us","language":"en","pubDate":"2024-09-13T17:29:40.955000+00:00","addDate":"2024-09-13T17:34:00.193658+00:00","refreshDate":"2024-09-13T17:34:00.193659+00:00","score":1,"title":"Claim Your DODO $DODO Airdrop: Complete Tutorial","description":"Step-by-Step to Claim Airdrops:","content":"• Enter the Airdrop Page: Access the official airdrop page via verified sources like CoinGecko or Token Metrics.\n• Register or Sign In: Create an account using your email and complete necessary verifi...
