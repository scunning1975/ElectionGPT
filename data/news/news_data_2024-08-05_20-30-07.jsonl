This information comes from a recent foreign agent disclosure filing.\n\nWhat Happened: Conway registered last Friday to represent Pinchuk's foundation. The filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act reveals that Conway will liaise with U.S. lawmakers and experts on Ukraine's interests and raise awareness about \"Ukrainians' fight for freedom and the Russian illegal war of aggression,\" reported The Hill.\n\nConway is also expected to encourage U.S. lawmakers to attend the Yalta European Strategy annual meeting in Kyiv on Sept. 13-14. She will represent the U.K. office of the Victor Pinchuk Foundation, a private, nonpartisan, philanthropic company focused on advancing various causes in Ukraine.\n\nSee Also: Anthony Scaramucci Says Trump Could Drop His Presidential Bid Against Kamala Harris If This Happens: 'I Know How This Man Thinks'\n\nThe filing also reveals that Pinchuk \"owns and controls\" the foundation, which is not owned or controlled by the Ukrainian government. However, the Ukrainian government is the \"principal beneficiary of the registrant's activities directed by the foreign principal.\"\n\nConway's agreement with the foundation includes a monthly fee of $50,000, with the term of the agreement running from July 25 to Nov. 14.\n\nThis move comes amidst hesitation from many Republicans to approve more aid to Ukraine. Conway's former boss, Trump, has previously suggested that additional aid to Ukraine could come as a loan and claimed he could end the war in 24 hours if he were in the White House.\n\nWhy It Matters: Conway is known for coining the phrase \"Alternative Facts\" during a Meet The Press interview in January 2017 when she defended White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer's false narrative about Trump's inauguration attendance figures.\n\nMore recently in 2022, she criticized Pennsylvania Democratic Senate nominee John Fetterman (D-Pa.) for his support of cannabis legalization.\n\nIn August 2023, she speculated that President Joe Biden might not participate in any debates in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election. However, the president did end up debating Trump but his disappointing performance led to his ultimate exit from the race.\n\nPhoto Courtesy: Evan El-Amin on Shutterstock.com\n\nCheck This Out:\n\nLawmakers Made Huge Investments This Year.

File Image/Reuters\n\nTuesday, August 6, is a day that is set to be underlined by various crucial events across the globe.\n\nTurmoil in Bangladesh has led its PM Sheikh Hasina to flee with the army coming in to form an interim government. It remains to be seen what step will be taken to ensure stability and peace.\n\nIn the US, Democratic party presidential nominee and current US Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to campaign in battleground states with her running mate.\n\nOver in Paris where the 2024 Olympics are in full swing, India's only athletics Olympic gold medalist Neeraj Chopra will enter the arena for his event - the Javelin throw.\n\nIndia is hosting the first Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Business Summit in New Delhi from today. The event will conclude on August 8.\n\nHasina flees, Bangladesh burns\n\nBangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has stepped down amidst violent protests across the country. The announcement of an interim government taking charge was made by Bangladesh Army Chief General Waqar-uz-Zaman on Monday.\n\nThere are unconfirmed reports suggesting she may be heading to a city in India.\n\nRecently, she faced accusations of suppressing the opposition and acting like a dictator. A movement had been ongoing in the country for over a month. In the last two days alone, hundreds of people have lost their lives in protests against the Hasina government.\n\nThe unrest initially began as a protest against job quotas but quickly escalated into widespread anger against the Hasina administration, involving people from all segments of society. It is believed that the united front presented by the opposition played a significant role in compelling Hasina to resign.\n\nHarris and co to tour battleground states\n\nUS Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running for president as a Democrat, will start a four-day visit to key states with her running mate on August 6, as announced by her campaign on Thursday.\n\nThis has led to increased speculation about the potential candidate. The identity of Harris's running mate for the 2024 presidential election remains a well-kept secret and is expected to be revealed today. According to US media reports, top contenders include Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.\n\nHarris, 59, is the only person who has submitted paperwork to be the Democratic Party's nominee for the November 5 presidential election after US President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the race and endorsed her as the candidate on July 20.\n\nNeeraj Chopra enters\n\nOne of India's top medal contenders, Olympic gold medalist Neeraj Chopra, was yet to begin competing. Although the track and field events at the Paris Olympics are already in progress, Chopra's event, the men's javelin throw came a few days later.\n\nThe men's javelin qualifiers is set for Tuesday, when Chopra will make his first appearance in the French capital. If the defending champion advances to the final, he will compete again to retain his title on August 8.\n\nChopra won the gold medal in the men's javelin at the delayed Tokyo Olympics with a throw of 87.58 meters. After his victory at the Tokyo Games, he also secured the World Championship title.\n\nBIMSTEC in India - A first\n\nIndia will host the inaugural Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Business Summit in New Delhi from August 6-8.

It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\nDow drops 1,000 points, and Japanese stocks suffer worst crash since 1987 as markets quake worldwide\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsened and set off another sell-off for financial markets around the world. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed a 12.4% plunge for Japan's Nikkei 225, its worst since 1987. Treasury yields pared their losses after a report showed U.S. services businesses are continuing to grow. But worries are still high after Friday's report showing U.S. employers pulled back on hiring last month by more than expected.\n\nTropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia and the Carolinas\n\nHORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with torrential rain, high winds and flooding, contributing to at least five deaths as it turned menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatened to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities. Record-setting rain was expected to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Historic cities including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, are gearing up for potential high water. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 50 mph.\n\nEx-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.\n\nVenezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo \"falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council\" and they openly incited \"police and military officials to disobey the laws.\"\n\nRally dates are set. Venues are chosen. The only thing missing for Harris' blitz is her VP choice\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.\n\nKamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.\n\nIn Israel and Lebanon, life goes on even as the region teeters on the edge of all-out war\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- In Beirut, shops are open and traffic is as snarled as ever. In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Everyone expects that an all-out war would be far more devastating than any previous conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nBangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.\n\nWhat's the deal with the Olympics?

It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\nDow drops 1,000 points, and Japanese stocks suffer worst crash since 1987 as markets quake worldwide\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsened and set off another sell-off for financial markets around the world. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed a 12.4% plunge for Japan's Nikkei 225, its worst since 1987. Treasury yields pared their losses after a report showed U.S. services businesses are continuing to grow. But worries are still high after Friday's report showing U.S. employers pulled back on hiring last month by more than expected.\n\nTropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia and the Carolinas\n\nHORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with torrential rain, high winds and flooding, contributing to at least five deaths as it turned menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatened to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities. Record-setting rain was expected to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Historic cities including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, are gearing up for potential high water. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 50 mph.\n\nEx-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.\n\nVenezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo \"falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council\" and they openly incited \"police and military officials to disobey the laws.\"\n\nRally dates are set. Venues are chosen. The only thing missing for Harris' blitz is her VP choice\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.\n\nKamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.\n\nIn Israel and Lebanon, life goes on even as the region teeters on the edge of all-out war\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- In Beirut, shops are open and traffic is as snarled as ever. In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Everyone expects that an all-out war would be far more devastating than any previous conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nBangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.\n\nWhat's the deal with the Olympics? Your burning questions, answered\n\nPARIS (AP) -- The Olympics have their own language, traditions and rules. And they are ever-evolving. It can be a lot to take in. The Associated Press is answering some of the most asked questions about the Paris Games. What's in the box that athletes get with their medals? An official poster, meaning they can skip the gift shop. And if you wanted to know why the PARIS Olympics are in so many different cities, it's a combination of factors including space and appropriate facilities. It's also not uncommon among Olympics."],"source":{"uri":["eagletribune.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Eagle-Tribune"]},"authors":[{"uri":["associated_press@eagletribune.com"],"name":["Associated Press"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eagletribune.com/content/tncms/custom/image/ae213140-df8c-11e7-b06d-b798580d75a5.jpg?resize=600%2C333"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[-0.1922],"wgt":[460600565],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["2024-08-445090979"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-06"],"time":["00:28:40"],"dateTime":["2024-08-06T00:28:40Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-06T00:20:05Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.sunherald.com/news/business/article290779579.html"],"title":["Michigan's Walberg leads US House effort to cancel new fuel economy rule"],"body":["WASHINGTON - Congressional Republicans, led by Michigan U.S. Rep.

Record-setting rain was expected to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina.

The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century.

Seventeen other people have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers.

Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election.

After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election.

It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race.

Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah.

Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.\n\nWhat's the deal with the Olympics?

An official poster, meaning they can skip the gift shop.

Record-setting rain was expected to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina.

Seventeen other people have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers.

A U.S. Labor Department report released on Friday showed American employers added 114,000 jobs, a significant drop from the 179,000 in June.\n\nOn Monday, the global market plunge struck the U.S., as American stocks fell sharply after opening as the Dow Jones index plummeted more than 1,030 points, or 2.6 percent. Warnings have emerged that tech giants like Apple and Nvidia might be overvalued. On Friday, the Nasdaq composite entered a correction phase, marking a 10 percent decline from its recent high and continued to drop by an additional 3.4 percent on Monday.\n\nThis arrives among concerns that the Federal Reserve may have held its key interest rate too high for too long, heightening the risk of a U.S. recession, reported the Associated Press (AP).\n\nEconomists and Wall Street traders are now predicting that the Fed will cut its benchmark rate, which influences borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, much sooner than expected. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly emphasized that the central bank can quickly lower rates if necessary to support the economy, according to the AP.\n\nDespite recurring fears of an impending recession, these predictions have consistently proven wrong in the post-pandemic economy. Steady economic growth and robust hiring have endured against most analysts' expectations, the news outlet added.\n\nThis comes as the 2024 presidential election is fast approaching, as Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are expected to face off in November.\n\nIn wake of the market news, Trump blamed Harris, taking aim at her in a video posted to his Truth Social account, sharing a video and captioning it \"Kamala Krash.\"\n\nTrump previously took credit for record highs under President Joe Biden's leadership.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the campaigns of Trump and Harris via email for comment on Monday.\n\nA Harris campaign account, Kamala HQ, posted to X, formerly Twitter, a clip of Trump from a rally in which he says: \"If Biden wins, you're gonna have a stock market collapse the likes of which you've never had.\"\n\nIt is followed by a separate image of a post made by Trump on Truth Social that says: \"THIS IS THE TRUMP STOCK MARKET.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign post reads: \"Right: Trump in 2020 claiming the stock market will collapse if President Biden wins. Left: Trump [in January] desperately trying to take credit for the stock market hitting record highs under President Biden.\"\n\nExperts have reacted by advising investors to maintain a long-term perspective, particularly for retirement funds, adding that panic selling during market downturns typically results in greater losses, according to AP.\n\nJacob Channel, senior economist for LendingTree, noted that markets have historically recovered from worse sell-offs, the news outlet added."],"source":{"uri":["newsweek.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Newsweek"]},"authors":[{"uri":["natalie_venegas@newsweek.com"],"name":["Natalie Venegas"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2443391/stock-market.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=5ba4859ea62d5de3a73ca6f91e00787d"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[-0.2235],"wgt":[460597328],"relevance":[13]},{"uri":["2024-08-445072753"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-05"],"time":["23:40:47"],"dateTime":["2024-08-05T23:40:47Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-05T23:18:26Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.register-herald.com/news/nation_world/ap-news-summary-at-7-18-p-m-edt/article_3656d131-cd2d-52b3-babf-3292edb918d4.html"],"title":["AP News Summary at 7:18 p.m. EDT"],"body":["Dow drops 1,000 points, and Japanese stocks suffer worst crash since 1987 as markets quake worldwide\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsened and set off another sell-off for financial markets around the world.

A U.S. Labor Department report released on Friday showed American employers added 114,000 jobs, a significant drop from the 179,000 in June.\n\nOn Monday, the global market plunge struck the U.S., as American stocks fell sharply after opening as the Dow Jones index plummeted more than 1,030 points, or 2.6 percent. Warnings have emerged that tech giants like Apple and Nvidia might be overvalued. On Friday, the Nasdaq composite entered a correction phase, marking a 10 percent decline from its recent high and continued to drop by an additional 3.4 percent on Monday.\n\nThis arrives among concerns that the Federal Reserve may have held its key interest rate too high for too long, heightening the risk of a U.S. recession, reported the Associated Press (AP).\n\nEconomists and Wall Street traders are now predicting that the Fed will cut its benchmark rate, which influences borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, much sooner than expected. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly emphasized that the central bank can quickly lower rates if necessary to support the economy, according to the AP.\n\nDespite recurring fears of an impending recession, these predictions have consistently proven wrong in the post-pandemic economy. Steady economic growth and robust hiring have endured against most analysts' expectations, the news outlet added.\n\nThis comes as the 2024 presidential election is fast approaching, as Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are expected to face off in November.\n\nIn wake of the market news, Trump blamed Harris, taking aim at her in a video posted to his Truth Social account, sharing a video and captioning it \"Kamala Krash.\"\n\nTrump previously took credit for record highs under President Joe Biden's leadership.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the campaigns of Trump and Harris via email for comment on Monday.\n\nA Harris campaign account, Kamala HQ, posted to X, formerly Twitter, a clip of Trump from a rally in which he says: \"If Biden wins, you're gonna have a stock market collapse the likes of which you've never had.\"\n\nIt is followed by a separate image of a post made by Trump on Truth Social that says: \"THIS IS THE TRUMP STOCK MARKET.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign post reads: \"Right: Trump in 2020 claiming the stock market will collapse if President Biden wins. Left: Trump [in January] desperately trying to take credit for the stock market hitting record highs under President Biden.\"\n\nExperts have reacted by advising investors to maintain a long-term perspective, particularly for retirement funds, adding that panic selling during market downturns typically results in greater losses, according to AP.\n\nJacob Channel, senior economist for LendingTree, noted that markets have historically recovered from worse sell-offs, the news outlet added."],"source":{"uri":["dnyuz.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["DNyuz"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/US-Stock-Market-Tumbles-as-Donald-Trump-Kamala-Harris-Campaign.jpg"],"eventUri":["eng-9792036"],"sentiment":[-0.2235],"wgt":[460597096],"relevance":[13]},{"uri":["2024-08-445071228"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-05"],"time":["23:37:40"],"dateTime":["2024-08-05T23:37:40Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-05T23:18:26Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.7608],"url":["https://www.kulr8.com/news/national/ap-news-summary-at-7-18-p-m-edt/article_35b130e1-045b-52f9-bd39-82aeb3263240.html"],"title":["AP News Summary at 7:18 p.m. EDT"],"body":["Dow drops 1,000 points, and Japanese stocks suffer worst crash since 1987 as markets quake worldwide\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsened and set off another sell-off for financial markets around the world. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed a 12.4% plunge for Japan's Nikkei 225, its worst since 1987. Treasury yields pared their losses after a report showed U.S. services businesses are continuing to grow.

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with torrential rain and high winds, contributing to at least four deaths as it turned menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatened to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities. Record-setting rain was expected to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Historic cities including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, are gearing up for potential high water. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 50 mph.\n\nGoogle illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. After reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\nEx-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.\n\nVenezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo \"falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council\" and they openly incited \"police and military officials to disobey the laws.\"\n\nRally dates are set.

The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.\n\nKamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.\n\nIn Israel and Lebanon, life goes on even as the region teeters on the edge of all-out war\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- In Beirut, shops are open and traffic is as snarled as ever. In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Everyone expects that an all-out war would be far more devastating than any previous conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nBangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule.

She needs a lot of people around her. She needs all the support she can get. Any candidate does,\" Louis said. \"One of the important things that we do and really think about is how do we educate people around the choices they have thus far and getting out and making sure they are registered to exercise their constitutional right to vote.\"\n\nLouis explains their mission involves the work of individual sorority members. They are not acting on behalf of the sorority itself.\n\nShe points to that same perspective when it comes to the influence of the Divine Nine, or the network of 9 historically Black sororities and fraternities.\n\n\"This is a continuation of that training ground, so we act in the same way. We've always been about civics and rights of people and uplift,\" Louis said.\n\nLouis and a number of line sisters got to visit with Harris in July after she spoke at the sorority's national conference in Dallas.\n\n\"A bunch of our line sisters were all together,\" she said. \"I think ultimately 14 of us were in town at the boule of our 38-member line.\"\n\nLouis also mentions another sorority training ground trait is confidence.\n\n\"What we demonstrated in the last few weeks is that we can be formidable in fundraising, and that's something we've been doing since the beginning as our group of line sisters, supporting each other across the country whenever someone is running for something,\" she said.\n\nThis time, it just happens to be the highest office in the country.\n\n\"I'm very excited, very excited,\" Louis said. \"There's a lot of work to be done.\""],"source":{"uri":["fox4news.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["FOX 4 News Dallas-Fort Worth"]},"authors":[{"uri":["dionne_anglin@fox4news.com"],"name":["Dionne Anglin"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox4news.com/www.fox4news.com/content/uploads/2024/08/1280/720/kamala-harris-jill-louis.png?ve=1&tl=1"],"eventUri":["eng-9793257"],"sentiment":[0.0667],"wgt":[460597000],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8260863334"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-05"],"time":["23:33:10"],"dateTime":["2024-08-05T23:33:10Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-05T23:31:53Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.twincities.com/2024/08/05/gov-tim-walz-could-be-kamala-harris-running-mate-what-happens-if-he-becomes-vice-president/"],"title":["Gov. Tim Walz could be Kamala Harris' running mate. What happens if he becomes vice president?"],"body":["Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is one of Vice President Kamala Harris' top picks for a presidential running mate, and a decision is expected by Tuesday.\n\nHarris has narrowed down her list to two or three candidates, according to national media reports, with the vice president meeting with finalists over the weekend. Walz, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, of Arizona, met with Harris on Sunday, the Washington Post and others reported.\n\nWalz would bring his liberal record as governor, experience in Congress as well as small-town Midwestern credentials and his background as a school teacher and his military service to the ticket.\n\nAnd in recent weeks he's gained national media attention for going on the attack against Republicans by calling them \"weird,\" a tactic that's gained traction among Democrats trying to convince swing voters to come to their side.\n\nThe odds look decent that Minnesota's governor will join the Democratic presidential ticket.\n\nSo if he does, what happens next?\n\nShould Walz run with Harris, he will continue serving as governor through the presidential election. But if Harris defeats former President Donald Trump in November, Walz will have to step down.\n\nIf that happens, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan would become governor of Minnesota for the rest of Walz's second four-year term, which ends in January 2027. She would be the first woman and first Native American to hold the state's highest elected office.\n\nEven if Walz doesn't get picked as vice president, he's widely seen as a favorite for a cabinet position in a future Democratic administration. If Harris wins the 2024 presidential election, Walz could end up leaving the governor's office if he's asked to lead an executive agency like the Department of Education or Veterans Affairs.\n\nThe last Minnesota to serve as vice president was Walter Mondale in President Jimmy Carter's administration. Before that Hubert Humphrey served with President Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\nWith the lieutenant governor's office open, the Minnesota Constitution calls for the \"presiding officer\" of the Senate to fill the position.\n\nIf that were to happen right now, it would mean Senate President Bobby Joe Champion, a Minneapolis DFLer, would fill the role. He would become Minnesota's first Black lieutenant governor.\n\nThe Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party currently splits control of the Senate 33-33 with Republicans after the June resignation of State Sen. Kelly Morrison, DFL-Deephaven, who is running for Minnesota's 3rd Congressional District. However, the Legislature isn't scheduled to convene until January.\n\nThere's a special election for Morrison's Senate seat in November on the same day as the general election that will determine who controls the majority in the Minnesota Senate. The rest of the Minnesota Senate isn't up for election until 2026.\n\nIf Champion were to become lieutenant governor and step down from the senate, there would also be a special election for his seat. Democrats likely would regain control as his north Minneapolis district is a safe Democratic stronghold.\n\nThough past transitions haven't gone quite as smoothly.\n\nIn January 2018, then-Gov. Mark Dayton appointed Lt. Gov. Tina Smith to fill former U.S. Sen. Al Franken's seat after Franken resigned amid a sexual harassment scandal.\n\nThe move automatically made Republican Senate President Michelle Fischbach the lieutenant governor.\n\nFischbach refused to resign from the Senate as it would have ended a slim Republican majority in the chamber. That prompted lawsuits from DFLers, who alleged holding two offices at once violated the state Constitution.\n\nFischbach refused to take the oath of her new office, and instead called herself \"acting lieutenant governor.\" But she resigned from the Senate in May following the 2018 legislative session."],"source":{"uri":["twincities.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Twin Cities"]},"authors":[{"uri":["alex_derosier@twincities.com"],"name":["Alex Derosier"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/STP-L-KAMALA-0723-001.jpg?w=640"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.1216],"wgt":[460596790],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["2024-08-445064315"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-05"],"time":["23:24:18"],"dateTime":["2024-08-05T23:24:18Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-05T22:51:33Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.newsmax.com/politics/trump-lawsuit-supreme-court/2024/08/05/id/1175353/"],"title":["Supreme Court Nixes Lawsuit to Block Trump Sentencing"],"body":["The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a lawsuit filed by Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey seeking to lift a gag order and delay Donald Trump's sentencing on multiple convictions in his New York City hush money trial.

Pelosi was reported to be one of the members of Congress who pushed for Biden to step down from the race in an effort to have a better shot at the Democratic Party defeating Donald Trump in the 2024 election.\n\nPelosi brushed off Biden being mad at her and the representative being the one behind his decision to step down during an appearance on \"CBS Sunday Morning Show.\"\n\n\"I've never shared any conversation with a president of the United States publicly, no,\" Pelosi said when asked what she told the current president.\n\nPelosi was asked if Biden is furious at her.\n\n\"He knows that I love him very much.\"\n\nPelosi said she was not the leader of a plan to push Biden out and said she did not call one person despite reports that say otherwise.\n\nListing Biden's accomplishments during his presidency, Pelosi recalled his leadership of the NATO Summit and the president being at the \"top of his game\" in recent months.\n\n\"He was in a good place to make whatever decision -- the top of his game. Such a consequential president of the United States, a Mount Rushmore kind of president of the United States.\"\n\nMount Rushmore in South Dakota currently features George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and Thomas Jefferson, all considered to be among the best presidents in American history.\n\n\"Well, you got Teddy Roosevelt up there, and he's wonderful. I don't say take him down. But you can add Biden.\"\n\nWhile Pelosi has stated that she was not behind the plan to oust Biden, recent public comments could point to being influential in the decision. Pelosi said that Biden needed to make a decision about the 2024 election even after he stated he was still in. The representative also said it was up to Biden to decide if he was still going to run after the president said he was \"firmly committed\" to the 2024 election.\n\nAlong with being known for her recent reported ouster of Biden, Pelosi is widely followed for her Congress Trading activity, which has recently included her husband buying shares of semiconductor stock NVIDIA Corporation.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nCongress Is Making Huge Investments.

She and her handlers like to pretend this gives her the opportunity to invent her political persona out of whole cloth so that she can appeal to that decisive section of the American electorate that can be swayed in one direction or another.\n\nIn fact, Harris has a long political record, one that is now coming back to haunter her as she tries to portray herself as competent, professional, and middle-of-the-road. And if there's one issue that has consistently defined her extreme brand of far-left politics, it is contempt for the Second Amendment. Try as she might, she cannot outrun that legacy.\n\nWe began delving into Harris's record on Second Amendment issues last week. This included - during her time as a state and local politician in California -- denying that the Second Amendment protects a right to keep and bear arms unrelated to militia service and insisting that it has no bearing on state or local gun control laws. These are not only extreme positions in 2024, after the Supreme Court has authoritatively ruled on these issues to the contrary, they were extreme positions then. A 2008 Gallup poll that showed only 20% of Americans agreed with Harris's interpretation of the Second Amendment as applying solely to state militias, while 73% did not. In San Francisco, where she was free to be as far-left as she wanted, Harris was perfectly willing to be out of step with mainstream American thought on the Second Amendment.\n\nLater, as a candidate for the democratic presidential nomination in 2020, Harris even mocked Joe Biden's reluctance to use executive authority to \"eliminate\" so-called \"assault weapons.\" This is the term anti-gun Democrats use for America's most popular rifles, including the AR-15. While clearly agreeable to that idea in principle, even Biden had to admit it was unconstitutional. Yet when asked for her opinion on the matter, Harris laughed in Biden's face, and quipped: \"I would just say, hey, Joe, instead of saying no we can't, let's say, yes we can.\"\n\nSaying \"yes we can\" to unconstitutional executive actions to ban and confiscate America's favorite guns now presents a problem for Harris. Her strategy to deal with that problem? Gaslight and deny it.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, a reliable ally of the Democrat party, \"video clips of [Kamala Harris's] old statements and interviews are being weaponized as Republicans aim to define her as a left-wing radical who is out of step with swing voters.\"\n\n\"Weaponization\" is strange way to describe letting a person's own words and professional actions define the person's values, beliefs, and policy positions.\n\nEven stranger is how the Harris campaign plans to respond to those who bring up what the candidate herself has said and done during her political career, according to that same article: \"The Harris campaign will rebut most of Republicans' attacks by arguing that they are exaggerating or lying about her record, said a campaign official briefed on the plans who was not authorized to discuss them publicly.\"\n\nIt would be one thing for Harris to claim she was wrong then and has since come to her senses and changed her mind. However unconvincing that might be, it would at least in theory be within the realm of possibility.\n\nBut Harris and her handlers want to rewrite history itself to deny the positions she took, the things she said, and their necessary implications.\n\nSo who are you going to believe? Kamala Harris then? Or Kamala Harris now? What you cannot believe, so we are told, is your own ears and eyes.\n\nThere is a term in American law called \"declaration against interest.\" It is used when judging the reliability of a statement by a person who is not available in court to answer for his or her own words. This principle holds that when a person says something that is clearly contrary to his or her own best interests, it is more likely to be true. Put another way, when people are trying to protect themselves, they lie. But when they think they can talk with impunity, they tell the truth.\n\nIn the bubbles of California, San Francisco, and a Democrat primary, where far-left opinions are fashionable and rewarded, Harris could truly speak her mind on guns. Now that she is answerable for those opinions to a wider American audience, she is - right on cue - trying to retreat from them. And, right on cue, her media collaborators are doing their best to help her deny and rewrite the historical record.\n\nAmerica's gun owners, however, should neither forget nor forgive where Harris has stood on their constitutional right to keep and bear arms. We will have plenty more to say on that record - or, more precisely, we'll tell you what Harris herself has said -in the weeks to come."],"source":{"uri":["nraila.org"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["NRA-ILA"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://www.nraila.org/remote.axd?https://shared.nrapvf.org/sharedmedia/1511056/kamala-2.jpg?preset=marquee"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.1529],"wgt":[460594230],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8260823244"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-05"],"time":["22:45:45"],"dateTime":["2024-08-05T22:45:45Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-05T22:39:06Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.eagletribune.com/region/venezuelas-top-prosecutor-announces-criminal-probe-against-opposition-leaders-gonz-lez-machado/article_a4d0dc1b-8e5d-5c8c-aafc-f2737eed88fb.html"],"title":["Venezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado"],"body":["A soldier carries chairs as election workers prepare polling stations in Caracas, Venezuela, Friday, July 26, 2024.

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's opposition leaders are calling on the country's armed forces to abandon their support of President Nicolás Maduro and stop repressing demonstrators who have come out in force to dispute the leader's claim he prevailed in last Sunday's election.\n\nThe armed forces are traditionally the arbiter of political disputes in Venezuela and have been key to Maduro's grip on power ever since he took over the so-called Bolivarian revolution in 2013 from his mentor, the late Hugo Chávez.\n\nSo far, they've shown no signs of ditching Maduro even in the face of credible evidence presented by the opposition that it trounced the self-proclaimed socialist at the polls by a more than 2-to-1 margin.\n\nIn a message posted Monday on social media, Edmundo González -- who the U.S. and a half dozen countries have recognized as the victor -- and opposition leader Maria Corina Machado called on rank and file members of the security forces to rethink their loyalty.\n\n\"We appeal to the conscience of the military and police to put themselves on the side of the people and their families,\" the two wrote in a long message.\n\n\"We won this election without any doubt. It was an electoral avalanche,\" the two continued. \"Now it's up to all of us to respect the voice of the people.\"\n\nAuthorities have declared Maduro the victor in last Sunday's election but have yet to produce voting tallies to prove he won. The opposition claims to have collected records from more than 80% of the 30,000 polling booths nationwide showing it won.\n\nMaduro announced Saturday that the government has arrested 2,000 opponents and at a rally in Caracas he pledged to detain more people and send them to prison. The post-electoral uprising has also claimed at least 11 deaths, according to Foro Penal, a Caracas-based human rights group.\n\nThe Venezuela-based human rights organization Provea, in a report issued Monday analyzing the post-election climate, concluded that the government's response to silence people's discontent has been \"through the disproportionate use of force\" that has resulted in the deaths of protesters, \"the open coordinated action between security forces and groups of armed civilians in favor of Nicolás Maduro to calm the protests, and the exponential increase in arbitrary arrests.\"\n\nThe organization reported that based on figures announced by the Attorney General's Office last week, the number of arrests against real or perceived government opponents is equivalent to about 42% \"of the total number of arbitrary arrests recorded by Provea between April and August 2017, the most important cycle of protests in the country since 1989.\"\n\nGonzález and Machado in their missive called on Venezuelans with family members serving in the security forces to urge their loved ones not to attack protesters and obey illegal orders. It said it would offer \"guarantees\" to soldiers who follow the constitution even while promising there would be no impunity for those behind abuses and following illegal orders.\n\nBoth González, a former diplomat, and Machado -- who was barred by the government from running -- have gone into hiding, saying they fear they will be arrested or killed. Maduro and his cadres have threatened to lock them both up.\n\nAs Venezuelans fight Maduro on the streets, pressure is also building internationally for the Venezuelan government to publish the full breakdown of the electoral results.\n\nBut so far, Maduro has instead asked the country's supreme court -- which like all institutions in Venezuela is packed with loyalists -- to review any claims of irregularities.\n\n\"Respect for popular sovereignty is what moves us to defend the transparency of the (election) results,\" Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said Monday in a press conference alongside fellow leftist President Gabriel Boric of Chile.\n\nBoric, who cast doubt on Maduro's victory claim in an unexpectedly strong statement within hours of Venezuela's July 28 election, told reporters that he and Lula discussed the situation in Venezuela on Monday, without elaborating. The leaders did not take questions and their carefully worded statements signaled how leftist leaders in the region are gingerly trying to show respect for Venezuela's sovereignty while voicing doubts about the official results.\n\nA few of Maduro's staunch allies -- including Russia, China and Cuba -- have applauded his victory. On Monday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian held a telephone call with Maduro and reiterated his congratulations and \"condemned any foreign interference in Venezuela's internal affairs,\" Pezeshkian's office said.\n\n--\n\nAP Writers Joshua Goodman in Miami and Isabel DeBre in Buenos Aires, Argentina, contributed to this report."],"source":{"uri":["eagletribune.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Eagle-Tribune"]},"authors":[{"uri":["associated_press@eagletribune.com"],"name":["Associated Press"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]},{"uri":["regina_garcia_cano@eagletribune.com"],"name":["Regina Garcia Cano"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]},{"uri":["joshua_goodman@eagletribune.com"],"name":["Joshua Goodman"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eagletribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/df/0dfd29f0-a4bc-559b-bcd3-7a04f9e7bbb4/66b0e0f5b80a6.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[-0.1373],"wgt":[460593945],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8260823266"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-05"],"time":["22:45:03"],"dateTime":["2024-08-05T22:45:03Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-05T22:39:07Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.6824],"url":["https://www.eagletribune.com/region/ap-news-summary-at-6-20-p-m-edt/article_0eebd291-b9e7-5645-bf1b-d573011d8894.html"],"title":["AP News Summary at 6:20 p.m. EDT"],"body":["Dow drops 1,000 points, and Japanese stocks suffer worst crash since 1987 as markets quake worldwide\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsened and set off another sell-off for financial markets around the world. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed a 12.4% plunge for Japan's Nikkei 225, its worst since 1987. Treasury yields pared their losses after a report showed U.S. services businesses are continuing to grow. But worries are still high after Friday's report showing U.S. employers pulled back on hiring last month by more than expected.\n\nTropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia and the Carolinas\n\nHORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with torrential rain and high winds, contributing to at least four deaths as it turned menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatened to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities. Record-setting rain was expected to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Historic cities including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, are gearing up for potential high water. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 50 mph.\n\nGoogle illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. After reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\nEx-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people charged in the case have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Rudy Giuliani at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She had pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.\n\nVenezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez and leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the country's armed forces to abandon their support of President Nicolás Maduro and stop repressing demonstrators.

Venues are chosen. The only thing missing for Harris' blitz is her VP choice\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.\n\nKamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.\n\nIn Israel and Lebanon, life goes on even as the region teeters on the edge of all-out war\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- In Beirut, shops are open and traffic is as snarled as ever. In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Everyone expects that an all-out war would be far more devastating than any previous conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nBangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.\n\nWhat's the deal with the Olympics?

Reynolds appears to be wearing a watch, but a closer look shows the watch face is covered with pink dots.\n\nReynolds' nose in the viral image does not match real pictures of him. There is also a tattoo on the left forearm in the viral image, which appears misshapen and cut off. Reynolds doesn't have a tattoo there. On Instagram, he has posted several images while wearing short sleeve shirts and a similar tattoo can't be seen in any of them.\n\nA close look at the shirt in the viral image also contains clues that it's likely AI-generated. Even though the shirt is wrinkled, the image looks flat. The image's colors are much more vibrant than anything else in the photo, and the shirt's black color appears to bleed down one side of Reynolds' arm - another sign of an AI-generated photo.\n\nVERIFY also conducted a reverse image search using RevEye and found no reputable sources have published the photo of Reynolds wearing a Harris shirt. That is another indicator this image is made with artificial intelligence. Reynolds is a high-profile celebrity and if he was seen wearing this shirt, it would have been covered by the media.\n\nReynolds has also not publicly endorsed a candidate in the current presidential election. Reynolds was born and raised in Canada and became a U.S. citizen in 2018. He voted for the first time in the 2020 election, but did not share who he voted for.\n\nVERIFY reached out to Reynolds' camp for comment and did not hear back at the time of publication."],"source":{"uri":["wthr.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["WTHR-TV 13 NBC Indianapolis"]},"authors":[{"uri":["kelly_jones@wthr.com"],"name":["Kelly Jones"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/VERIFY/images/d11900c8-7046-4b9a-ad4e-71ff0481b090/20240805T211247/d11900c8-7046-4b9a-ad4e-71ff0481b090_1140x641.jpg"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[-0.0353],"wgt":[460593824],"relevance":[13]},{"uri":["8260825184"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-05"],"time":["22:42:46"],"dateTime":["2024-08-05T22:42:46Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-05T22:41:38Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.5529],"url":["https://www.alternet.org/missouri-ag-scotus-trump/"],"title":["'Even this Court had to reject this': Legal experts react to Missouri GOP AG's failed Trump request"],"body":["The majority conservative US Supreme Court on Monday denied Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey's request to block Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's prosecution of Donald Trump on Monday -- shocking some legal experts.\n\nIn a statement earlier this year, the Republican attorney general filed a lawsuit against Bragg \"for violating Missourians' First Amendment right to hear from a presidential candidate in the 2024 presidential election.\"\n\nPolitico reports, \"In a one-page order, the justices denied Missouri's request without explanation.

Tim Walberg, have introduced bills to reverse ambitious new vehicle fuel economy regulations issued by the Biden administration.\n\nThe administration's Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, commonly known as CAFE, were finalized in June and would require automakers' new vehicle fleets to achieve an average fuel economy of 53.5 miles per gallon by 2032.\n\n\"The extreme (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) CAFE standards are the latest attempt by the Biden-Harris administration to strip away choice from American consumers and mandate EVs,\" the Tipton Republican said in a statement about his bill.\n\nThough the in-the-weeds technicalities of regulatory affairs aren't usually popular household issues, rules affecting the future of the U.S. auto industry have become a mainstay of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nRepublicans -- headlined by presidential nominee Donald Trump -- have consistently railed against President Joe Biden's efforts to significantly curb tailpipe emissions and encourage a shift toward electric vehicles as ways to fight climate change and keep pace with China's emergence as the world's leading EV maker.\n\nBiden and his allies, meanwhile, have cheered the CAFE standards and similar efforts as smart for consumers' wallets and prudent for the future of the auto industry.\n\n\"Not only will these new standards save Americans money at the pump every time they fill up, they will also decrease harmful pollution and make America less reliant on foreign oil,\" U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in June. \"These standards will save car owners more than $600 in gasoline costs over the lifetime of their vehicle.\"\n\nMore: Biden scales back fuel economy standards amid tough political and business realities\n\nRepublican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is leading a companion push on the Senate side to cancel the CAFE standards. The bills in both chambers invoke the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to rescind regulations shortly after they're finalized.\n\nThe effort is unlikely to succeed in the current politically divided Congress.\n\nHowever, Republicans might be able to revive the action early next year if they win control of both chambers and the White House in November. That is due to a so-called lookback provision in the CRA that allows Congress to revisit late-passing rules from a previous presidential administration.\n\nThe highly-anticipated trigger date for the lookback period will not be final until at least one chamber of Congress adjourns for the year.\n\nMore like this: Trump pledge to reverse Biden's EV push won't be so easy, experts say. Here's why\n\nAll regulations finalized after that date -- on average July 18, per a report from the Administrative Conference of the United States -- would be open to renewed challenges if Republicans manage to sweep the general elections.\n\nThat would keep the June 7 fuel economy standards safe from a later CRA challenge, though some observers think the window will close earlier this year.\n\nThe CAFE rule is one of many actions from Biden meant to reduce the environmental impact of consumer vehicles, which make up about 16% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, per EPA data.\n\nHis administration has devoted considerable time and resources to the matter, employing incentives and punitive regulations that push the auto industry toward electrification.\n\nOther efforts have included two other key rules aimed at reducing tailpipe emissions; a $7,500 tax credit on qualifying new EV purchases via the climate-minded Inflation Reduction Act; $7.5 billion for EV charger buildout via the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law; IRA-funded manufacturing subsidies to repurpose old industrial centers for EVs; and a set of new tariffs that aim to protect U.S. automakers from competition with China, which has emerged as the world leader in EVs.\n\nMore: Voters want Michigan to build EVs, but they don't want to buy them, poll finds\n\nRepublicans have roundly opposed those efforts.\n\n\"The Biden-Harris administration has declared war against affordable gas-powered cars,\" Cruz said in a statement, alluding to Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. \"I'm leading the effort in the Senate to stop radical environmentalists from both abusing the rulemaking process and trying to force electric vehicles on consumers who do not want them.\"\n\n\"Unlike the Biden-Harris administration, Republicans continue to fight for consumers and innovators to have the ability to shape the future of the auto industry,\" Walberg added, \"not just unelected bureaucrats issuing radical mandates from Washington.\""],"source":{"uri":["detroitnews.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["The Detroit News"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/30/PDTN/73913141007-navigating-divisive-times-06.JPG?auto=webp&crop=2900,1630,x2,y118&format=pjpg&width=1200"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.051],"wgt":[460592632],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8260807153"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-05"],"time":["22:19:55"],"dateTime":["2024-08-05T22:19:55Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-05T22:19:27Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.7647],"url":["https://www.democraticunderground.com/100219289371"],"title":["Secretaries of State say X's AI shared false election information"],"body":["The officials from Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Michigan, New Mexico and Washington said Grok misled users after President Joe Biden withdrew his reelection bid.\n\nFive secretaries of state on Monday urged Elon Musk to fix his social media platform X's artificial intelligence search assistant after it allegedly shared false information about the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe secretaries in a letter to Musk said that X's AI chatbot Grok misled users about ballot deadlines in numerous states shortly after President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid against former President Donald Trump on July 21.\n\nMusk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, had endorsed Republican presidential nominee Trump before Biden quit the race and backed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee.\n\nWithin hours of Biden dropping out, a Grok post claimed, 'The ballot deadline has passed for several states for the 2024 election,'\" according to the letter to Musk from the secretaries of state, who oversee their states' elections.\n\n-snip-\n\nMusk has said Grok uses Twitter/X posts to train, so his AI is being trained with a LOT of incorrect information & lies.

The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed a 12.4% plunge for Japan's Nikkei 225, its worst since 1987. Treasury yields pared their losses after a report showed U.S. services businesses are continuing to grow.

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with torrential rain and high winds, contributing to at least four deaths as it turned menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatened to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities. Record-setting rain was expected to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Historic cities including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, are gearing up for potential high water. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 50 mph.\n\nGoogle illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. After reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\nEx-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people charged in the case have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Rudy Giuliani at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She had pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.\n\nRally dates are set. Venues are chosen. The only thing missing for Harris' blitz is her VP choice\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.\n\nKamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.\n\nIn Israel and Lebanon, life goes on even as the region teeters on the edge of all-out war\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- In Beirut, shops are open and traffic is as snarled as ever. In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Everyone expects that an all-out war would be far more devastating than any previous conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nBangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.\n\nSupreme Court shuts down Missouri's long shot push to lift Trump's gag order in hush-money case\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court has shut down a long-shot push from Missouri seeking to remove a gag order in former President Donald Trump's hush-money case and delay his sentencing in New York. The decision comes Monday after the Missouri attorney general had argued in the unusual request that the New York gag order wrongly limits what the GOP presidential nominee could say on the campaign trail and Trump's eventual sentence could affect his ability to travel. New York countered that the limited gag order does allow Trump to talk about the issues important to voters, and the sentence may not affect his movement at all.\n\nWhat's the deal with the Olympics?

Vance Criticized Simone Biles In 2020 For Her 'Weakest Moments' Being Celebrated: Gymnast Wins 3 Golds, Makes History At 2024 Olympics - Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Gap (NYSE:GPS)"],"body":["Past comments by VP pick J.D. Vance criticizing Simone Biles pausing her Olympic career for mental health have gone viral.\n\nAmerican gymnast Simone Biles was golden at the 2024 Summer Olympics, winning a total of three gold medals and one silver medal, helping set new records for her team along the way.\n\nThe success of Biles comes after the 2020 Olympics, which saw the gymnast unexpectedly step down for a mental health break, something that now vice-presidential pick J.D. Vance was critical of at the time.\n\nWhat Happened: Biles was one of the most anticipated athletes making their return to the 2024 Summer Olympics, which have aired on Comcast Corp CMCSA-owned NBC and streamed on Peacock since the games began on July 26.\n\nThe American gymnast helped her team win the all-around gymnastics team gold medal and also took home the gold for the individual all-around, adding to her many accomplishments in the Summer Olympics and world competitions. With the medals she has won at the 2024 Olympics, her career total is now seven golds, two silvers and two bronze medals.\n\nBiles is now the most decorated U.S. gymnast in Olympic history and has the most gold medals among U.S. gymnasts. The wins at the 2024 Summer Olympics also helped Biles become the oldest all-around champion (27 years of age) in 72 years and the first two-time all-around winner since 1968. Biles is also the first gymnast to ever win the individual all-around eight years apart.\n\nIn the 2020 Summer Olympics, Biles unexpectedly dropped out during the team performance, which the U.S. team won a silver medal.\n\nBiles dropped out to focus on her mental health and said she had a case of the twisties, where her body and mind were not aligned, and put an emphasis on her safety over continuing to compete.\n\nThe move was praised by many athletes and Biles' sponsors, but a man running for U.S. Senate at the time took exception to the praise for the gymnast.\n\n\"I think it reflects poorly on our sort of therapeutic society that we try to praise people, not for moments of strength, not for moments of heroism, but for their weakest moments,\" J.D. Vance said in an interview at the time.\n\nVance was critical of how Biles was being perceived by the public.\n\n\"We've tried to turn a very tragic moment, Simone Biles quitting the Olympic team, into this act of heroism.\"\n\nNow the vice-presidential pick for the 2024 election alongside Donald Trump, past comments by Vance have gone viral during the 2024 Summer Olympics.\n\nDemocratic National Committee spokeswoman Aida Ross said Vance has no room to talk about \"anyone else's weakest moments,\" as reported by the New York Times.\n\n\"While the rest of the country is celebrating the U.S.A. women's gymnastics team's performance at the Olympics, J.D. Vance is facing his weakest moment amid a gaffe-filled rollout that has left him as the most unpopular V.P. pick in decades,\" Ross said.\n\nRead Also: How Much Are Physical 2024 Olympic Gold Medal, Silver Medal And Bronze Medals Worth? The Answer Might Surprise You\n\nWhy It's Important: The past criticism from Vance could paint a picture of his lack of support and empathy for those dealing with mental health issues and comes at a time when Olympic athletes are being celebrated.\n\nBiles had therapy sessions with her U.S.-based therapist during the Olympics, according to the report.\n\n\"The Olympics is such a draining process for the athletes when it's multiple days of competition, so you definitely have to be on top of your mental, as well as your physical,\" Biles said.\n\nBiles also said that past negative comments were painful at the time and hurtful, but the people who criticized her are now \"really quiet.\"\n\n\"After all these years of putting the mental work in, it's paid off.\"\n\nWhile sponsors have dropped athletes for performance issues or for off-the-field issues, Biles saw support from some of her biggest sponsors after dropping out of the 2020 Summer Olympics.\n\n\"We stand by Simone and support her well-being both in and out of competition,\" Athleta said at the time. \"Being the best also means knowing how to take care of yourself.\"\n\nAthleta, which is owned by Gap Inc GPS, landed Biles to a deal in 2021 pulling her away from apparel giant Nike Inc NKE. Biles said at the time that Athleta aligned better with her values and came as the larger apparel company was facing accusations of poor treatment towards female athletes.\n\nSponsor Visa Inc V also supported Biles after she withdrew from the 2020 games saying the gymnast was \"incredibly brave.\"\n\nCoca-Cola Co KO-owned Core Power said Biles showed that \"her courage and strength extend well beyond the mat\" at the time.\n\nThe brands that stuck by Biles were supportive again in the 2024 Olympics, with Coca-Cola making the gymnast the face of its Powerade brand's Olympic campaign. A commercial called \"The Vault,\" featured Biles navigating challenges and triumphs in life. The Powerade brand put an emphasis on athletes' mental and physical wellbeing with its Olympic sponsorship and launched its \"Pause is Power\" platform in 2022.\n\nWhile Vance will either win or lose in the 2024 presidential election, Biles is very much already a winner in 2024 and one of the most celebrated American Olympic athletes ever.\n\nCheck This Out:\n\n* Lawmakers Made Huge Investments This Year.

Reynolds has not yet publicly endorsed a candidate in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nWith the 2024 presidential election around the corner, celebrities have voiced their support for Republican nominee former President Donald Trump or presumptive Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAn image recently went viral on social media appearing to show \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" star Ryan Reynolds wearing a t-shirt that says \"Kamala removes nasty orange stains,\" in the shape of a Tide logo, referencing Harris and Trump.\n\nSome people who commented on the photo claimed the image is fake.\n\nIs the image of Ryan Reynolds wearing a Kamala Harris shirt real?\n\nNo, the image of Ryan Reynolds wearing a Kamala Harris shirt isn't real.\n\nThe image of Ryan Reynolds wearing a Kamala Harris shirt isn't real. There are signs this image was likely created using artificial intelligence.\n\nGenerative AI is a technology that can produce new content, including images, videos, audio and text based on a prompt.\n\nVERIFY analyzed the image and determined there are a number of visual cues that it is fake.\n\nThe hands on what appears to be Reynolds' body are misshapen and pixelated, with the knuckles on the thumb protruding more than normal. His skin looks too smooth in several places and his ears in the viral photo are much smaller than Reynolds' real ears. There is also a shadow under his jaw line onto his neck that does not look realistic. Reynolds appears to be wearing a watch, but a closer look shows the watch face is covered with pink dots.\n\nReynolds' nose in the viral image does not match real pictures of him. There is also a tattoo on the left forearm in the viral image, which appears misshapen and cut off. Reynolds doesn't have a tattoo there. On Instagram, he has posted several images while wearing short sleeve shirts and a similar tattoo can't be seen in any of them.\n\nA close look at the shirt in the viral image also contains clues that it's likely AI-generated. Even though the shirt is wrinkled, the image looks flat. The image's colors are much more vibrant than anything else in the photo, and the shirt's black color appears to bleed down one side of Reynolds' arm - another sign of an AI-generated photo.\n\nVERIFY also conducted a reverse image search using RevEye and found no reputable sources have published the photo of Reynolds wearing a Harris shirt. That is another indicator this image is made with artificial intelligence. Reynolds is a high-profile celebrity and if he was seen wearing this shirt, it would have been covered by the media.\n\nReynolds has also not publicly endorsed a candidate in the current presidential election. Reynolds was born and raised in Canada and became a U.S. citizen in 2018. He voted for the first time in the 2020 election, but did not share who he voted for.\n\nVERIFY reached out to Reynolds' camp for comment and did not hear back at the time of publication."],"source":{"uri":["13wmaz.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["WMAZ"]},"authors":[{"uri":["kelly_jones@13wmaz.com"],"name":["Kelly Jones"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://media.13wmaz.com/assets/VERIFY/images/d11900c8-7046-4b9a-ad4e-71ff0481b090/20240805T211247/d11900c8-7046-4b9a-ad4e-71ff0481b090_1140x641.jpg"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[-0.0353],"wgt":[460591499],"relevance":[13]},{"uri":["8260789853"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-05"],"time":["22:00:46"],"dateTime":["2024-08-05T22:00:46Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-05T22:00:18Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.8157],"url":["https://atlantablackstar.com/2024/08/05/maga-supporters-rip-apart-kyle-rittenhouse-for-declaring-that-he-wont-vote-for-donald-trump/"],"title":["'You Don't Backstab Trump': MAGA Supporters Rip Apart Kyle Rittenhouse for Declaring that He Won't Vote for Donald Trump In 2024 Election, 12 Hours Later He Walked Back His Comments"],"body":["Kyle Rittenhouse is creating a stir online among Donald Trump's supporters for declaring that he would not vote for the former president in the 2024 presidential election, then walking back that statement.\n\nRittenhouse posted a video to his X account on Thursday, Aug. 1, stating that he'd be writing in former Texas congressman Ron Paul on the ballot rather than Trump.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Donald Trump had bad advisors making him bad on the Second Amendment and that is my issue.

In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in.

Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change.

The decision comes Monday after the Missouri attorney general had argued in the unusual request that the New York gag order wrongly limits what the GOP presidential nominee could say on the campaign trail and Trump's eventual sentence could affect his ability to travel. New York countered that the limited gag order does allow Trump to talk about the issues important to voters, and the sentence may not affect his movement at all.\n\nWhat's the deal with the Olympics?

That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.\n\nIn Israel and Lebanon, life goes on even as the region teeters on the edge of all-out war\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- In Beirut, shops are open and traffic is as snarled as ever. In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Everyone expects that an all-out war would be far more devastating than any previous conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nBangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.\n\nSupreme Court shuts down Missouri's long shot push to lift Trump's gag order in hush-money case\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court has shut down a long-shot push from Missouri seeking to remove a gag order in former President Donald Trump's hush-money case and delay his sentencing in New York. The decision comes Monday after the Missouri attorney general had argued in the unusual request that the New York gag order wrongly limits what the GOP presidential nominee could say on the campaign trail and Trump's eventual sentence could affect his ability to travel. New York countered that the limited gag order does allow Trump to talk about the issues important to voters, and the sentence may not affect his movement at all.\n\nWhat's the deal with the Olympics?

The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed a 12.4% plunge for Japan's Nikkei 225, its worst since 1987. Treasury yields pared their losses after a report showed U.S. services businesses are continuing to grow. But worries are still high after Friday's report showing U.S. employers pulled back on hiring last month by more than expected.\n\nTropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia and the Carolinas\n\nHORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with torrential rain and high winds, contributing to at least four deaths as it turned menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatened to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities. The storm made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 50 mph. More than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia. Local leaders in Savannah, Georgia, were preparing for high water in case Debby stalls out over the city. An official in Charleston, South Carolina, says Debby could be a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event.\"\n\nGoogle illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. After reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\nEx-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people charged in the case have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Rudy Giuliani at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She had pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.\n\nRally dates are set.

(Charly Triballeau/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nU.S. stocks took a nosedive on Monday amid a worldwide stock market selloff as fears of a possible U.S. recession have mounted in recent days.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1,033.99 to close at 38,703, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 3.43 percent and closed at 16,200. The S&P 500 slid 3 percent.\n\nAlready on Monday, Japan's Nikkei 225 index nosedived about 12 percent, the worst rout in its history, Japan's Topix index fell 12.2 percent. Yields on U.S. government bonds hit multi-month lows, with the 10-year note last at 3.68 percent, while the two-year slipped to 3.69 percent.\n\nA weak jobs report from the U.S. Department of Labor last week coupled with shrinking manufacturing activity in the world's largest economy as well as dismal forecasts from top U.S. technology companies pushed the Nasdaq 100 lower as well.\n\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs also noted the Fed's ability to boost market optimism, estimating a 25 percent likelihood of a U.S. recession, whereas JPMorgan analysts were more bearish, assigning a 50 percent probability to a recession. \"Now that the Fed looks to be materially behind the curve, we expect a [basis points] cut at the September meeting, followed by another 50 [basis points] cut in November,\" said economist Michael Feroli.\n\nMajor Wall Street brokerages also revised their Federal Reserve rate projections for 2024 to show greater policy easing by the central bank.\n\n\"I don't think the Fed would go 50 basis points because at the same time it would imply that the Fed was wrong, that a recession is right around the corner and it would do more to increase investor tension than it would to calm nerves,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. \"If anything, I would say that the Fed might engage in an intra meeting, easing of 25 basis points to let the markets know that it is on top of the issue.\"\n\nOn Monday morning, Chicago Fed President Austan Goosbee said in a CNBC segment that the U.S. central bank would react to signs of weakness in the economy, indicating that interest rates are too high.\n\n\"The Fed's job is very straightforward, maximize employment, stabilize prices and maintain financial stability. That's what we're going to do,\" Goosbee said during CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" show. \"We're forward-looking about it.

The law makes it a crime to call the war a \"war\" rather than a \"special military operation\" on social media or in a news article or broadcast. The law is understood to penalize any language that \"discredits\" Russia's use of its military in Ukraine, calls for sanctions or protests Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It punishes anyone found to spread \"false information\" about the invasion with up to 15 years in prison.\n\nVitaliy Ryumshin discusses why Joe Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race does not change the balance of power in the U.S.\n\nThere have been some surprising developments in the U.S. presidential race. In an unprecedented move, President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the race on July 21, just a few weeks before he was expected to become the Democratic Party's nominee. This decision came after a Democratic uprising following Biden's poor showing in a televised debate with Donald Trump. Subsequently, many of the president's allies pushed him to drop out. Biden resisted until the last moment, but eventually, he was forced to step aside when nearly the entire Democratic leadership turned against him.\n\nWhile the Democratic camp was in disarray, the situation significantly improved for Trump. First, the Republican nominee prevailed over his opponent in the debate, and then the U.S. Supreme Court issued favorable rulings in several major criminal cases Trump faces. Following this, Trump miraculously escaped assassination and spoke at a triumphant Republican National Convention just two days later. Adding to this, Biden is now out of the race. So, it seems that nothing can stop Trump from returning to the White House.\n\nBut is that really the case? Well, if you're a Trump fan, you're in for a disappointment: Biden's departure does not guarantee his opponent will be reelected.\n\nIndeed, the former president still faces many problems. Trump is enmeshed in never-ending scandals, his approval rating remains stubbornly low, and he has failed to unite the country, although recently, he seemed to make some progress toward that end. Moreover, in May and June, people had hoped that the former president had matured politically. After all, Trump reconciled with moderate Republicans, attended the Libertarian Party convention, and aligned himself with the Silicon Valley tech giants who had previously supported the Democrats. However, it all crumbled when he named radical Trumpist Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance as his running mate. That's when it became clear that for Trump, ideological affinity and personal loyalty were still more important than political shrewdness.\n\nSo far, Trump has been able to cleverly hide his incompetence behind Biden's shortcomings. Indeed, Biden had behaved strangely at public events and, at times, made utterly no sense. America talked about nothing other than Biden's deteriorating health, which was getting worse by the month. Against this backdrop, an upbeat Trump looked like a worthy alternative.\n\nNow that Biden is no longer in the race, his vice president, Kamala Harris, is getting ready to run against the Republican nominee. She is a relatively young (59-year-old) Black woman with Indian ancestry. People consider her modern enough to become a TikTok phenomenon and she is relatively popular with independent voters, minorities and young people. In contrast, Trump now seems like America's grandfather in chief, someone who should retire.\n\nTrump needs to offer voters more than just the promise of clear thinking and staying healthy if he is to maintain his momentum.\n\nMeanwhile, the Democrats are also facing challenges. They made a significant mistake by fully committing to a risky Biden nomination, which almost caused a rift in the party. However, after dealing with this crisis, the Democratic Party has pinned its hopes on Harris, a highly questionable candidate.\n\nIndeed, Harris has many shortcomings. She lacks charisma and public speaking skills, and her speeches are word salads. Her awkward jokes and uncontrollable laughter have turned her into a meme.\n\nMoreover, her track record is far from perfect. Harris unsuccessfully ran for president in 2019, losing in the Democratic primaries due to a poorly organized campaign. As vice president, she struggled to handle the immigrant crisis and alienated 90% of her staff with her toxic behavior. In the last few years, Harris' role has been reduced to occasionally standing in for Biden at events he didn't wish to attend.\n\nTherefore, by all accounts, Harris should never have become a successful politician. Americans seem to agree. Her approval rating is lower than Biden's, and her disapproval rating is comparable to Trump's. However, despite her shortcomings, Democrats have consistently promoted her within the party, possibly because she is the ultimate diversity, equity and inclusion candidate.\n\nNow Harris is faced with the challenge of reviving the Democratic presidential campaign as quickly as possible. This includes selecting a running mate, distancing herself from Biden, and combating racism and sexism, which are deeply ingrained in American society. Accomplishing this will require precise and well-coordinated efforts from a large team, significant funding, and minimal mistakes from Harris herself. While she will have access to the necessary resources, there are concerns about whether, given her track record, Harris will use them effectively. It's important to note that Harris did not independently participate in the primaries, which may lead some to think of her as the candidate no one chose.\n\nAs such, the crucial point is that what appeared to be significant changes in American politics have not produced any actual results.\n\nThe U.S. presidential election may change in its details, but the general situation remains the same. It's a contest between the bad and the worst, between the intolerable and the incompetent. And whoever wins the 2024 presidential election won't necessarily be the one who most deserves it, but the one who disgraces themselves the least."],"source":{"uri":["watchingamerica.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Watching America"]},"authors":[],"image":{},"eventUri":["eng-9789442"],"sentiment":[-0.3333],"wgt":[460589414],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8260762818"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-05"],"time":["21:29:54"],"dateTime":["2024-08-05T21:29:54Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-05T21:28:35Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.7412],"url":["https://theconservativetreehouse.com/blog/2024/08/05/congressman-jamie-raskin-seriously-and-strategically-promises-to-incite-a-civil-war-by-blocking-trump-from-office-if-president-trump-wins-in-november/"],"title":["Congressman Jamie Raskin Seriously and Strategically Promises to Incite \"A Civil War\" by Blocking Trump from Office if President Trump Wins in November - The Last Refuge"],"body":["Putting some context data together before a video that should concern everyone.\n\nRepresentative Jamie Raskin's (U-MD) son, Tommy Raskin killed himself right after the 2020 election at the age of 25.

The storm made landfall on the gulf coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 65 mph. More than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia. At least four storm-related deaths have been reported.

An official in South Carolina says Debby could be a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event.\"\n\nGoogle illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. After reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\nEx-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case.

Seventeen other people charged in the case have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges.

After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election.

Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah.

Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change.

The decision comes Monday after the Missouri attorney general had argued in the unusual request that the New York gag order wrongly limits what the GOP presidential nominee could say on the campaign trail and Trump's eventual sentence could affect his ability to travel. New York countered that the limited gag order does allow Trump to talk about the issues important to voters, and the sentence may not affect his movement at all.\n\nWhat's the deal with the Olympics?

The opposition claims to have collected records from more than 80% of the 30,000 polling booths nationwide showing it won.\n\nMaduro announced Saturday that the government has arrested 2,000 opponents and at a rally in Caracas he pledged to detain more people and send them to prison. The post-electoral uprising has also claimed at least 11 deaths, according to Foro Penal, a Caracas-based human rights group.\n\nGonzález and Machado in their missive called on Venezuelans with family members serving in the security forces to urge their loved ones not to attack protesters and obey illegal orders. It said it would offer \"guarantees\" to soldiers who follow the constitution even while promising there would be no impunity for those behind abuses and following illegal orders.\n\nBoth González, a former diplomat, and Machado - who was barred by the government from running - have gone into hiding, saying they fear they will be arrested or killed. Maduro and his cadres have threatened to lock them both up.\n\nAs Venezuelans fight Maduro on the streets, pressure is also building internationally for the Venezuelan government to publish the full breakdown of the electoral results.\n\nBut so far, Maduro has instead asked the country's supreme court - which like all institutions in Venezuela is packed with loyalists - to review any claims of irregularities.\n\n\"Respect for popular sovereignty is what moves us to defend the transparency of the (election) results,\" Brazil´s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said Monday in a press conference alongside fellow leftist President Gabriel Boric of Chile.\n\nBoric, who cast doubt on Maduro´s victory claim in an unexpectedly strong statement within hours of Venezuela´s July 28 election, told reporters that he and Lula discussed the situation in Venezuela on Monday, without elaborating. The leaders did not take questions and their carefully worded statements signaled how leftist leaders in the region are gingerly trying to show respect for Venezuela's sovereignty while voicing doubts about the official results.\n\nA few of Maduro´s staunch allies - including Russia, China and Cuba - have applauded his victory.

Prosecutors said while they did not believe the items should be returned because they were still considered evidence, if they gave them back, it would mean Chansley must assure the court there would be no further challenges to his criminal conviction.\n\nIn a 6-page order on Monday, Senior U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth wrote:\n\nDefendant Jacob Anthony Chansley stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021. In that respect, he was like thousands of others that day. But he stood out to the entire world because of his \"unmistakable outfit\" of \"a horned coyote-tail headdress; red, white, and blue face paint; gloves; and no shirt.\" [Citation omitted] In addition, he had armed himself with a serious weapon: \"a six-foot pole with an American flag ziptied to the shaft and a metal spearhead fixed to the top.\"\n\nMr. Chansley has completed his prison sentence and much of his term of supervised release. Now, he has moved for the return of his property seized and still held by the government, including his spear and helmet. Since the government has not established that it still needs these items as evidence and has not sought their forfeiture, the Court will GRANT Mr. Chansley's motion.\n\nChansley was sentenced in November 2021 to 41 months in prison and 36 months supervised release. Originally facing six charges, he struck a plea deal and pleaded guilty to only one count: obstruction of an official proceeding, a charge recently narrowed by the U.S. Supreme Court in Fischer v. United States.\n\nAll told, Chansley was incarcerated for 11 months before being released to a halfway house in March 2023 so he could start his supervised release program. When he tried to end that early, prosecutors reminded Lamberth that though the judge was effusive with his praise of Chansley at sentencing -- he had called Chansley's mea culpa \"the most remarkable I've heard in 34 years\" and \"akin to the kind of thing Martin Luther King would have said\" -- it was just two years after that when the judge expressed a certain degree of buyer's remorse.\n\nLamberth had learned that Chansley gave interviews to the press that were a far cry from contrite; the defendant said that he regretted pleading guilty.\n\nLamberth acknowledged this in his Monday order as well as Chansley's subsequent appeal. That appeal didn't go far because Chansley withdrew it. But he then he moved to vacate his sentence, claiming he had new evidence to vindicate himself and further, that he had \"ineffective assistance of his plea counsel.\"\n\nThat motion was denied and the judge reminded Chansley of that fact on Monday -- as well as his prior \"disappointment that 'Mr. Chansley has recanted the contrition displayed at his sentencing.'\"\n\nIn a footnote of the order, Lamberth notably included a snippet of Chansley's statement from sentencing that had so moved the judge and came back to bite him later:\n\nSo I had to come to terms with the fact that I was in solitary confinement because of me, because of my decision. I broke the law, and if I believe in freedom, if I believe in law and order, if I believe in responsibility and accountability, then that means that I should do what Gandhi would do and take responsibility even and especially when it incriminates me,\" Chansley said at sentencing. \"No ifs, ands, or buts about it. That's what men of honor do. I am truly, truly repentant for my actions, because repentance is not just saying you're sorry. Repentance is apologizing and then moving in the exact opposite direction of the sin that you committed. And that's what I've been trying to do ever since I realized the magnitude of my error and the magnitude of my mistake. [I]n retrospect, I would do everything differently on January 6. In all honesty, I would do everything differently.\n\nThough the \"QAnon Shaman\" will have his iconic spear and fur-lined helmet back, Lamberth was silent on Chansley's July request for an early release from supervised probation.\n\nInstead, the judge said only that the government had failed to establish why Chansley's property was \"evidence\" at this stage and that it was not clear to him \"how Mr. Chansley could contest his conviction, as he has been sentenced, abandoned his direct appeal, and seen his § 2255 motion denied.\"\n\n\"But even if the government may need to reprove Mr. Chansley's guilt, the government has not explained why it would need his property,\" Lamberth wrote, adding that it was not enough for prosecutors to suggest the government may \"eventually\" seek civil forfeiture.\n\nWhile Chansley was the \"face of the riot,\" the judge wrote, and \"images of him at the Capitol on that day abound,\" three years have passed and prosecutors have \"never sought forfeiture of the property involved in the Capitol siege.\"\n\n\"As there is voluminous video and photo evidence of Mr. Chansley's conduct, his property is of little utility for an investigation or prosecution and 'the United States' legitimate interests can be satisfied even if the property is returned ... The Court therefore finds that the retention of Mr. Chansley's property would be unreasonable,\" the judge wrote.\n\nProsecutors may have an \"interest\" in using \"the evidence of its choice,\" such as a weapon used to commit an offense, he added, and \"the government may well have been able to articulate a compelling reason to retain Mr. Chansley's property.\"\n\n\"But when the government has vast amounts of other evidence, it cannot defeat a Rule 41(g) motion simply by asserting its desire to retain the evidence without giving any reasons,\" the judge wrote."],"source":{"uri":["lawandcrime.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Law & Crime"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://lawandcrime.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/chansley-getty.jpg"],"eventUri":["eng-9792722"],"sentiment":[-0.098],"wgt":[460588421],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["2024-08-444993665"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-05"],"time":["21:12:14"],"dateTime":["2024-08-05T21:12:14Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-05T20:30:52Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.5333],"url":["https://cryptonews.com/news/former-president-trump-proposes-bitcoin-for-35-trillion-u-s-debt-crisis.htm"],"title":["Former President Trump Proposes Bitcoin for $35 Trillion U.S. Debt Crisis"],"body":["Former President Donald Trump has suggested using Bitcoin or a \"crypto check\" to address the United States' staggering $35 trillion national debt.\n\nDuring an interview on Fox News, Trump, the Republican Party's 2024 presidential nominee, praised the crypto industry and warned that America must innovate in the digital asset space to keep pace with other countries.\n\nHe even highlighted the potential role of Bitcoin in resolving the national debt crisis.\n\n\"Who knows, maybe we'll pay off our $35 trillion dollar [national debt], hand them a little crypto check, right? We'll hand them a little Bitcoin and wipe away our $35 trillion,\" he stated.\n\nUS Government Faces Mounting Debt\n\nThe former president's proposal comes at a time when the US government is facing significant challenges due to its mounting debt.\n\nThe continuous devaluation of the dollar, driven by excessive currency printing to service outstanding debts, has contributed to Bitcoin's rising value relative to fiat currency.\n\nTo illustrate the gravity of the situation, it took around 200 years for the US national debt to reach $1 trillion.\n\nToday, the same amount is added to the debt approximately every three months due to deficit spending.\n\nIn June, about 76% of all income tax revenue was used to pay interest on the debt, making it one of the largest expenses in the US fiscal budget.\n\nBitcoin, with its supply-capped nature, could potentially siphon value from the current US dollar system, thereby averting a full-blown currency collapse similar to the Weimar Republic in the early 20th century.\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has also echoed this sentiment, suggesting that establishing a Bitcoin reserve could help the government pay off its national debt as Bitcoin appreciates in value.\n\nLummis Proposes Bitcoin as Strategic Reserve\n\nMoreover, Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced a bill to establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve in the United States.\n\nThe initiative aims to counteract the negative effects of rampant monetary printing and preserve the US's financial dominance in global markets and trade.\n\nThe Wyoming Senator has proposed that the US Treasury acquire 5% of Bitcoin's total supply and hold the decentralized asset for at least 20 years as a safeguard against monetary devaluation by the Federal Reserve and poor fiscal policy.\n\nNotably, Trump's stance on cryptocurrencies has evolved over time.\n\nDespite previously criticizing Bitcoin as a \"scam,\" he has recently changed his tune.\n\nOn June 14, he declared that he would end the Biden administration's \"war on crypto\" if elected president.\n\nTrump had also previously criticized Biden for his harsh stance on cryptocurrencies, emphasizing that the United States should strive to be a leader in the crypto industry.\n\nAs reported, a survey conducted by the Harris Poll has revealed that one in three voters in the US consider a candidate's position on cryptocurrencies before making their voting decision.\n\nAnother survey conducted by leading crypto venture capital firm Paradigm reveals that Trump's poll numbers for the 2024 US Presidential Election enjoy significant support from the crypto community."],"source":{"uri":["cryptonews.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["cryptonews.com"]},"authors":[{"uri":["ruholamin_haqshanas@cryptonews.com"],"name":["Ruholamin Haqshanas"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/03095938/1722679177-1717997039-1716708077-1709453028-1709453012230_processed.jpg"],"eventUri":["eng-9785391"],"sentiment":[0.0745],"wgt":[460588334],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8260740335"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-05"],"time":["21:05:09"],"dateTime":["2024-08-05T21:05:09Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-05T21:04:28Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.4902],"url":["https://www.yahoo.com/news/kamala-harris-went-political-science-201603834.html"],"title":["Kamala Harris Went From A Political Science Major At Howard University To Becoming The Democratic Presidential Nominee In The 2024 Election"],"body":["Since 1908, the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc. and its members have made their marks across several industries and impacted communities and spaces.\n\nSome influential members include Phylicia Rashad, Coretta Scott King, Rosa Parks, Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison, and Vice President Kamala Harris, according to ESSENCE.\n\nHarris was officially sworn in as vice president of the United States on Jan. 20, 2021, making her the first woman, Black person, and South Asian American to be elected to the office. While this historical marker is noteworthy, it was not the beginning of her story.\n\nA native of Oakland, CA, Harris' roots in education and public service start with the influence of her mother, Shyamala Gopalan. According to a profile from the White House, Gopalan earned her doctorate in 1964, the same year Harris was born, and worked as a breast cancer scientist.\n\nHarris' father, Donald J. Harris, came to the United States from Jamaica to study economics at the University of California, Berkeley. He is currently a professor emeritus of economics at Stanford University.\n\nInfluenced by her mother and father's academic work, Harris graduated from Westmount High School near Montreal, Canada, where she moved with her mother after her parents divorced. Harris then began her collegiate studies back in the U.S. at Howard University. Attending one of the country's HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) was likely influenced by the cultural and social upbringings of her parents.\n\nIn her memoir, \"The Truths We Hold: An American Journey,\" she discusses her parents' work and participation during the Civil Rights movement as well as her mother's acknowledgment of raising her and her sister, Maya, as Black girls in America.\n\n\"My mother understood very well that she was raising two Black daughters,\" Harris wrote in the memoir. \"She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as Black girls, and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud Black women.\"\n\nDuring her time at the HBCU, Harris was affiliated with the College of Arts and Sciences Student Council, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc., and the debate team, per a Howard University profile.\n\nHarris majored in political science and economics, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1986. She described her time at Howard as critical, naming them her \"formative years.\"\n\n\"The thing that Howard taught me is that you can do any collection of things and not one thing to the exclusion of the other. You could be homecoming queen and valedictorian. There are no false choices at Howard,\" Harris stated via a Howard University profile.\n\nUpon graduating from Howard, Harris attended law school at the University of California Hastings, College of Law.\n\nWhile there in February 1989, Harris advocated for Black students after a Black History Month display was defaced with racial slurs. According to Politico, Harris stood before approximately 300 students, faculty, and staff, detailing the incident and demanding change.\n\nHer law school education led her to become a prosecutor, state attorney general, U.S. senator of California, and vice president of the United States.\n\nHarris is running a historic campaign for president of the United States. After President Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential election, Harris took over his campaign operation, leading to a surge in donations.\n\nAccording to a separate Politico report, Harris' Democratic campaign now has $377 million in cash on hand, which is $50 million more than the Trump campaign.\n\nMorehouse College alumni called the 1867 PAC. Additionally, Harris has experienced an uptick in support from members of the Divine Nine, which consist of the nine recognized Black Greek-letter organizations (BGLOs).\n\nAccording to Inside Higher Ed, BGLO members, particularly Alpha Kappa Alpha, have rallied behind the vice president's campaign for president.\n\nA large number of AKA members joined a 44,000-person Zoom call. The group, Win With Black Women, organized the gathering on the day President Biden withdrew from the presidential race. During this meeting, the organization raised $1.5 million for the Harris campaign, according to The New York Times."],"source":{"uri":["yahoo.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Yahoo"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://media.zenfs.com/en/afrotech_articles_589/6e290ca97b2cdf1b943d776fee2b76e5"],"eventUri":["eng-9788867"],"sentiment":[0.0588],"wgt":[460587909],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["2024-08-444990006"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-05"],"time":["21:03:45"],"dateTime":["2024-08-05T21:03:45Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-05T20:47:36Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/briefing/06ambriefing-asia-global-stocks-bangladesh-harris.html"],"title":["Tuesday Briefing: Global Markets Fell"],"body":["Stocks tumbled over fears of a U.S. economic slowdown\n\nA wave of anxiety rippled through financial markets yesterday. Stocks fell in the U.S. and around the world as investors zeroed in on signs of a slowing American economy.\n\nThe drop extended a sell-off that began on Friday after the U.S. released a jobs report that showed the highest level of unemployment in nearly three years. This deepened fears that the world's largest economy could be headed for slower growth.\n\nIn the U.S., the S&P 500 fell 3 percent, its worst day since September 2022. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index dropped 12.4 percent, its biggest one-day point decline. The FTSE 100, Britain's benchmark index, had its worst day since July 2023, falling just over 2 percent.\n\nThere were other factors at play in the plunge: concerns that tech stocks had run up too far, too fast, and that a strengthening yen could hurt the prospects of Japanese companies and some global traders. In the U.S., some questioned whether the Federal Reserve may have waited too long before cutting interest rates. Here's the latest on the market meltdown.\n\nTime to sell?

Almost 100 people were reported killed on Sunday, the deadliest day of the unrest.\n\nResponding to the bloodshed, the protesters marched to Hasina's residence. Hasina fled in a helicopter, and a crowd stormed the building. Looters made off with furniture, bedding and potted plants. Hasina's current location isn't clear. She has family in both the U.S. and Britain.\n\nHere's the latest.\n\nBackground: Hasina, 76, was one of the world's longest-serving female leaders.

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby is slamming Florida with catastrophic flooding and could bring potentially record-setting rain to Georgia and South Carolina. The storm made landfall on the gulf coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 65 mph. More than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia. At least four storm-related deaths have been reported.

The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. After reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\nEx-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case.

Seventeen other people charged in the case have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges.

After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election.

That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history.

In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah.

Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change.

Some of those postings were menacing in nature including one claiming the 59-year-old politician would regret running for the presidency after he plucked \"out her eyes with a pair of pliers.\"\n\nCarillo is also accused of threatening to shoot anyone who tried to protect Harris in that July 27 post.\n\nAnother comment on the suspect's GETTER account calls for someone to incinerate the Democratic candidate.\n\n\"Kamala Harris needs to be put on fire alive,\" he wrote the same day, according to a Friday court filing. \"I will do it personally if no one else does it. I want her to suffer a slow agonizing death.\"\n\nAlso last week, Carillo allegedly wrote to Harris \"Just for being a Democrat you're going to die.\"\n\nLaw enforcement officers said in an affidavit they found a rifle and a handgun in the suspect's home Winchester, Virginia, home during a search last week. When police came to Carillo's door, he reportedly asked if their visit was \"about the online stuff\" and didn't deny posting the messages.\n\nThe 2024 presidential election is shaping up to be highly contentious. Republican candidate Donald Trump has recently escalated his attempts to draw attention to Harris being a woman of color.\n\nHe's also planted the seed that, if he loses in November, it will be because the election was somehow rigged. He made that same false assertion after being defeated handily by President Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nDays before the Republican National Committee made Trump its presidential candidate for third straight time last month, a Pennsylvania gunman fired several shots at the 78-year-old Queens native at a rally, wounding the nominee's ear.\n\nIt remains unclear why the shooter, a 20-year-old registered Republican, attempted to assassinate the party's representative to lead the country.\n\nHarris put out a statement condemning the \"abhorrent act\" that nearly killed her opponent.\n\n©2024 New York Daily News.

Although she could win the election without it, Pennsylvania's 19 Electoral College votes would give her a much easier path to the 270 needed to defeat former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe state is roughly divided between Democrats and Republicans, backing Trump in 2016 but flipping back to Democrats to support President Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nHarris emerged as the Democratic presidential nominee after Biden withdrew from the race last month amid pressure from Democrats concerned about polls showing Trump leading key states, including Pennsylvania. Biden's poll numbers slipped following his debate against Trump in June, which fueled concerns about his age and ability to win in November.\n\nFor months, Harris polled similarly, or behind Biden. But her ascent to the top of the ticket sparked a wave of Democratic enthusiasm, and fundraising, that has shifted polls in her direction, giving Democrats more confidence about their ability to win.\n\nA new poll of Pennsylvania voters released on Monday showed Trump trailing Harris in the Keystone State.\n\nThe GQR poll found Harris leading Trump by four percentage pints (50 percent to 46 percent). Two percent of respondents said they were leaning toward other candidates, and another two percent remained undecided, according to the survey.\n\nIt polled 500 likely voters from July 26 to July 30, 2024 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.38 percentage points.\n\nThe poll comes as Harris is set to hold a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday with her running mate, who is yet to be announced. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro is viewed as a front-runner to become her vice presidential candidate, due largely to his electoral success in the state in past elections.\n\nOther polls have pointed to a tight race since Harris became the Democratic nominee. On Monday, FiveThirtyEight's polling aggregate showed the two candidates nearly tied, with Harris receiving average support of 45.3 percent and Trump averaging 44.4 percent.\n\nA Fabrizio, Lee & Associates poll, conducted among 600 likely voters from July 29 to August 1, found the race tied. In a two-way race, each received 48 percent. When Kennedy was included, they each received 45 percent support, according to the poll.\n\nMeanwhile, a Public Policy Polling survey, conducted among 627 registered voters from July 29 to 30, found Trump with a 1-point lead (48 percent to 47 percent).\n\nA Public Opinion Strategies poll, conducted among 400 likely voters from July 23 to 29, found Harris with a 3-point lead (48 percent to 45 percent).\n\nNewsweek reached out to the Harris and Trump campaigns for comment via email.\n\nHarris and her running mate are expected to travel to the key swing states this week to continue building enthusiasm, as well as winning over undecided swing voters who could determine the outcome of the election.\n\nIn addition to Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina and Wisconsin are viewed as the most competitive states. Biden won all but North Carolina in 2020.\n\nBiden carried Pennsylvania by only 1.2 points in 2020, winning 50 percent of the vote to Trump's 48.8 percent. In 2016, Trump won by an even smaller margin, winning 48.2 percent of the vote compared to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's 47.5 percent."],"source":{"uri":["miamiherald.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Miami Herald"]},"authors":[{"uri":["andrew_stanton@miamiherald.com"],"name":["Andrew Stanton"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/5jm61t/picture290771914/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/7afe4121-c8be-4f9c-aade-554f80be1d96"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.1608],"wgt":[460587090],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["2024-08-444979611"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-05"],"time":["20:50:34"],"dateTime":["2024-08-05T20:50:34Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-05T20:46:42Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.7255],"url":["https://newsghana.com.gh/asuogyaman-lower-manya-yilo-krobo-constituencies-fall-for-bawumia/"],"title":["Asuogyaman, Lower Manya & Yilo Krobo Constituencies Fall For Bawumia"],"body":["The atmosphere in the Asuogyaman, Lower Manya and Yilo Krobo constituencies was electrifying when the flagbearer of the ruling New Patriotic Party, Dr. Mahaamudu Bawumia, visited them.\n\nUnlike in the past, thousands of people trooped to the various meeting grounds to listen to the message of Dr. Bawumia amidst cheers and applause.\n\nThe unprecedented crowd were treated to various songs composed by different musicians for the NPP's 2024 campaign which has kicked off in earnest.\n\nThe Vice President used the occasion to explain to the mammoth crowds his policy proposals and urged them to vote for not only him as president but the parliamentary candidates on the ticket of the NPP.\n\nDr. Bawumia emphasized that a vote for him would translate into \"bold solutions,\" while a vote for his main opponent, former President John Mahama, meant \"a vote for old solutions.\"\n\nDr. Bawumia highlighted his achievements as Vice President, including resolving generational issues, and promised to do more as president.\n\nHe outlined his new ideas and bold solutions, such as a new tax system, training one million young Ghanaians in coding and software applications, revising the National Service Scheme, and implementing a Ghana Card for passport policy.\n\nThe NPP Flagbearer also compared the records of the NPP and NDC, showcasing the NPP's superior achievements in education, economic indicators, healthcare, tourism, sports infrastructure, digitalization, and more.\n\nHe highlighted the NPP's flagship programs, including Free SHS, One District One Ambulance, expanded health insurance, free basic education and school feeding, District Road Improvement Program, LEAP, and reinstated nurses and teacher training allowances.\n\nDr Bawumia also emphasized the NPP's commitment to security, recruitment of over 30,000 personnel, and the One District One Factory initiative, which has created jobs and stimulated local economies.\n\nHe urged the party's rank and file to work hard to win the 2024 presidential election and parliamentary majority.\n\nDr. Bawumia's message was clear: he is the candidate with bold solutions for Ghana's future, and the NPP has a proven track record of transforming the lives of Ghanaians across the country.\n\n\"We are poised to vote for the NPP this time around because we believe Bawumia has the solutions that can change the destiny of this country\" a young lady who had come to witness the event stated.\n\nAnother constituent had this to say: \"The number of people who came out to see Dr. Bawumia are extraordinary huge.

This development has sparked a whirlwind of activity within the Democratic Party as Harris seeks to solidify her position by selecting a running mate. Endorsements from influential figures like former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have bolstered her campaign, adding pressure to her upcoming decision. With an announcement expected by August 7, Harris and her team are meticulously vetting a range of potential candidates, each bringing unique strengths and challenges.\n\nHarris is currently vetting several prominent Democrats for the vice-presidential slot. The candidates under consideration include Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Recently, Michigan Senator Gary Peters' name has also surfaced. Each of these individuals brings unique strengths and challenges to the table, and Harris' choice will reflect her strategic priorities for the campaign.\n\nHarris faces the monumental task of securing victory in seven key swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. These states are crucial battlegrounds, and her choice of running mate will be scrutinized for its potential to sway voters in these regions.\n\nGovernor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania is a compelling candidate with strong credentials. However, his Jewish heritage could be a double-edged sword, particularly in Michigan, where a significant Arab and Muslim population might view his candidacy with skepticism due to concerns about his stance on Israel. Additionally, Shapiro's support for private school vouchers puts him at odds with public school advocates, which could further complicate his appeal.\n\nSenator Mark Kelly of Arizona is another strong contender, but his potential nomination comes with significant risks. Should Kelly be chosen, he would have to resign from the Senate, allowing the Republican governor of Arizona to appoint a Republican successor. This would tip the balance of power in the Senate, a critical consideration for the Democratic Party.\n\nGovernor Roy Cooper of North Carolina has already withdrawn from consideration, narrowing the field. His decision underscores the complexities and personal calculations involved in the vice-presidential selection process.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is a well-known figure with national recognition. However, his profile and policy positions may not necessarily complement Harris' strengths, raising questions about the overall balance of the ticket.\n\nSenator Gary Peters of Michigan brings a long family history and a solid legislative record. Despite his historical ties and past electoral success, his recent dip in popularity and the narrow margin of his 2020 Senate victory suggest he may not significantly enhance Harris' electoral prospects in key swing states.\n\nGovernor Andy Beshear of Kentucky is noted for his progressive stance on voting rights, having restored the voting rights of over 140,000 former felons. While this move aligns with liberal values, it also raises concerns about the integrity of the voting system, a point that could be exploited by opponents.\n\nGovernor Tim Walz of Minnesota offers limited strategic value in terms of electoral math. Minnesota has consistently voted Democratic since 1972, and there is no clear indication that Walz would bolster Harris' chances in neighboring swing states like Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\nOne of Harris' most significant challenges is finding a running mate who offers ideological balance without alienating the Democratic base or conservative-leaning voters. The current field of candidates largely shares Harris' liberal views on key issues such as abortion rights, marijuana legalization, and gun control. This ideological alignment, while reinforcing party unity, risks alienating moderate and conservative Democrats who may find Trump's platform more appealing.\n\nA notable gap among the potential running mates is the lack of substantial foreign policy and national security experience. In an election where global issues and international relations are likely to be prominent, this deficiency could be a critical weakness. Harris' campaign will need to address these concerns, possibly by emphasizing her own experience and strategic vision on the global stage.\n\nHarris' eventual running mate will have to face Republican VP nominee JD Vance in debates. Vance has proven to be a formidable debater, adept at putting Democrats on the defensive. The Democratic ticket will need a candidate who can effectively counter Vance's attacks and articulate a compelling vision for the future.\n\nThe broader dilemma for the Democratic Party is the balancing act between progressive ideals and broader electoral appeal. The party's shift towards more left-wing policies could energize the base but risks alienating moderate voters. Harris' selection of a running mate will signal the party's strategic direction and its approach to addressing this ideological divide.\n\nAs Harris deliberates her choice, the stakes are high. The selected vice presidential candidate must not only help win crucial swing states but also present a unified front capable of addressing the nation's diverse and complex issues. The decision is further complicated by the need to balance liberal policies with broader electoral appeal.\n\nKamala Harris's vice presidential selection process is a pivotal moment in her campaign. Each potential candidate brings distinct advantages and disadvantages, and the final choice will significantly impact the Democratic Party's chances in the 2024 presidential election. With the announcement deadline looming, all eyes are on Harris as she navigates this critical juncture in her political career."],"source":{"uri":["weeklyblitz.net"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Blitz"]},"authors":[{"uri":["jennifer_hicks@weeklyblitz.net"],"name":["Jennifer Hicks"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://weeklyblitz.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Harris-Navigates-Complex-Terrain-in-Vice-Presidential-Selection.jpg"],"eventUri":["eng-9788518"],"sentiment":[0.2314],"wgt":[460586295],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["2024-08-444968625"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-05"],"time":["20:33:22"],"dateTime":["2024-08-05T20:33:22Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-05T19:59:29Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.register-herald.com/news/nation_world/ap-news-summary-at-3-59-p-m-edt/article_3656d131-cd2d-52b3-babf-3292edb918d4.html"],"title":["AP News Summary at 3:59 p.m. EDT"],"body":["Dow drops 1,000, and Japanese stocks suffer worst crash since 1987 as markets quake around the world\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly everything on Wall Street is tumbling as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsens and sets off another sell-off for financial markets around the world. The S&P 500 sank 3.1% in late trading Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1,009 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.8%. That followed a 12.4% plunge for Japan's Nikkei 225, its worst day since 1987. Treasury yields pared their losses after a report showed U.S. services businesses are continuing to grow.

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby is slamming Florida with catastrophic flooding and could bring potentially record-setting rain to Georgia and South Carolina. The storm made landfall on the gulf coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 65 mph. More than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia. At least four storm-related deaths have been reported. Local leaders in coastal Georgia were preparing for high water in case Debby stalls out over cities like Savannah. An official in South Carolina says Debby could be a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event.\"\n\nBangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.\n\nRally dates are set. Venues are chosen. The only thing missing for Harris' blitz is her VP choice\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.\n\nKamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.\n\nSupreme Court shuts down Missouri's long shot push to lift Trump's gag order in hush-money case\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court has shut down a long-shot push from Missouri seeking to remove a gag order in former President Donald Trump's hush-money case and delay his sentencing in New York. The decision comes Monday after the Missouri attorney general had argued in the unusual request that the New York gag order wrongly limits what the GOP presidential nominee could say on the campaign trail and Trump's eventual sentence could affect his ability to travel. New York countered that the limited gag order does allow Trump to talk about the issues important to voters, and the sentence may not affect his movement at all.\n\nGoogle loses massive antitrust case over its search dominance\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. After reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\nHundreds in Israel mark the 5th birthday of a child held hostage in Gaza\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Hundreds of Israelis have sent orange balloons into the air to mark the fifth birthday of one of two children held captive by militants in the Gaza Strip. Ariel Bibas, who along with his 1-year-old brother Kfir, has become a symbol of the struggle to release the hostages. The orange balloons are meant to symbolize Ariel and Kfir's bright red hair. During its Oct. 7 attack, Hamas killed 1,200 people and took some 250 people hostage, according to Israeli authorities. Among the 110 still held hostage, the Bibas boys are said to be the only children.\n\nThis preschool in Alaska changed lives for parents and kids alike. Why did it have to close?\n\nWASILLA, Alaska (AP) -- In rural Alaska, the federally funded Head Start preschool program has helped parents earn college degrees. It has put parents with drug addictions on paths toward recovery and educated children who have ended up in foster care. And, of course, it has readied youngsters for kindergarten. So it was crushing when one of Alaska's Head Start providers closed two of its preschools. The program suffers nationally from a teacher shortage -- its teachers must have college degrees, and they can often earn more working in retail or at local school districts. The preschool closures in Alaska preview what other regions across the country could soon face.\n\nAt the Paris Olympics, it will no longer be personal for Ukraine's athletes. This time, it's war\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- For Ukrainian athletes, the Paris Olympics are more than just sports. They're a way to draw attention to their country's fight for survival against Russia -- a sort of war on another battlefield. But an Associated Press analysis found Russia's war is making it increasingly difficult for Ukraine, once a post-Soviet sports power, to get those headline-capturing medals. Ukrainian performances began dipping after 2014, the year of Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea. Ukraine's haul of 11 medals at the 2016 Rio Games was its smallest as an independent nation and it tumbled to a low of 22nd in the country rankings. Ukraine recovered to 16th at the pandemic-delayed Olympics in Tokyo in 2021 but just one of its 19 medals was gold -- another new low."],"source":{"uri":["register-herald.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Beckley Register-Herald"]},"authors":[{"uri":["associated_press@register-herald.com"],"name":["Associated Press"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/register-herald.com/content/tncms/custom/image/b87268c4-7873-11e7-af9a-f3a04545878a.jpg?resize=200%2C200"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[-0.3725],"wgt":[460586002],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8260706559"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-05"],"time":["20:31:53"],"dateTime":["2024-08-05T20:31:53Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-05T20:30:30Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.messenger-inquirer.com/ap/elections/venezuelas-opposition-calls-on-armed-forces-to-ditch-support-for-maduro-in-post-election-crisis/article_5af2a1a3-5c73-54ca-8e7c-62f62361dc46.html"],"title":["Venezuela's opposition calls on armed forces to ditch support for Maduro in post-election crisis"],"body":["A soldier carries chairs as election workers prepare polling stations in Caracas, Venezuela, Friday, July 26, 2024.

As Vice President Kamala Harris emerges as the presumptive nominee for the 2024 presidential election, a complex debate is unfolding within progressive circles. While the threat posed by Republican nominee Donald Trump's potential return to power looms large, some prominent progressives, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, are hesitating to offer their immediate and unconditional endorsement of Harris. This reluctance has sparked criticism from certain quarters, but a closer examination reveals that this measured approach may be both strategically sound and necessary for the long-term health of the progressive movement.\n\nBy resisting calls for unconditional loyalty to party nominees, progressives are advocating for a more dynamic, responsive political system where ideas and policies are vigorously debated, even within party lines.\n\nThe stakes of the 2024 election cannot be overstated. Trump's potential return to the White House is widely viewed as an existential threat to liberal democracy. His previous term was marked by attempts to undermine democratic institutions, a disregard for the rule of law, and the emboldening of far-right extremism. The prospect of a second Trump term, potentially unconstrained by reelection concerns, sends shivers down the spines of many Americans, regardless of their position on the political spectrum.\n\nGiven these high stakes, the impulse to rally behind any Democratic nominee might seem natural. However, such unconditional support could prove counterproductive and potentially damaging to the long-term promotion of a genuine progressive agenda. To understand this perspective, it's essential to examine the delicate balance of power within the Democratic Party and the role that progressive pressure has played in recent years.\n\nThe Biden administration's most celebrated achievements -- from ambitious climate initiatives to student debt relief to massive infrastructure investment -- owe much to the persistent pressure exerted by progressive forces both inside and outside the government. The creation of a strong progressive voting bloc, coupled with grassroots movements and the strategic positioning of left-wing officials in key roles, has been instrumental in pushing the Democratic agenda leftward. These victories were not gifts bestowed by a benevolent party establishment but hard-won concessions extracted through sustained activism and political maneuvering.\n\nThe obvious fear among progressives is that without this constant pressure, the Democratic Party will inevitably gravitate back toward its corporate-friendly, centrist tendencies. Historically, the Democratic Party has maintained close ties with corporate interests and the military-industrial complex. While the party has made strides in recent years to address issues like income inequality and universal healthcare, these efforts often fall far short of the transformative changes needed to address systemic problems.\n\nThe influence of wealthy donors and corporate lobbyists remains a significant concern for progressives. As Sen. Sanders has long pointed out, the replacement of Biden as the nominee could potentially open the floodgates for even greater donor influence over the party's agenda. This fear is not unfounded, as evidenced by growing pressures from certain donors to replace Lina Khan, the current head of the Federal Trade Commission, who has been a leading figure in challenging big tech monopolies.\n\nVice President Harris' political evolution provides a case study in the tensions between progressive ideals and mainstream Democratic politics. As a presidential candidate in 2020, Harris embraced several progressive positions, including banning fracking and significant police reform. However, as she transitions into her role as the presumptive nominee, there are signs of a shift toward more centrist stances. Harris has begun to distance herself from some of her previous progressive positions in order to \"bolster a more moderate image.\" This rightward drift is seen by many as an attempt to court moderate voters and assuage the concerns of corporate donors.\n\nInterestingly, the only area where Harris seems to be maintaining a somewhat progressive stance is on the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Here, she has called for a more balanced approach, aligning with growing pressure from Democratic voters who support Palestinian rights and are demanding a cease-fire. This shift in the party's stance on Israel-Palestine provides a telling example of how progressive pressure can influence party positions. Harris's more nuanced approach, where while reconfirming US support for Israel she has also openly critiqued the number of civilian casualties, stands in contrast to the traditionally staunch pro-Israel stance of the Democratic establishment.\n\nThe fact that Harris has not fully abandoned this more balanced position on Israel-Palestine, even as she moves to the center on other issues, demonstrates the power of sustained progressive advocacy. It also underscores the importance of maintaining pressure on key issues rather than offering blanket support. The growing chorus of Democratic voters, particularly young people and progressives, demanding a ceasefire and a reevaluation of U.S. support for Israeli military actions has clearly had an impact on the party's rhetoric and policy positions.\n\nThe reluctance of some progressives to offer immediate, unconditional endorsement to Harris is not merely about ideological purity. It's a calculated strategy aimed at shaping the Democratic platform and ensuring that progressive priorities remain at the forefront of the party's agenda. By making their support conditional on commitments to key progressive policies, leftist leaders hope to prevent a wholesale abandonment of the transformative vision that has energized millions of voters, particularly young people.\n\nThis approach serves several strategic purposes. By withholding immediate endorsement, progressives retain bargaining power to influence the party platform and Harris's campaign promises. A vigorous debate within the party can actually serve to engage and motivate progressive voters, rather than suppressing turnout through a perception that their concerns are being ignored. Conditional support encourages specific, measurable policy commitments rather than vague platitudes. Moreover, by clearly articulating their expectations now, progressives lay the groundwork for holding a potential Harris administration accountable after the election.\n\nWhile the threat posed by a potential Trump presidency is real and significant, offering unconditional support to any Democratic nominee carries its own set of risks. Without pressure from the left, there's a danger that the Democratic platform could shift even further to the center, abandoning key progressive priorities. Young and progressive voters, who have been crucial to recent Democratic victories, may become disillusioned if they perceive that their concerns are being sidelined. The transition period presents a unique opportunity to push for party reforms and policy commitments, and immediate, unconditional endorsement would squander this chance. Once full endorsement is given, progressives lose much of their leverage to influence the direction of the campaign and potential administration.\n\nThe progressive strategy of conditional support extends beyond mere party politics. It speaks to a broader vision of how democracy should function. By resisting calls for unconditional loyalty to party nominees, progressives are advocating for a more dynamic, responsive political system where ideas and policies are vigorously debated, even within party lines. This approach challenges the notion that party unity must come at the expense of ideological diversity and policy innovation. Instead, it posits that a healthy democracy requires constant negotiation and renegotiation of the social contract, with citizens and their representatives actively shaping the direction of governance.\n\nAs the 2024 election approaches, progressives find themselves walking a tightrope. On one side looms the very real threat of a Trump return to power, with all the democratic backsliding that would entail. On the other side is the risk of seeing hard-won progressive gains eroded by a Democratic Party that, absent continued pressure, may revert to its more corporate-friendly instincts. Withholding immediate, unconditional endorsement of Kamala Harris is not a rejection of the democratic process or an invitation for Trump to win. Rather, it's a sophisticated political strategy aimed at ensuring that the Democratic Party remains responsive to the needs and aspirations of its progressive base. In the end, the progressive movement's strength lies in its ability to both challenge and support the Democratic Party, pushing it toward a more equitable, sustainable, and just vision for America. By maintaining this tension, progressives hope to not just win an election, but to fundamentally transform the political landscape for generations to come.\n\nUltimately, while the strategy of conditional support for Democratic candidates like Kamala Harris serves immediate tactical purposes, it's crucial to recognize that true transformative change ultimately requires building an independent, mass progressive movement. This movement can strategically align with pro-corporate parties like the Democrats when necessary in the short term, but its long-term goal must be to fundamentally reshape the political landscape. By organizing outside traditional party structures, building grassroots power, and cultivating a clear vision for a more egalitarian, sustainable, and free world, progressives can work toward creating a political force that doesn't just influence existing parties, but eventually replaces them with something far better."],"source":{"uri":["scheerpost.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["scheerpost.com"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://i0.wp.com/scheerpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/52650423047_92eca2d4ea_o-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C1200&ssl=1&w=640"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[-0.0118],"wgt":[460585618],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["2024-08-444960920"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-05"],"time":["20:20:18"],"dateTime":["2024-08-05T20:20:18Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-05T19:09:14Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.6235],"url":["https://internewscast.com/news/us/update-harris-nears-decision-on-running-mate-selection-during-crucial-week/"],"title":["Update: Harris nears decision on running mate selection during crucial week - Internewscast Journal"],"body":["Vice President Kamala Harris, grappling with how to keep early 2024 Presidential election momentum alive, is also preparing for a crucial week that includes her most critical decision yet: choosing a running mate.\n\nWhile Harris has secured enough delegates to become the Democratic nominee, delegates still have to participate in a \"virtual roll call\" to solidify her nomination.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a Tuesday night deadline.

Harris Presidential Debate Dilemma Solved? Media Outlet Pitches 'Alternative That Would Satisfy Both Candidates' - Nexstar Media Gr (NASDAQ:NXST)"],"body":["A smaller media outlet is proposing to be the middle man with a debate between the two candidates.\n\nPlans for an upcoming presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have hit a roadblock ahead of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nEach candidate is currently ready to debate at rival events, with a media company proposing a solution to get both candidates together.\n\nWhat Happened: The first 2024 presidential debate between Trump and President Joe Biden may have been one of the biggest turning points in the 2024 election, with Biden later dropping out of the race.\n\nThe debate was watched by 47.9 million people and set records for Warner Bros. Discovery WBD unit CNN, while also bringing in less viewers than the first presidential debates of 2016 and 2020.\n\nBiden and Trump originally agreed on a second debate set for Sept. 10 on ABC News, a unit of The Walt Disney Company DIS. Fox Corporation FOXFOXA has also proposed hosting a debate on Sept. 17.\n\nNewsNation, which is a unit of Nexstar Media Group NXST, has proposed a debate for Trump and Harris with letters sent to the two presidential candidates' teams.\n\n\"I'd like to offer an alternative that would satisfy both candidates - not to mention the American people - a fair, respectful and even-handed debate on NewsNation, co-sponsored by The Hill,\" Nexstar executive Sean Compton said in the letter, as reported by Variety.\n\nNexstar also owns The Hill, a political news media outlet.\n\n\"We of course are flexible on the timing, format and location of the debate, although we certainly expect it would be held in a battleground state such as Pennsylvania.\"\n\nNewsNation, launched in 2001, is smaller than other media outlets that have hosted presidential debates. The outlet has attempted to be non-partisan and an alternative to media outlets that are often partisan.\n\n\"Unlike some media outlets, they are not identified as favoring either Democrats or Republicans. That's why NewsNation and The Hill are the perfect platform for an intelligent conversation about the crucial issues facing America as we head into the election.\"\n\nHarris has said she will be appearing at the previously agreed upon Sept. 10 debate with ABC News. Trump is proposing a Fox News hosted debate on Sept. 4, calling the Sept. 10 debate cancelled since Biden dropped out and due to his ongoing litigation against the media network.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nCongress Is Making Huge Investments.

The former president is also pushing to make sure there is a live studio audience for a debate with Harris, something that was not part of his first debate with Biden.\n\nHarris has pushed back against Trump's claim that he is willing to debate \"any time, any place\" in her recent comments about the presidential debates.\n\n\"Donald, I do hope you'll reconsider meeting me on the debate stage,\" Harris recently said. \"If you've got something to say, say it to my face.\"\n\nNewsNation hosted the fourth Republican debate during the 2024 election, which was skipped by Trump. The debate had around 4.1 million viewers for NewsNation.\n\nUnlike past debates that were not exclusive to one media network, media companies are now fighting to land the rights to be the home of debates.\n\nCNN was the lucky winner of the rights to the first debate, but also allowed simulcasting of the event, which benefitted Fox, who had strong viewership.\n\nWith the 2024 election nearly three months away, voters may be excited about the notion of Trump and Harris facing off head-to-head in a debate for the first time.\n\nWith or without the debate, Nexstar is viewed as a potential winner among media stocks with increased spending during the 2024 election as the owner of America's largest local broadcasting network with 200 owned or partner stations in 116 U.S. markets.\n\nCheck This Out:\n\nLawmakers Made Huge Investments This Year.

The bogus ballot deadline information from the chatbot also referenced Alabama, Indiana, Ohio and Texas, although their secretaries of state did not sign the letter. Grok continued to repeat the false information for 10 days before it was corrected, the secretaries said.\n\nThe letter urged X to immediately fix the chatbot \"to ensure voters have accurate information in this critical election year.\" That would include directing Grok to send users to CanIVote.org, a voting information website run by the National Association of Secretaries of State, when asked about U.S. elections.\n\nWho heads up Project 2025?\n\nA chief architect of Project 2025 -- the controversial conservative blueprint to remake the federal government -- Russell Vought is likely to be appointed to a high-ranking post in a second Donald Trump administration.

Now, he's being mentioned as a candidate to be Trump's White House chief of staff, one of the most powerful positions in government.\n\nLed by the Heritage Foundation, Project 2025 is a detailed 920-page handbook for governing under the next Republican administration.

Google's counsel acknowledged an \"error\" to the committee that showed results for Harris instead of Trump and omitted information about Trump entirely in response to the search \"President Donald,\" claiming it was due to a \"bug.\"\n\nGoogle users began flagging the search result discrepancies in late July when the autocomplete feature for \"assassination attempt\" omitted any information regarding the recent Trump shooting.

The committee said this was a \"vague excuse\" that left \"many questions unanswered.\"\n\nThe committee also questioned Pichai about why Google searches for Trump had produced search results and news stories relating to Vice President Kamala Harris. Alphabet had claimed that this \"error\" was the \"result of its algorithm\" that is programmed to automatically generate news topics \"related to a Google Search inquiry,\" according to the letter.\n\n\"The company also noted that 'predictions may be unexpected or imperfect, and bugs will occur,'\" the report reads.\n\nSince news of the apparent discrepancy first broke, various Republican lawmakers, including Sen.

Ukraine recovered to 16th at the pandemic-delayed Olympics in Tokyo in 2021 but just one of its 19 medals was gold -- another new low.\n\nMore from this section\n\nMCT Reports a 6% Mortgage Lock Volume Decrease in Latest Report\n\nReformed Gangster Disciples Boss, Harold 'Noonie G' Ward Hosts Citywide Voter Registration Drive During the DNC in Support of VP Kamala Harris\n\nGoogle loses massive antitrust case over its search dominance"],"source":{"uri":["kulr8.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["KULR-8 Local News"]},"authors":[{"uri":["associated_press@kulr8.com"],"name":["Associated Press"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kulr8.com/content/tncms/custom/image/ebec0578-57d0-11ee-978f-b7da313020af.jpg?resize=600%2C315"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[-0.1059],"wgt":[460584294],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8260674230"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-05"],"time":["20:04:38"],"dateTime":["2024-08-05T20:04:38Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-05T19:59:22Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.yahoo.com/news/virginia-man-charged-threatening-burn-194900577.html"],"title":["Virginia man charged with threatening to burn Kamala Harris alive"],"body":["A 66-year-old Virginia man is charged with threatening to burn Vice President Kamala Harris alive to see her suffer.\n\nA prosecutor for the Western District of Virginia said Frank Lucio Carillo was in court Monday for a preliminary hearing over death threats he made against the vice president, who's also the Democratic party's nominee for president in November.\n\nUsing the name \"joemadarats1\" on his GETTER social media account, Carillo mentioned Harris nearly 20 times, prosecutors said.

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby is slamming Florida with catastrophic flooding and could bring potentially record-setting rain to Georgia and South Carolina. The storm made landfall on the gulf coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 65 mph. More than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia. At least four storm-related deaths have been reported. Local leaders in coastal Georgia were preparing for high water in case Debby stalls out over cities like Savannah. An official in South Carolina says Debby could be a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event.\"\n\nBangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.\n\nDow drops 1,000, and Japanese stocks suffer worst crash since 1987 as markets quake around the world\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly everything on Wall Street is tumbling as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsens and sets off another sell-off for financial markets around the world. The S&P 500 sank 3.1% in late trading Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1,009 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.8%. That followed a 12.4% plunge for Japan's Nikkei 225, its worst day since 1987. Treasury yields pared their losses after a report showed U.S. services businesses are continuing to grow. But worries are still high after a report on Friday showed U.S. employers pulled back on hiring last month by more than expected.\n\nRally dates are set. Venues are chosen. The only thing missing for Harris' blitz is her VP choice\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.\n\nKamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.\n\nSupreme Court shuts down Missouri's long shot push to lift Trump's gag order in hush-money case\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court has shut down a long-shot push from Missouri seeking to remove a gag order in former President Donald Trump's hush-money case and delay his sentencing in New York. The decision comes Monday after the Missouri attorney general had argued in the unusual request that the New York gag order wrongly limits what the GOP presidential nominee could say on the campaign trail and Trump's eventual sentence could affect his ability to travel. New York countered that the limited gag order does allow Trump to talk about the issues important to voters, and the sentence may not affect his movement at all.\n\nGoogle loses massive antitrust case over its search dominance\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. After reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\nHundreds in Israel mark the 5th birthday of a child held hostage in Gaza\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Hundreds of Israelis have sent orange balloons into the air to mark the fifth birthday of one of two children held captive by militants in the Gaza Strip. Ariel Bibas, who along with his 1-year-old brother Kfir, has become a symbol of the struggle to release the hostages. The orange balloons are meant to symbolize Ariel and Kfir's bright red hair. During its Oct. 7 attack, Hamas killed 1,200 people and took some 250 people hostage, according to Israeli authorities. Among the 110 still held hostage, the Bibas boys are said to be the only children.\n\nThis preschool in Alaska changed lives for parents and kids alike. Why did it have to close?\n\nWASILLA, Alaska (AP) -- In rural Alaska, the federally funded Head Start preschool program has helped parents earn college degrees. It has put parents with drug addictions on paths toward recovery and educated children who have ended up in foster care. And, of course, it has readied youngsters for kindergarten. So it was crushing when one of Alaska's Head Start providers closed two of its preschools. The program suffers nationally from a teacher shortage -- its teachers must have college degrees, and they can often earn more working in retail or at local school districts. The preschool closures in Alaska preview what other regions across the country could soon face.\n\nAt the Paris Olympics, it will no longer be personal for Ukraine's athletes. This time, it's war\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- For Ukrainian athletes, the Paris Olympics are more than just sports. They're a way to draw attention to their country's fight for survival against Russia -- a sort of war on another battlefield. But an Associated Press analysis found Russia's war is making it increasingly difficult for Ukraine, once a post-Soviet sports power, to get those headline-capturing medals. Ukrainian performances began dipping after 2014, the year of Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea. Ukraine's haul of 11 medals at the 2016 Rio Games was its smallest as an independent nation and it tumbled to a low of 22nd in the country rankings. Ukraine recovered to 16th at the pandemic-delayed Olympics in Tokyo in 2021 but just one of its 19 medals was gold -- another new low."],"source":{"uri":["wsiltv.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["WSIL"]},"authors":[{"uri":["associated_press@wsiltv.com"],"name":["Associated Press"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[true]}],"image":{},"eventUri":["eng-9792913"],"sentiment":[-0.1059],"wgt":[460583890],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["2024-08-444943413"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-05"],"time":["19:56:33"],"dateTime":["2024-08-05T19:56:33Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-05T19:39:23Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://exbulletin.com/politics/2812666/"],"title":["Harris vs. Trump: New poll shows 7-point difference in presidential race"],"body":["A University of Massachusetts Amherst poll, conducted between July 29 and August 1, showed a 7-point swing in the presidential race since the last time the poll was conducted in January.\n\nThe poll went from a 4-point lead for former President Donald Trump over President Joe Biden to a 3-point lead for Vice President Kamala Harris over Trump.\n\nThe poll found that 43% of respondents planned to vote or were inclined to vote for Trump, the same percentage who answered the question that way in January.\n\nHowever, while 39% of respondents said in January that they planned to vote for Biden, or were inclined to vote for him, the recent poll showed that 46% planned or were inclined to vote for Harris.\n\nCandidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. received 6 percent of the vote in the latest poll, down from 9 percent in January.\n\nThe poll, conducted in partnership with WCVB-TV, involved interviews with a sample of 1,000 people nationwide and has a margin of error of 3.8 percent.\n\nThe presidential race was disrupted last month by two major events: an assassination attempt on Trump and Biden's withdrawal from the race after extreme pressure from his party.\n\nHarris was able to quickly win support from party leaders, members of Congress and delegates to the Democratic National Convention, who will vote this month to confirm the nomination.\n\nThe UMass poll is the latest sign that Harris has shifted the race in Democrats' favor since becoming the likely nominee.\n\nHarris' arrival has really shaken up the presidential race, Jesse Rhodes, a UMass Amherst political science professor and co-director of the poll, said in a press release. Whereas Donald Trump was once a clear favorite over Joe Biden, we now see Harris with a slight lead. This appears to be due to big shifts among young voters, African Americans and Latinos in favor of Harris. Moderates also appear to have shifted dramatically in favor of Harris. The 2024 presidential election is still extremely close, but it's an entirely different race than it was a month ago.\n\nOf those who said they would vote for Harris, 66% cited as their main reason that she represents a new generation. The next most common response, at 37%, was that she would strengthen America's global standing.\n\nAmong those who chose Trump, 75% cited his accomplishments in his first term as the main reason they would vote for him, followed by \"He will save America\" at 48%.\n\nThe poll also looked at voter enthusiasm since Harris joined the race. Among Democratic respondents, 66% said they were much more enthusiastic or somewhat more enthusiastic since Harris replaced Biden at the top of the ticket.\n\nAmong Republicans, 37% said they were either much more enthusiastic or somewhat more enthusiastic.\n\nKamala Harris improved her standing in Biden's primary race across virtually every demographic subset, including a 17% gain among independents and a notable 14 percentage point increase among young voters, Alexander Theodoridis, co-director of the poll and an associate professor of political science at UMass, said in a statement. The three months until Election Day may feel like an eternity in political time, and the final weeks should remind us how quickly fortunes can turn, but Harris and the Democrats are at a major turning point.\n\nRespondents largely agree on one point regarding the importance of the election. Of all respondents, 89% rated the results of the 2024 election as very important or extremely important.\n\nView the full survey results here.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 24, 2020, / Compare-autoinsurance.Org has launched a new blog post that presents the main benefits of comparing multiple car insurance quotes.

It was inspiring. It was galvanizing,\" said TaRessa Stovall, a Mount Laurel writer and one of the 44,000 people on the historic Win With Black Women call, kicking off the virtual fundraising trend Harris' possible ascension to the presidency ignited. \"It was like church, a full tent revival, and pep rally all at once. There was an immediate sense of community.\"\n\nJust when we thought we were over Zoom, the meeting app has come into its own as an indispensable political tool. Fascinating, yes. But not far-fetched, as social media and easy-to-use apps continue to shape how we protest, politic, and advocate.\n\nGalvanizing support for candidates is as old as politics itself, said Sergei Kostiaev, assistant professor of political science at Drexel University. Politicians are and always will be searching for effective ways to talk about themselves, the issues, and prove their opponents wrong, he said. \"The nature of politics doesn't change, it's how we mobilize and communicate that changes, Kostiaev added. \"Zoom is the latest tool.\"\n\nThanks to the pandemic, most of us are well-versed with Zoom. We know how to have side convos in the chat and how to turn off the camera for bathroom breaks. Organizing Zooms can take less than a minute and hopping on one, seconds. We have Zoom in the background while washing dishes and tucking in the kids. And it's a lot easier to show up to a virtual event and make a donation than find a babysitter, get gussied up in sparkles and heels, and make said donation. \"People don't have to leave their house and they still feel like they were in the political trenches,\" Kostiaev said. \"It provides access, satisfaction, and convenience.\"\n\nZoom's impact on Harris' race has been astounding. Win With Black Women raised $1.5 million on its first VP Harris for President call. Fifty-three thousand Black men raised $1.3 million on Zoom the following evening. That same week, 160,000 white women met on Zoom and raised $8.5 million and to Fox Network's chagrin, 180,000 White Dudes for Harris, raised $4 million. Cat Ladies for Kamala hosted a Zoom Call To Action Sunday evening, and according to Instagram, raised $320,000 by the end of the call.\n\nHarris secured enough votes Friday from Democratic delegates to officially be named the party's nominee for president and her campaign raised $310 million in July, more than double what the Trump campaign raised. In less than two weeks, political pundits say, Harris has reset the race, up by 1 point in the polls.\n\nNow, we need this Zoom momentum to translate into votes.\n\n\" READ MORE: I'm not interested in your Kamala Harris memes. I just want you to vote.\n\nThose of us tired of Trump and vice-presidential nominee, JD Vance, talking to Black people, Latinos, Asians, Jewish folks -- heck, women who don't have children -- as if we are not American, nor do we deserve to be, are turning to Zoom not just to raise money, but to vent. We are finding two truths: we are not alone and there is strength in numbers.\n\nJotaka Eaddy, founded Win With Black Women during the 2020 presidential election to support then vice presidential candidate, Harris.

Joyce Beatty, scheduled to appear on the July 21 evening's night Zoom, mentioned the Zoom on MSNBC and by the end of the night Black women were getting text alerts to come to the meeting -- I got at least five, and was one of the many women who tried but couldn't access the call.\n\nIf we wanted to save democracy, we had to get busy.\n\n\"The Right has worked really hard to redefine this concept of identity politics as something bad,\" said Sarah J. Jackson, an associate professor in the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication and expert on Black and feminist media and activism. \"The truth is affinity groups are all invested in the same project of saving democracy this election. This is something that's kind of beautiful, something that a functional multiracial democracy should look like.\"\n\nTrump will continue to run his ugly divide and conquer plays. He will continue to say untrue things about people of color -- like suggesting there is such a thing as Black jobs -- to unite his racist followers. Last week Trump stooped to a new low, questioning Harris' Blackness at the National Association of Black Journalists Convention in Chicago, never mind Harris attended Howard University, an HBCU, and pledged Alpha Kappa Alpha, the country's oldest Black sorority. Never mind Harris, whose mother is Indian and father is Jamaican, has always identified as a proud, Black woman -- her late 1980s Salt-N-Pepa asymmetrical cut speaks Gen X Black woman volumes.\n\nIn addition to creating safe spaces for affinity groups, Zoom is creating a platform for our allies and accomplices to speak, raise money, and speak out in large numbers. During the \"White Woman: Answer the Call! Show up for Kamala Harris\" call, white women admitted to failing when they did not vote for Hillary Clinton, pledging to elect -- and make other White women elect -- the first woman of color as president. Now they know their reproductive rights and those of their children depend on it. White Dudes for Harris double down on the idea that Trump doesn't speak for all white men, proving the must vulnerable of us have more allies than we realized.\n\nThat warms my heart more than the millions of dollars raised for Harris' campaign.\n\nHarris sloughed Trump's comments as his same old show of \"divisiveness and disrespect\" in her response to Trump's NABJ tirade.\" We deserve a leader who understands that our differences to not divide us -- they are an essential source of our strength,\" Harris said.\n\nMAGA Republicans are counting on a divided America will distract us so much Trump can easily slide into a second presidency. Harris' candidacy is giving us a shot at saving our democracy, one Zoom call at a time."],"source":{"uri":["inquirer.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["The Philadelphia Inquirer"]},"authors":[{"uri":["elizabeth_wellington@inquirer.com"],"name":["Elizabeth Wellington"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/pTtj050h08-gb0PZrrhM2CBsg9Y=/760x507/smart/filters:format(webp)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/pmn/F6CJZRIIB2KLZRCULVBBYWUEMA.jpg"],"eventUri":["eng-9788867"],"sentiment":[0.302],"wgt":[460583659],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8260664004"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-05"],"time":["19:52:48"],"dateTime":["2024-08-05T19:52:48Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-05T19:49:05Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.6471],"url":["https://www.yahoo.com/news/virginia-man-charged-threatening-burn-191300444.html"],"title":["Virginia man charged with threatening to burn Kamala Harris alive"],"body":["A 66-year-old Virginia man is charged with threatening to burn Vice President Kamala Harris alive to see her suffer.\n\nA prosecutor for the Western District of Virginia said Frank Lucio Carillo was in court Monday for a preliminary hearing over death threats he made against the vice president, who's also the Democratic party's nominee for president in November.\n\nUsing the name \"joemadarats1\" on his GETTER social media account, Carillo mentioned Harris nearly 20 times, prosecutors said.

The storm made landfall on the gulf coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 65 mph. More than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia. At least four storm-related deaths have been reported.

Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change.

The S&P 500 sank 3.1% in late trading Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1,009 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.8%. That followed a 12.4% plunge for Japan's Nikkei 225, its worst day since 1987. Treasury yields pared their losses after a report showed U.S. services businesses are continuing to grow. But worries are still high after a report on Friday showed U.S. employers pulled back on hiring last month by more than expected.\n\nRally dates are set. Venues are chosen.

The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.\n\nKamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.\n\nUK prime minister talks of 'standing army' of police to deal with rioting across Britain\n\nLONDON (AP) -- British Prime Minister Keir Starmer says a \"standing army\" of specialist police will be set up to deal with rioting and the justice system will be ramped up to deal with hundreds of arrests after violent disorder rocked cities across the nation over the past week. Starmer has held an urgent meeting with ministers and top law enforcement officials as he seeks to end violence and attacks on immigrants, mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers. Starmer has called such attacks far-right thuggery. Misinformation spread online has whipped up anger over a stabbing rampage at a dance class that left three girls dead and many more wounded.\n\nHundreds in Israel mark the 5th birthday of a child held hostage in Gaza\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Hundreds of Israelis have sent orange balloons into the air to mark the fifth birthday of one of two children held captive by militants in the Gaza Strip. Ariel Bibas, who along with his 1-year-old brother Kfir, has become a symbol of the struggle to release the hostages. The orange balloons are meant to symbolize Ariel and Kfir's bright red hair. During its Oct. 7 attack, Hamas killed 1,200 people and took some 250 people hostage, according to Israeli authorities. Among the 110 still held hostage, the Bibas boys are said to be the only children.\n\nThis preschool in Alaska changed lives for parents and kids alike. Why did it have to close?\n\nWASILLA, Alaska (AP) -- In rural Alaska, the federally funded Head Start preschool program has helped parents earn college degrees. It has put parents with drug addictions on paths toward recovery and educated children who have ended up in foster care. And, of course, it has readied youngsters for kindergarten. So it was crushing when one of Alaska's Head Start providers closed two of its preschools. The program suffers nationally from a teacher shortage -- its teachers must have college degrees, and they can often earn more working in retail or at local school districts. The preschool closures in Alaska preview what other regions across the country could soon face.\n\nAt the Paris Olympics, it will no longer be personal for Ukraine's athletes. This time, it's war\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- For Ukrainian athletes, the Paris Olympics are more than just sports. They're a way to draw attention to their country's fight for survival against Russia -- a sort of war on another battlefield. But an Associated Press analysis found Russia's war is making it increasingly difficult for Ukraine, once a post-Soviet sports power, to get those headline-capturing medals. Ukrainian performances began dipping after 2014, the year of Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea. Ukraine's haul of 11 medals at the 2016 Rio Games was its smallest as an independent nation and it tumbled to a low of 22nd in the country rankings. Ukraine recovered to 16th at the pandemic-delayed Olympics in Tokyo in 2021 but just one of its 19 medals was gold -- another new low.\n\nFor female athletes of color, scrutiny around gender rules and identity is part of a long trend\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Female athletes of color have historically faced disproportionate scrutiny and discrimination when it comes to sex testing and false accusations that they are male or transgender. Algerian boxer Imane Khelif and Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-Ting are the latest examples of women of color who have found themselves caught in a contentious debate around gender regulations and perceptions in sports. Historians and anthropologists say international sporting federations don't tend to promote an understanding of diversity in sex and gender identity. They note that gender tests have often targeted female athletes of color who don't conform to typically Western, white ideals of femininity."],"source":{"uri":["register-herald.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Beckley Register-Herald"]},"authors":[{"uri":["associated_press@register-herald.com"],"name":["Associated Press"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/register-herald.com/content/tncms/custom/image/b87268c4-7873-11e7-af9a-f3a04545878a.jpg?resize=200%2C200"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[-0.1059],"wgt":[460582784],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["2024-08-444929486"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-05"],"time":["19:35:29"],"dateTime":["2024-08-05T19:35:29Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-05T19:13:24Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.6392],"url":["https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/08/05/kamala-harris-death-threat-burn-alive-virginia-man-charged/"],"title":["Virginia man charged with threatening to burn Kamala Harris alive"],"body":["A 66-year-old Virginia man is charged with threatening to burn Vice President Kamala Harris alive to see her suffer.\n\nA prosecutor for the Western District of Virginia said Frank Lucio Carillo was in court Monday for a preliminary hearing over death threats he made against the vice president, who's also the Democratic party's nominee for president in November.\n\nUsing the name \"joemadarats1\" on his GETTER social media account, Carillo mentioned Harris nearly 20 times, prosecutors said.

Kennedy Jr. appeared in a New York court on Monday to fight a residency challenge as he seeks to get on the state's ballot as an independent candidate for the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe Associated Press (AP) reported that Kennedy appeared in a civil court in Albany, New York, to fight against a lawsuit that alleges he falsely claimed New York as his residence. According to state election law, the presiding judge will decide the case without a jury.\n\nThe lawsuit contends that Kennedy's nominating petition falsely claimed his residence was in New York City's northern suburbs while he has actually been living in Los Angeles since his 2014 marriage to Curb Your Enthusiasm star Cheryl Hines.\n\nThe AP reported that the case against Kennedy was brought by Clear Choice PAC, a group formed earlier this year by allies of President Joe Biden.\n\nDuring the trial on Monday, a Kennedy friend named David Michaelis took the stand and testified Kennedy was a frequent guest at his home in Westchester County from 2014 to 2017. According to the AP, Michaelis received a document while testifying which showed Kennedy said that Michaelis had asked him to move out of his house in March 2023 over his support for Biden.\n\nHowever, Michaelis called the statement \"fiction\" and said Kennedy never lived in his home.\n\nIn his New York ballot petition, Kennedy lists his residence in the state as a home belonging to a different friend in Katonah, a wealthy suburb in Westchester County. Kennedy claims he moved there after being asked to vacate Michaelis' residence.\n\nHowever, the lawsuit argues that Kennedy \"has no meaningful or continuous connections to the property\" in Katonah and has spent \"vanishingly little time, if any,\" at the location.\n\n\"Moreover, the evidence will show that Kennedy's wife and children live in California, along with his three dogs, two ravens, an emu and his personal belongings,\" the lawsuit says, according to the AP.\n\nIn a Monday statement, Kennedy's attorney, William F. Savino of Woods Oviatt Gilman, said: \"The home at 84 Croton Lake Road in Katonah, New York, is Mr. Kennedy's official address.\"\n\n\"He receives mail there. His driver's license and automobile are registered there. His voting registration, and fishing, and falconry licenses are from New York. His law office is in New York. He pays taxes to New York State,\" Savino said in the statement. \"New York has been his residence continuously since 1964, and Mr. Kennedy has deep ties to it. He even keeps his beloved falcons in New York State. He has never claimed any other state as a residency. He intends to move back to New York as soon as his wife retires from acting.\"\n\nEarlier on Monday, Kennedy made headlines after sharing a video on X (formerly Twitter) in which he said that he was behind the dumping of a dead bear cub in New York's Central Park.\n\nThe story originally made headlines in 2014 when a woman found the dead cub while walking her dog. On Sunday, Kennedy shed new light on the case, admitting it was he who left the cub there. He gave an account of the events in a video posted to X, ahead of an upcoming article in The New Yorker that he said was going to break the story.\n\nNewsweek was directed to the statement from Savino after reaching out to Kennedy's campaign via email for comment."],"source":{"uri":["newsweek.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Newsweek"]},"authors":[{"uri":["matthew_impelli@newsweek.com"],"name":["Matthew Impelli"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2443256/robert-f-kennedy-jr.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=a0975c04a019b9eebe1e82a58f225031"],"eventUri":["eng-9792172"],"sentiment":[0.1373],"wgt":[460582502],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8260649010"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-05"],"time":["19:34:42"],"dateTime":["2024-08-05T19:34:42Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-05T19:34:03Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.christianpost.com/news/womens-group-urges-harris-not-to-pick-shapiro-as-running-mate.html"],"title":["Women's group opposes Shapiro as Kamala's VP pick over handling of sexual harassment claim"],"body":["A women's group is calling on Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democrat nominee in the 2024 presidential election, not to pick Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as her running mate due to concerns about how he handled sexual assault claims that emerged in his office.\n\nHarris is expected to reveal her vice presidential pick no later than Tuesday. Shapiro is widely seen as one of the frontrunners to secure a place on the Democrats' presidential ticket.\n\nThe National Women's Defense League, which describes itself as \"a nonpartisan organization dedicated to preventing sexual harassment and protecting survivors,\" released a statement on Facebook last week expressing concern about the possibility that Harris might pick Shapiro.\n\n\"The American people deserve to know that if called to a higher office, Governor Josh Shapiro will do more to ensure the safety and dignity of employees, volunteers and constituents in his office,\" the NWDL stated. \"As the Harris campaign and the Democratic Party consider their options for vice presidential candidates, we urge them to consider the handling of past complaints of sexual harassment inside the Pennsylvania governor's office.\"\n\nThe NWDL specifically brought up \"sexual harassment happening in [Shapiro's] own office by Cabinet Secretary Mike Vereb,\" asserting that the office \"should have done a better job preventing\" it from happening in the first place.\n\nExamples of actions it wished Shapiro's office would have taken include \"protecting the survivor who bravely came forward, ensuring that any other potential survivors felt safe in speaking up, and ensuring that the harasser didn't have the opportunity to do further harm after the complaint.\"\n\n\"Our research indicates that there is rarely only one survivor in cases like this one,\" the group added. \"When it comes to sexual harassment, silence is not golden -- it's a red flag. Often, it indicates that others may not feel safe or supported in coming forward with their truth. NWDL acknowledges potential silent survivors and we stand with those who choose not to share their experiences publicly.\"\n\nAccording to the group, \"[s]exual harassment is especially rampant in our government and political workspaces, and we need leaders who will buck the pernicious status quo.\"\n\n\"We deserve leaders who will not brush sexual harassment under the rug, but will put accountability above politics. We need leaders who prioritize effective policies, protocols and culture that prevents sexual harassment and protects survivors,\" they added.\n\nThe subject of the sexual harassment complaint, Mike Vereb, served as secretary of legislative affairs from the start of the Shapiro administration in early 2023 until late September of that year.\n\nA statement from the governor's office from last September announced that Vereb was resigning and praised the Republican former state representative for \"six years securing funding for law enforcement and enhancing school safety in the Office of Attorney General and the critical first year of our Administration getting a historic, bipartisan budget across the finish line.\"\n\nShapiro's Chief of Staff Dana Fritz described Vereb as \"a key member of our team,\" adding that they \"wish Mike all the best and we're grateful for his service.\" The statement did not mention any sexual harassment allegations against Vereb.\n\nA report from Spotlight PA details how an unnamed former staffer filed a complaint in May 2023 alleging that Vereb had made inappropriate, lewd and sexually suggestive comments to her and that the state retaliated against her when she raised questions about his image. Subsequent reporting reveals that the governor's office released a settlement of $295,000 with the survivor that also requires staff to undergo sexual harassment training.\n\nThe governor's office has a policy in place requiring that the Equal Opportunity Officer of a particular agency where alleged acts of sexual harassment may have occurred to conduct an investigation after receiving a complaint that includes interviews with the complainant, alleged offender and any witnesses. Implemented in 2012, the policy predates Shapiro's tenure as governor.\n\nShapiro is seen as an attractive contender for the vice presidential nomination because he is governor of a critical swing state that has 19 electoral votes. The RealClearPolitics average of polls taken of Pennsylvania voters shows Harris trailing former President Donald Trump, her Republican opponent, by 1.8 percentage points.\n\nHowever, criticism of Shapiro extends beyond concerns about his office's handling of the sexual assault claim. Michael Moore, a progressive filmmaker and activist, has warned that Harris' selection of Shapiro, an observant Jew and a strong supporter of Israel, could cost her support in the swing state of Michigan. In a Substack post published last week, Moore complained that \"Shapiro said it's 'antisemitic' for anyone to join the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel.\"\n\nMoore identified Shapiro's position on Israel as well as his comments about college students protesting as behaviors that will \"diminish the Arab American vote for Harris and depress a large swath of the youth vote throughout the country,\" noting that \"Michigan has one of the largest Arab American populations in the nation.\"\n\nMichigan has 15 electoral college votes and the RealClearPolitics average of polls taken there shows Harris leading Trump by 2 percentage points."],"source":{"uri":["christianpost.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["The Christian Post"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/original/thumbnail/26/07/260745.jpg"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[-0.051],"wgt":[460582482],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8260645831"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-05"],"time":["19:31:51"],"dateTime":["2024-08-05T19:31:51Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-05T19:31:02Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.6078],"url":["https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-adin-ross-stream-jake-paul-gen-z.html"],"title":["Donald Trump Is Hot for the Gen-Z Streamers and Podcasters"],"body":["Adin Ross is not a name one might expect to come up in a conversation about the 2024 presidential election. Ross, 23, is a Twitch streamer who first became famous for playing NBA 2K online with LeBron James's son before he was banned from the platform after a repeated use of slurs. As he has grown into his fame, the Gen-Z streamer has grown more conservative, hanging out with Andrew Tate and hosting white supremacist Nick Fuentes on his stream.\n\nThis is the platform that Donald Trump chose for his first media hit of the week. On the livestreaming service Kick, where Ross has hosted his stream since being removed from Twitch, Trump walked out to 50 Cent's \"Many Men\" as a small audience applauded in a room in Mar-a-Lago where the cameras were set up. \"Do you know what livestreaming is?\" Ross asked Trump.\n\n\"More or less,\" Trump answered. \"It's the new wave.\" In the hour-plus interview, Trump went through his usual stream-of-consciousness stump speech. Ross, a little over his head, was unable to contribute to the conversation beyond lines like, \"That's really sad to think about\" or \"Damn, that's crazy to think about.\" Trump did manage to direct a few lines to the young audience tuning in. \"Youth tends to be Democrat,\" he said, but unlike past elections, the country \"can't wait 50 years\" for this demographic shift. \"Make the move now, all of you young people,\" he said to the 450,000 people tuned in. Ross, feeling generous, gave Trump a Rolex and a Tesla Cybertruck with a full MAGA vinyl wrap. He forced Trump, in his own home, to meet other guys whose job is video games. In the parking lot next to Trump's new ride, they did Trump's weird little hand dance.\n\nIt was an interesting choice for Trump to appear on an edgelord gamer's stream at a moment when his campaign desperately needs to shift the momentum in his favor. But Republicans have been dipping into the demo of conservative-leaning podcasts by and for Gen-Z guys for some time now. Last week, vice-presidential candidate J.D. Vance appeared on a podcast with the Nelk Boys, a group of Canadian influencers who rose to fame by doing Jackass-lite pranks and partying all the time; they have since become a must-stop visit for Republican politicians trying to get in front of fratty young voters. (In his hour with hosts Steiny and Kyle Forgeard, Vance talked about getting the call from Trump that he would be his next VP choice while his son wanted to talk to him about Pokémon. \"Shut the hell up for 30 seconds about Pikachu,\" Vance joked, unpleasantly, that he told his son. \"This is the most important phone call of my life. Please, just let me take this phone call.\") Trump himself appeared on the Nelk Boys' podcast back in 2022 in an episode that YouTube removed because Trump went on a rant about false election-fraud claims, which is a violation of the company's policy.\n\nTrump has yet to reprise his Nelk Boys appearance, but it looks like more is on the way from the Canadian group whose videos include \"We Corrupted an Amish Person!\" and \"Andrew Tate Stole Our Girl at the Club!\" Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Nelk Boys are involved in a $20 million PAC called Send the Vote. The group will target the \"growing movement of young people across this country rallying behind a pro-freedom, pro-America agenda,\" as its business partner told the Journal. Events include voter-registration drives at sports events and Ultimate Fighting Championship-adjacent parties in which attendees must prove they are registered to vote to get in. For what it's worth, UFC president Dana White appears to be the common thread between Trump and these young conservative men with talk shows. \"Shout-out to Dana,\" Ross said on Monday. \"There's nobody like him,\" Trump added.\n\nIt's too early to say if the plan will work to mobilize young male voters who may be moving toward the Republican Party. But at least Donald Trump appears to be having fun so far. This summer, he's gotten to golf on a stream with 30-year-old pro Bryson DeChambeau and talked about the world of combat sports with YouTuber and budding wrestling star Logan Paul. As many people have noted, his video with Paul was one of the only times we've seen Trump earnestly laugh in a long while."],"source":{"uri":["nymag.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["NYMag"]},"authors":[{"uri":["matt_stieb@nymag.com"],"name":["Matt Stieb"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/921/dc5/23fc82b5d42a77ba8378cd29825d673abe-broccoli-trump.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg"],"eventUri":["eng-9792754"],"sentiment":[0.0588],"wgt":[460582311],"relevance":[1]}]
