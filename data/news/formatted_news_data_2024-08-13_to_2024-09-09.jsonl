This information comes from a recent foreign agent disclosure filing.\n\nWhat Happened: Conway registered last Friday to represent Pinchuk's foundation. The filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act reveals that Conway will liaise with U.S. lawmakers and experts on Ukraine's interests and raise awareness about \"Ukrainians' fight for freedom and the Russian illegal war of aggression,\" reported The Hill.\n\nConway is also expected to encourage U.S. lawmakers to attend the Yalta European Strategy annual meeting in Kyiv on Sept. 13-14. She will represent the U.K. office of the Victor Pinchuk Foundation, a private, nonpartisan, philanthropic company focused on advancing various causes in Ukraine.\n\nSee Also: Anthony Scaramucci Says Trump Could Drop His Presidential Bid Against Kamala Harris If This Happens: 'I Know How This Man Thinks'\n\nThe filing also reveals that Pinchuk \"owns and controls\" the foundation, which is not owned or controlled by the Ukrainian government. However, the Ukrainian government is the \"principal beneficiary of the registrant's activities directed by the foreign principal.\"\n\nConway's agreement with the foundation includes a monthly fee of $50,000, with the term of the agreement running from July 25 to Nov. 14.\n\nThis move comes amidst hesitation from many Republicans to approve more aid to Ukraine. Conway's former boss, Trump, has previously suggested that additional aid to Ukraine could come as a loan and claimed he could end the war in 24 hours if he were in the White House.\n\nWhy It Matters: Conway is known for coining the phrase \"Alternative Facts\" during a Meet The Press interview in January 2017 when she defended White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer's false narrative about Trump's inauguration attendance figures.\n\nMore recently in 2022, she criticized Pennsylvania Democratic Senate nominee John Fetterman (D-Pa.) for his support of cannabis legalization.\n\nIn August 2023, she speculated that President Joe Biden might not participate in any debates in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election.

File Image/Reuters\n\nTuesday, August 6, is a day that is set to be underlined by various crucial events across the globe.\n\nTurmoil in Bangladesh has led its PM Sheikh Hasina to flee with the army coming in to form an interim government. It remains to be seen what step will be taken to ensure stability and peace.\n\nIn the US, Democratic party presidential nominee and current US Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to campaign in battleground states with her running mate.\n\nOver in Paris where the 2024 Olympics are in full swing, India's only athletics Olympic gold medalist Neeraj Chopra will enter the arena for his event - the Javelin throw.\n\nIndia is hosting the first Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Business Summit in New Delhi from today. The event will conclude on August 8.\n\nHasina flees, Bangladesh burns\n\nBangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has stepped down amidst violent protests across the country. The announcement of an interim government taking charge was made by Bangladesh Army Chief General Waqar-uz-Zaman on Monday.\n\nThere are unconfirmed reports suggesting she may be heading to a city in India.\n\nRecently, she faced accusations of suppressing the opposition and acting like a dictator. A movement had been ongoing in the country for over a month. In the last two days alone, hundreds of people have lost their lives in protests against the Hasina government.\n\nThe unrest initially began as a protest against job quotas but quickly escalated into widespread anger against the Hasina administration, involving people from all segments of society. It is believed that the united front presented by the opposition played a significant role in compelling Hasina to resign.\n\nHarris and co to tour battleground states\n\nUS Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running for president as a Democrat, will start a four-day visit to key states with her running mate on August 6, as announced by her campaign on Thursday.\n\nThis has led to increased speculation about the potential candidate. The identity of Harris's running mate for the 2024 presidential election remains a well-kept secret and is expected to be revealed today. According to US media reports, top contenders include Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.\n\nHarris, 59, is the only person who has submitted paperwork to be the Democratic Party's nominee for the November 5 presidential election after US President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the race and endorsed her as the candidate on July 20.\n\nNeeraj Chopra enters\n\nOne of India's top medal contenders, Olympic gold medalist Neeraj Chopra, was yet to begin competing. Although the track and field events at the Paris Olympics are already in progress, Chopra's event, the men's javelin throw came a few days later.\n\nThe men's javelin qualifiers is set for Tuesday, when Chopra will make his first appearance in the French capital. If the defending champion advances to the final, he will compete again to retain his title on August 8.\n\nChopra won the gold medal in the men's javelin at the delayed Tokyo Olympics with a throw of 87.58 meters. After his victory at the Tokyo Games, he also secured the World Championship title.\n\nBIMSTEC in India - A first\n\nIndia will host the inaugural Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Business Summit in New Delhi from August 6-8.

It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\nDow drops 1,000 points, and Japanese stocks suffer worst crash since 1987 as markets quake worldwide\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsened and set off another sell-off for financial markets around the world. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed a 12.4% plunge for Japan's Nikkei 225, its worst since 1987. Treasury yields pared their losses after a report showed U.S. services businesses are continuing to grow. But worries are still high after Friday's report showing U.S. employers pulled back on hiring last month by more than expected.\n\nTropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia and the Carolinas\n\nHORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with torrential rain, high winds and flooding, contributing to at least five deaths as it turned menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatened to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities. Record-setting rain was expected to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Historic cities including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, are gearing up for potential high water. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 50 mph.\n\nEx-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.\n\nVenezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo \"falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council\" and they openly incited \"police and military officials to disobey the laws.\"\n\nRally dates are set. Venues are chosen. The only thing missing for Harris' blitz is her VP choice\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.\n\nKamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.\n\nIn Israel and Lebanon, life goes on even as the region teeters on the edge of all-out war\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- In Beirut, shops are open and traffic is as snarled as ever. In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Everyone expects that an all-out war would be far more devastating than any previous conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nBangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.\n\nWhat's the deal with the Olympics?

The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed a 12.4% plunge for Japan's Nikkei 225, its worst since 1987. Treasury yields pared their losses after a report showed U.S. services businesses are continuing to grow. But worries are still high after Friday's report showing U.S. employers pulled back on hiring last month by more than expected.\n\nTropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia and the Carolinas\n\nHORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with torrential rain, high winds and flooding, contributing to at least five deaths as it turned menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatened to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities. Record-setting rain was expected to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Historic cities including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, are gearing up for potential high water. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 50 mph.\n\nGoogle illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge has ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\nEx-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.\n\nVenezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo \"falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council\" and they openly incited \"police and military officials to disobey the laws.\"\n\nRally dates are set. Venues are chosen. The only thing missing for Harris' blitz is her VP choice\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.\n\nKamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.\n\nIn Israel and Lebanon, life goes on even as the region teeters on the edge of all-out war\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- In Beirut, shops are open and traffic is as snarled as ever. In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Everyone expects that an all-out war would be far more devastating than any previous conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nBangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.\n\nWhat's the deal with the Olympics? Your burning questions, answered\n\nPARIS (AP) -- The Olympics have their own language, traditions and rules. And they are ever-evolving. It can be a lot to take in. The Associated Press is answering some of the most asked questions about the Paris Games. What's in the box that athletes get with their medals? An official poster, meaning they can skip the gift shop. And if you wanted to know why the PARIS Olympics are in so many different cities, it's a combination of factors including space and appropriate facilities. It's also not uncommon among Olympics.","Dow drops 1,000 points, and Japanese stocks suffer worst crash since 1987 as markets quake worldwide\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsened and set off another sell-off for financial markets around the world.

Seventeen other people have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting.

Bailey said in a statement that New York's \"illicit prosecution\" has undermined the Republican candidate's ability to run for president.\n\nBailey filed the suit in July, arguing that the state of New York violated \"Missourians' First Amendment right to hear from a presidential candidate in the 2024 presidential election.\"\n\nThe lawsuit adds that the state's \"overt meddling in a presidential election sabotages Missourians' ability to hear from and cast a fully-informed vote for president mere months before the election.\"\n\nNew York argued the lawsuit was flawed and that Missouri did not suffer sufficient injury that would give it standing to sue. New York's solicitor general wrote in a brief that allowing the suit to go forward would \"permit an extraordinary and dangerous end-run around former President Trump's ongoing state court proceedings and the statutory limitations on this Court's jurisdiction to review state court decisions.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court denied the request without outlining its reasoning, writing, \"Missouri's motion for leave to file a bill of complaint is denied, and its motion for preliminary relief or a stay is dismissed as moot.\"\n\nConservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito said they would \"grant the motion for leave to file the bill of complaint but would not grant other relief.\n\nA Manhattan jury convicted Trump in May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with money sent to porn actor Stormy Daniels.

Steady economic growth and robust hiring have endured against most analysts' expectations, the news outlet added.\n\nThis comes as the 2024 presidential election is fast approaching, as Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are expected to face off in November.\n\nIn wake of the market news, Trump blamed Harris, taking aim at her in a video posted to his Truth Social account, sharing a video and captioning it \"Kamala Krash.\"\n\nTrump previously took credit for record highs under President Joe Biden's leadership.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the campaigns of Trump and Harris via email for comment on Monday.\n\nA Harris campaign account, Kamala HQ, posted to X, formerly Twitter, a clip of Trump from a rally in which he says: \"If Biden wins, you're gonna have a stock market collapse the likes of which you've never had.\"\n\nIt is followed by a separate image of a post made by Trump on Truth Social that says: \"THIS IS THE TRUMP STOCK MARKET.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign post reads: \"Right: Trump in 2020 claiming the stock market will collapse if President Biden wins. Left: Trump [in January] desperately trying to take credit for the stock market hitting record highs under President Biden.\"\n\nExperts have reacted by advising investors to maintain a long-term perspective, particularly for retirement funds, adding that panic selling during market downturns typically results in greater losses, according to AP.\n\nJacob Channel, senior economist for LendingTree, noted that markets have historically recovered from worse sell-offs, the news outlet added.","Dow drops 1,000 points, and Japanese stocks suffer worst crash since 1987 as markets quake worldwide\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsened and set off another sell-off for financial markets around the world. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed a 12.4% plunge for Japan's Nikkei 225, its worst since 1987. Treasury yields pared their losses after a report showed U.S. services businesses are continuing to grow.

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with torrential rain and high winds, contributing to at least four deaths as it turned menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatened to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities. Record-setting rain was expected to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Historic cities including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, are gearing up for potential high water. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 50 mph.\n\nGoogle illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. After reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\nEx-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.\n\nVenezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo \"falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council\" and they openly incited \"police and military officials to disobey the laws.\"\n\nRally dates are set. Venues are chosen. The only thing missing for Harris' blitz is her VP choice\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.\n\nKamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.\n\nIn Israel and Lebanon, life goes on even as the region teeters on the edge of all-out war\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- In Beirut, shops are open and traffic is as snarled as ever. In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Everyone expects that an all-out war would be far more devastating than any previous conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nBangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.\n\nWhat's the deal with the Olympics?

She needs a lot of people around her. She needs all the support she can get. Any candidate does,\" Louis said. \"One of the important things that we do and really think about is how do we educate people around the choices they have thus far and getting out and making sure they are registered to exercise their constitutional right to vote.\"\n\nLouis explains their mission involves the work of individual sorority members. They are not acting on behalf of the sorority itself.\n\nShe points to that same perspective when it comes to the influence of the Divine Nine, or the network of 9 historically Black sororities and fraternities.\n\n\"This is a continuation of that training ground, so we act in the same way. We've always been about civics and rights of people and uplift,\" Louis said.\n\nLouis and a number of line sisters got to visit with Harris in July after she spoke at the sorority's national conference in Dallas.\n\n\"A bunch of our line sisters were all together,\" she said. \"I think ultimately 14 of us were in town at the boule of our 38-member line.\"\n\nLouis also mentions another sorority training ground trait is confidence.\n\n\"What we demonstrated in the last few weeks is that we can be formidable in fundraising, and that's something we've been doing since the beginning as our group of line sisters, supporting each other across the country whenever someone is running for something,\" she said.\n\nThis time, it just happens to be the highest office in the country.\n\n\"I'm very excited, very excited,\" Louis said. \"There's a lot of work to be done.\"","Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is one of Vice President Kamala Harris' top picks for a presidential running mate, and a decision is expected by Tuesday.\n\nHarris has narrowed down her list to two or three candidates, according to national media reports, with the vice president meeting with finalists over the weekend. Walz, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, of Arizona, met with Harris on Sunday, the Washington Post and others reported.\n\nWalz would bring his liberal record as governor, experience in Congress as well as small-town Midwestern credentials and his background as a school teacher and his military service to the ticket.\n\nAnd in recent weeks he's gained national media attention for going on the attack against Republicans by calling them \"weird,\" a tactic that's gained traction among Democrats trying to convince swing voters to come to their side.\n\nThe odds look decent that Minnesota's governor will join the Democratic presidential ticket.\n\nSo if he does, what happens next?\n\nShould Walz run with Harris, he will continue serving as governor through the presidential election. But if Harris defeats former President Donald Trump in November, Walz will have to step down.\n\nIf that happens, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan would become governor of Minnesota for the rest of Walz's second four-year term, which ends in January 2027. She would be the first woman and first Native American to hold the state's highest elected office.\n\nEven if Walz doesn't get picked as vice president, he's widely seen as a favorite for a cabinet position in a future Democratic administration. If Harris wins the 2024 presidential election, Walz could end up leaving the governor's office if he's asked to lead an executive agency like the Department of Education or Veterans Affairs.\n\nThe last Minnesota to serve as vice president was Walter Mondale in President Jimmy Carter's administration. Before that Hubert Humphrey served with President Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\nWith the lieutenant governor's office open, the Minnesota Constitution calls for the \"presiding officer\" of the Senate to fill the position.\n\nIf that were to happen right now, it would mean Senate President Bobby Joe Champion, a Minneapolis DFLer, would fill the role. He would become Minnesota's first Black lieutenant governor.\n\nThe Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party currently splits control of the Senate 33-33 with Republicans after the June resignation of State Sen. Kelly Morrison, DFL-Deephaven, who is running for Minnesota's 3rd Congressional District. However, the Legislature isn't scheduled to convene until January.\n\nThere's a special election for Morrison's Senate seat in November on the same day as the general election that will determine who controls the majority in the Minnesota Senate. The rest of the Minnesota Senate isn't up for election until 2026.\n\nIf Champion were to become lieutenant governor and step down from the senate, there would also be a special election for his seat. Democrats likely would regain control as his north Minneapolis district is a safe Democratic stronghold.\n\nThough past transitions haven't gone quite as smoothly.\n\nIn January 2018, then-Gov. Mark Dayton appointed Lt. Gov. Tina Smith to fill former U.S. Sen. Al Franken's seat after Franken resigned amid a sexual harassment scandal.\n\nThe move automatically made Republican Senate President Michelle Fischbach the lieutenant governor.\n\nFischbach refused to resign from the Senate as it would have ended a slim Republican majority in the chamber. That prompted lawsuits from DFLers, who alleged holding two offices at once violated the state Constitution.\n\nFischbach refused to take the oath of her new office, and instead called herself \"acting lieutenant governor.\" But she resigned from the Senate in May following the 2018 legislative session.","The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a lawsuit filed by Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey seeking to lift a gag order and delay Donald Trump's sentencing on multiple convictions in his New York City hush money trial. Bailey said in a statement that New York's \"illicit prosecution\" has undermined the Republican candidate's ability to run for president.\n\nBailey filed the suit in July, arguing that the state of New York violated \"Missourians' First Amendment right to hear from a presidential candidate in the 2024 presidential election.\"\n\nThe lawsuit adds that the state's \"overt meddling in a presidential election sabotages Missourians' ability to hear from and cast a fully-informed vote for president mere months before the election.\"\n\nNew York argued the lawsuit was flawed and that Missouri did not suffer sufficient injury that would give it standing to sue. New York's solicitor general wrote in a brief that allowing the suit to go forward would \"permit an extraordinary and dangerous end-run around former President Trump's ongoing state court proceedings and the statutory limitations on this Court's jurisdiction to review state court decisions.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court denied the request without outlining its reasoning, writing, \"Missouri's motion for leave to file a bill of complaint is denied, and its motion for preliminary relief or a stay is dismissed as moot.\"\n\nConservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito said they would \"grant the motion for leave to file the bill of complaint but would not grant other relief.\n\nA Manhattan jury convicted Trump in May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with money sent to porn star Stormy Daniels.

Pelosi was reported to be one of the members of Congress who pushed for Biden to step down from the race in an effort to have a better shot at the Democratic Party defeating Donald Trump in the 2024 election.\n\nPelosi brushed off Biden being mad at her and the representative being the one behind his decision to step down during an appearance on \"CBS Sunday Morning Show.\"\n\n\"I've never shared any conversation with a president of the United States publicly, no,\" Pelosi said when asked what she told the current president.\n\nPelosi was asked if Biden is furious at her.\n\n\"He knows that I love him very much.\"\n\nPelosi said she was not the leader of a plan to push Biden out and said she did not call one person despite reports that say otherwise.\n\nListing Biden's accomplishments during his presidency, Pelosi recalled his leadership of the NATO Summit and the president being at the \"top of his game\" in recent months.\n\n\"He was in a good place to make whatever decision -- the top of his game. Such a consequential president of the United States, a Mount Rushmore kind of president of the United States.\"\n\nMount Rushmore in South Dakota currently features George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and Thomas Jefferson, all considered to be among the best presidents in American history.\n\n\"Well, you got Teddy Roosevelt up there, and he's wonderful. I don't say take him down. But you can add Biden.\"\n\nWhile Pelosi has stated that she was not behind the plan to oust Biden, recent public comments could point to being influential in the decision. Pelosi said that Biden needed to make a decision about the 2024 election even after he stated he was still in. The representative also said it was up to Biden to decide if he was still going to run after the president said he was \"firmly committed\" to the 2024 election.\n\nAlong with being known for her recent reported ouster of Biden, Pelosi is widely followed for her Congress Trading activity, which has recently included her husband buying shares of semiconductor stock NVIDIA Corporation.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nCongress Is Making Huge Investments.

Your burning questions, answered\n\nPARIS (AP) -- The Olympics have their own language, traditions and rules. And they are ever-evolving. It can be a lot to take in.

An official poster, meaning they can skip the gift shop. And if you wanted to know why the PARIS Olympics are in so many different cities, it's a combination of factors including space and appropriate facilities. It's also not uncommon among Olympics.","Kamala Harris, the party-installed alternative to Joe Biden in the 2024 presidential election, is now squarely in the national spotlight. She and her handlers like to pretend this gives her the opportunity to invent her political persona out of whole cloth so that she can appeal to that decisive section of the American electorate that can be swayed in one direction or another.\n\nIn fact, Harris has a long political record, one that is now coming back to haunter her as she tries to portray herself as competent, professional, and middle-of-the-road. And if there's one issue that has consistently defined her extreme brand of far-left politics, it is contempt for the Second Amendment. Try as she might, she cannot outrun that legacy.\n\nWe began delving into Harris's record on Second Amendment issues last week. This included - during her time as a state and local politician in California -- denying that the Second Amendment protects a right to keep and bear arms unrelated to militia service and insisting that it has no bearing on state or local gun control laws. These are not only extreme positions in 2024, after the Supreme Court has authoritatively ruled on these issues to the contrary, they were extreme positions then. A 2008 Gallup poll that showed only 20% of Americans agreed with Harris's interpretation of the Second Amendment as applying solely to state militias, while 73% did not. In San Francisco, where she was free to be as far-left as she wanted, Harris was perfectly willing to be out of step with mainstream American thought on the Second Amendment.\n\nLater, as a candidate for the democratic presidential nomination in 2020, Harris even mocked Joe Biden's reluctance to use executive authority to \"eliminate\" so-called \"assault weapons.\" This is the term anti-gun Democrats use for America's most popular rifles, including the AR-15. While clearly agreeable to that idea in principle, even Biden had to admit it was unconstitutional. Yet when asked for her opinion on the matter, Harris laughed in Biden's face, and quipped: \"I would just say, hey, Joe, instead of saying no we can't, let's say, yes we can.\"\n\nSaying \"yes we can\" to unconstitutional executive actions to ban and confiscate America's favorite guns now presents a problem for Harris. Her strategy to deal with that problem? Gaslight and deny it.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, a reliable ally of the Democrat party, \"video clips of [Kamala Harris's] old statements and interviews are being weaponized as Republicans aim to define her as a left-wing radical who is out of step with swing voters.\"\n\n\"Weaponization\" is strange way to describe letting a person's own words and professional actions define the person's values, beliefs, and policy positions.\n\nEven stranger is how the Harris campaign plans to respond to those who bring up what the candidate herself has said and done during her political career, according to that same article: \"The Harris campaign will rebut most of Republicans' attacks by arguing that they are exaggerating or lying about her record, said a campaign official briefed on the plans who was not authorized to discuss them publicly.\"\n\nIt would be one thing for Harris to claim she was wrong then and has since come to her senses and changed her mind. However unconvincing that might be, it would at least in theory be within the realm of possibility.\n\nBut Harris and her handlers want to rewrite history itself to deny the positions she took, the things she said, and their necessary implications.\n\nSo who are you going to believe? Kamala Harris then? Or Kamala Harris now? What you cannot believe, so we are told, is your own ears and eyes.\n\nThere is a term in American law called \"declaration against interest.\" It is used when judging the reliability of a statement by a person who is not available in court to answer for his or her own words. This principle holds that when a person says something that is clearly contrary to his or her own best interests, it is more likely to be true. Put another way, when people are trying to protect themselves, they lie. But when they think they can talk with impunity, they tell the truth.\n\nIn the bubbles of California, San Francisco, and a Democrat primary, where far-left opinions are fashionable and rewarded, Harris could truly speak her mind on guns. Now that she is answerable for those opinions to a wider American audience, she is - right on cue - trying to retreat from them. And, right on cue, her media collaborators are doing their best to help her deny and rewrite the historical record.\n\nAmerica's gun owners, however, should neither forget nor forgive where Harris has stood on their constitutional right to keep and bear arms. We will have plenty more to say on that record - or, more precisely, we'll tell you what Harris herself has said -in the weeks to come.","A soldier carries chairs as election workers prepare polling stations in Caracas, Venezuela, Friday, July 26, 2024.

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's opposition leaders are calling on the country's armed forces to abandon their support of President Nicolás Maduro and stop repressing demonstrators who have come out in force to dispute the leader's claim he prevailed in last Sunday's election.\n\nThe armed forces are traditionally the arbiter of political disputes in Venezuela and have been key to Maduro's grip on power ever since he took over the so-called Bolivarian revolution in 2013 from his mentor, the late Hugo Chávez.\n\nSo far, they've shown no signs of ditching Maduro even in the face of credible evidence presented by the opposition that it trounced the self-proclaimed socialist at the polls by a more than 2-to-1 margin.\n\nIn a message posted Monday on social media, Edmundo González -- who the U.S. and a half dozen countries have recognized as the victor -- and opposition leader Maria Corina Machado called on rank and file members of the security forces to rethink their loyalty.\n\n\"We appeal to the conscience of the military and police to put themselves on the side of the people and their families,\" the two wrote in a long message.\n\n\"We won this election without any doubt. It was an electoral avalanche,\" the two continued. \"Now it's up to all of us to respect the voice of the people.\"\n\nAuthorities have declared Maduro the victor in last Sunday's election but have yet to produce voting tallies to prove he won. The opposition claims to have collected records from more than 80% of the 30,000 polling booths nationwide showing it won.\n\nMaduro announced Saturday that the government has arrested 2,000 opponents and at a rally in Caracas he pledged to detain more people and send them to prison. The post-electoral uprising has also claimed at least 11 deaths, according to Foro Penal, a Caracas-based human rights group.\n\nThe Venezuela-based human rights organization Provea, in a report issued Monday analyzing the post-election climate, concluded that the government's response to silence people's discontent has been \"through the disproportionate use of force\" that has resulted in the deaths of protesters, \"the open coordinated action between security forces and groups of armed civilians in favor of Nicolás Maduro to calm the protests, and the exponential increase in arbitrary arrests.\"\n\nThe organization reported that based on figures announced by the Attorney General's Office last week, the number of arrests against real or perceived government opponents is equivalent to about 42% \"of the total number of arbitrary arrests recorded by Provea between April and August 2017, the most important cycle of protests in the country since 1989.\"\n\nGonzález and Machado in their missive called on Venezuelans with family members serving in the security forces to urge their loved ones not to attack protesters and obey illegal orders. It said it would offer \"guarantees\" to soldiers who follow the constitution even while promising there would be no impunity for those behind abuses and following illegal orders.\n\nBoth González, a former diplomat, and Machado -- who was barred by the government from running -- have gone into hiding, saying they fear they will be arrested or killed. Maduro and his cadres have threatened to lock them both up.\n\nAs Venezuelans fight Maduro on the streets, pressure is also building internationally for the Venezuelan government to publish the full breakdown of the electoral results.\n\nBut so far, Maduro has instead asked the country's supreme court -- which like all institutions in Venezuela is packed with loyalists -- to review any claims of irregularities.\n\n\"Respect for popular sovereignty is what moves us to defend the transparency of the (election) results,\" Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said Monday in a press conference alongside fellow leftist President Gabriel Boric of Chile.\n\nBoric, who cast doubt on Maduro's victory claim in an unexpectedly strong statement within hours of Venezuela's July 28 election, told reporters that he and Lula discussed the situation in Venezuela on Monday, without elaborating. The leaders did not take questions and their carefully worded statements signaled how leftist leaders in the region are gingerly trying to show respect for Venezuela's sovereignty while voicing doubts about the official results.\n\nA few of Maduro's staunch allies -- including Russia, China and Cuba -- have applauded his victory. On Monday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian held a telephone call with Maduro and reiterated his congratulations and \"condemned any foreign interference in Venezuela's internal affairs,\" Pezeshkian's office said.\n\n--\n\nAP Writers Joshua Goodman in Miami and Isabel DeBre in Buenos Aires, Argentina, contributed to this report.","Dow drops 1,000 points, and Japanese stocks suffer worst crash since 1987 as markets quake worldwide\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsened and set off another sell-off for financial markets around the world.

Tim Walberg, have introduced bills to reverse ambitious new vehicle fuel economy regulations issued by the Biden administration.\n\nThe administration's Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, commonly known as CAFE, were finalized in June and would require automakers' new vehicle fleets to achieve an average fuel economy of 53.5 miles per gallon by 2032.\n\n\"The extreme (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) CAFE standards are the latest attempt by the Biden-Harris administration to strip away choice from American consumers and mandate EVs,\" the Tipton Republican said in a statement about his bill.\n\nThough the in-the-weeds technicalities of regulatory affairs aren't usually popular household issues, rules affecting the future of the U.S. auto industry have become a mainstay of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nRepublicans -- headlined by presidential nominee Donald Trump -- have consistently railed against President Joe Biden's efforts to significantly curb tailpipe emissions and encourage a shift toward electric vehicles as ways to fight climate change and keep pace with China's emergence as the world's leading EV maker.\n\nBiden and his allies, meanwhile, have cheered the CAFE standards and similar efforts as smart for consumers' wallets and prudent for the future of the auto industry.\n\n\"Not only will these new standards save Americans money at the pump every time they fill up, they will also decrease harmful pollution and make America less reliant on foreign oil,\" U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in June. \"These standards will save car owners more than $600 in gasoline costs over the lifetime of their vehicle.\"\n\nMore: Biden scales back fuel economy standards amid tough political and business realities\n\nRepublican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is leading a companion push on the Senate side to cancel the CAFE standards. The bills in both chambers invoke the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to rescind regulations shortly after they're finalized.\n\nThe effort is unlikely to succeed in the current politically divided Congress.\n\nHowever, Republicans might be able to revive the action early next year if they win control of both chambers and the White House in November. That is due to a so-called lookback provision in the CRA that allows Congress to revisit late-passing rules from a previous presidential administration.\n\nThe highly-anticipated trigger date for the lookback period will not be final until at least one chamber of Congress adjourns for the year.\n\nMore like this: Trump pledge to reverse Biden's EV push won't be so easy, experts say. Here's why\n\nAll regulations finalized after that date -- on average July 18, per a report from the Administrative Conference of the United States -- would be open to renewed challenges if Republicans manage to sweep the general elections.\n\nThat would keep the June 7 fuel economy standards safe from a later CRA challenge, though some observers think the window will close earlier this year.\n\nThe CAFE rule is one of many actions from Biden meant to reduce the environmental impact of consumer vehicles, which make up about 16% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, per EPA data.\n\nHis administration has devoted considerable time and resources to the matter, employing incentives and punitive regulations that push the auto industry toward electrification.\n\nOther efforts have included two other key rules aimed at reducing tailpipe emissions; a $7,500 tax credit on qualifying new EV purchases via the climate-minded Inflation Reduction Act; $7.5 billion for EV charger buildout via the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law; IRA-funded manufacturing subsidies to repurpose old industrial centers for EVs; and a set of new tariffs that aim to protect U.S. automakers from competition with China, which has emerged as the world leader in EVs.\n\nMore: Voters want Michigan to build EVs, but they don't want to buy them, poll finds\n\nRepublicans have roundly opposed those efforts.\n\n\"The Biden-Harris administration has declared war against affordable gas-powered cars,\" Cruz said in a statement, alluding to Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. \"I'm leading the effort in the Senate to stop radical environmentalists from both abusing the rulemaking process and trying to force electric vehicles on consumers who do not want them.\"\n\n\"Unlike the Biden-Harris administration, Republicans continue to fight for consumers and innovators to have the ability to shape the future of the auto industry,\" Walberg added, \"not just unelected bureaucrats issuing radical mandates from Washington.\"","The officials from Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Michigan, New Mexico and Washington said Grok misled users after President Joe Biden withdrew his reelection bid.\n\nFive secretaries of state on Monday urged Elon Musk to fix his social media platform X's artificial intelligence search assistant after it allegedly shared false information about the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe secretaries in a letter to Musk said that X's AI chatbot Grok misled users about ballot deadlines in numerous states shortly after President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid against former President Donald Trump on July 21.\n\nMusk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, had endorsed Republican presidential nominee Trump before Biden quit the race and backed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee.\n\nWithin hours of Biden dropping out, a Grok post claimed, 'The ballot deadline has passed for several states for the 2024 election,'\" according to the letter to Musk from the secretaries of state, who oversee their states' elections.\n\n-snip-\n\nMusk has said Grok uses Twitter/X posts to train, so his AI is being trained with a LOT of incorrect information & lies.

The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed a 12.4% plunge for Japan's Nikkei 225, its worst since 1987. Treasury yields pared their losses after a report showed U.S. services businesses are continuing to grow.

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with torrential rain and high winds, contributing to at least four deaths as it turned menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatened to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities. Record-setting rain was expected to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Historic cities including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, are gearing up for potential high water. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 50 mph.\n\nGoogle illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. After reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\nEx-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case.

Seventeen other people charged in the case have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Rudy Giuliani at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She had pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.\n\nRally dates are set.

The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.\n\nKamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.\n\nIn Israel and Lebanon, life goes on even as the region teeters on the edge of all-out war\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- In Beirut, shops are open and traffic is as snarled as ever. In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Everyone expects that an all-out war would be far more devastating than any previous conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nBangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.\n\nSupreme Court shuts down Missouri's long shot push to lift Trump's gag order in hush-money case\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court has shut down a long-shot push from Missouri seeking to remove a gag order in former President Donald Trump's hush-money case and delay his sentencing in New York. The decision comes Monday after the Missouri attorney general had argued in the unusual request that the New York gag order wrongly limits what the GOP presidential nominee could say on the campaign trail and Trump's eventual sentence could affect his ability to travel. New York countered that the limited gag order does allow Trump to talk about the issues important to voters, and the sentence may not affect his movement at all.\n\nWhat's the deal with the Olympics?

Vance criticizing Simone Biles pausing her Olympic career for mental health have gone viral.\n\nAmerican gymnast Simone Biles was golden at the 2024 Summer Olympics, winning a total of three gold medals and one silver medal, helping set new records for her team along the way.\n\nThe success of Biles comes after the 2020 Olympics, which saw the gymnast unexpectedly step down for a mental health break, something that now vice-presidential pick J.D. Vance was critical of at the time.\n\nWhat Happened: Biles was one of the most anticipated athletes making their return to the 2024 Summer Olympics, which have aired on Comcast Corp CMCSA-owned NBC and streamed on Peacock since the games began on July 26.\n\nThe American gymnast helped her team win the all-around gymnastics team gold medal and also took home the gold for the individual all-around, adding to her many accomplishments in the Summer Olympics and world competitions. With the medals she has won at the 2024 Olympics, her career total is now seven golds, two silvers and two bronze medals.\n\nBiles is now the most decorated U.S. gymnast in Olympic history and has the most gold medals among U.S. gymnasts. The wins at the 2024 Summer Olympics also helped Biles become the oldest all-around champion (27 years of age) in 72 years and the first two-time all-around winner since 1968. Biles is also the first gymnast to ever win the individual all-around eight years apart.\n\nIn the 2020 Summer Olympics, Biles unexpectedly dropped out during the team performance, which the U.S. team won a silver medal.\n\nBiles dropped out to focus on her mental health and said she had a case of the twisties, where her body and mind were not aligned, and put an emphasis on her safety over continuing to compete.\n\nThe move was praised by many athletes and Biles' sponsors, but a man running for U.S. Senate at the time took exception to the praise for the gymnast.\n\n\"I think it reflects poorly on our sort of therapeutic society that we try to praise people, not for moments of strength, not for moments of heroism, but for their weakest moments,\" J.D. Vance said in an interview at the time.\n\nVance was critical of how Biles was being perceived by the public.\n\n\"We've tried to turn a very tragic moment, Simone Biles quitting the Olympic team, into this act of heroism.\"\n\nNow the vice-presidential pick for the 2024 election alongside Donald Trump, past comments by Vance have gone viral during the 2024 Summer Olympics.\n\nDemocratic National Committee spokeswoman Aida Ross said Vance has no room to talk about \"anyone else's weakest moments,\" as reported by the New York Times.\n\n\"While the rest of the country is celebrating the U.S.A. women's gymnastics team's performance at the Olympics, J.D. Vance is facing his weakest moment amid a gaffe-filled rollout that has left him as the most unpopular V.P. pick in decades,\" Ross said.\n\nRead Also: How Much Are Physical 2024 Olympic Gold Medal, Silver Medal And Bronze Medals Worth? The Answer Might Surprise You\n\nWhy It's Important: The past criticism from Vance could paint a picture of his lack of support and empathy for those dealing with mental health issues and comes at a time when Olympic athletes are being celebrated.\n\nBiles had therapy sessions with her U.S.-based therapist during the Olympics, according to the report.\n\n\"The Olympics is such a draining process for the athletes when it's multiple days of competition, so you definitely have to be on top of your mental, as well as your physical,\" Biles said.\n\nBiles also said that past negative comments were painful at the time and hurtful, but the people who criticized her are now \"really quiet.\"\n\n\"After all these years of putting the mental work in, it's paid off.\"\n\nWhile sponsors have dropped athletes for performance issues or for off-the-field issues, Biles saw support from some of her biggest sponsors after dropping out of the 2020 Summer Olympics.\n\n\"We stand by Simone and support her well-being both in and out of competition,\" Athleta said at the time. \"Being the best also means knowing how to take care of yourself.\"\n\nAthleta, which is owned by Gap Inc GPS, landed Biles to a deal in 2021 pulling her away from apparel giant Nike Inc NKE. Biles said at the time that Athleta aligned better with her values and came as the larger apparel company was facing accusations of poor treatment towards female athletes.\n\nSponsor Visa Inc V also supported Biles after she withdrew from the 2020 games saying the gymnast was \"incredibly brave.\"\n\nCoca-Cola Co KO-owned Core Power said Biles showed that \"her courage and strength extend well beyond the mat\" at the time.\n\nThe brands that stuck by Biles were supportive again in the 2024 Olympics, with Coca-Cola making the gymnast the face of its Powerade brand's Olympic campaign. A commercial called \"The Vault,\" featured Biles navigating challenges and triumphs in life. The Powerade brand put an emphasis on athletes' mental and physical wellbeing with its Olympic sponsorship and launched its \"Pause is Power\" platform in 2022.\n\nWhile Vance will either win or lose in the 2024 presidential election, Biles is very much already a winner in 2024 and one of the most celebrated American Olympic athletes ever.\n\nCheck This Out:\n\n* Lawmakers Made Huge Investments This Year. Get Tips On What They Bought And Sold Ahead Of The 2024 Election With Our Easy-to-Use Tool\n\nPhotos: Shutterstock\n\nMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs","The image of Ryan Reynolds appears to be created with artificial intelligence. Reynolds has not yet publicly endorsed a candidate in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nWith the 2024 presidential election around the corner, celebrities have voiced their support for Republican nominee former President Donald Trump or presumptive Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAn image recently went viral on social media appearing to show \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" star Ryan Reynolds wearing a t-shirt that says \"Kamala removes nasty orange stains,\" in the shape of a Tide logo, referencing Harris and Trump.\n\nSome people who commented on the photo claimed the image is fake.\n\nIs the image of Ryan Reynolds wearing a Kamala Harris shirt real?\n\nNo, the image of Ryan Reynolds wearing a Kamala Harris shirt isn't real.\n\nThe image of Ryan Reynolds wearing a Kamala Harris shirt isn't real. There are signs this image was likely created using artificial intelligence.\n\nGenerative AI is a technology that can produce new content, including images, videos, audio and text based on a prompt.\n\nVERIFY analyzed the image and determined there are a number of visual cues that it is fake.\n\nThe hands on what appears to be Reynolds' body are misshapen and pixelated, with the knuckles on the thumb protruding more than normal. His skin looks too smooth in several places and his ears in the viral photo are much smaller than Reynolds' real ears. There is also a shadow under his jaw line onto his neck that does not look realistic. Reynolds appears to be wearing a watch, but a closer look shows the watch face is covered with pink dots.\n\nReynolds' nose in the viral image does not match real pictures of him. There is also a tattoo on the left forearm in the viral image, which appears misshapen and cut off. Reynolds doesn't have a tattoo there. On Instagram, he has posted several images while wearing short sleeve shirts and a similar tattoo can't be seen in any of them.\n\nA close look at the shirt in the viral image also contains clues that it's likely AI-generated. Even though the shirt is wrinkled, the image looks flat. The image's colors are much more vibrant than anything else in the photo, and the shirt's black color appears to bleed down one side of Reynolds' arm - another sign of an AI-generated photo.\n\nVERIFY also conducted a reverse image search using RevEye and found no reputable sources have published the photo of Reynolds wearing a Harris shirt. That is another indicator this image is made with artificial intelligence. Reynolds is a high-profile celebrity and if he was seen wearing this shirt, it would have been covered by the media.\n\nReynolds has also not publicly endorsed a candidate in the current presidential election. Reynolds was born and raised in Canada and became a U.S. citizen in 2018. He voted for the first time in the 2020 election, but did not share who he voted for.\n\nVERIFY reached out to Reynolds' camp for comment and did not hear back at the time of publication.","Kyle Rittenhouse is creating a stir online among Donald Trump's supporters for declaring that he would not vote for the former president in the 2024 presidential election, then walking back that statement.\n\nRittenhouse posted a video to his X account on Thursday, Aug. 1, stating that he'd be writing in former Texas congressman Ron Paul on the ballot rather than Trump.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Donald Trump had bad advisors making him bad on the Second Amendment and that is my issue. If you can not be completely uncompromisable on the Second Amendment, I will not vote for you and I will write somebody else in,\" Rittenhouse said. \"We need champions for the Second Amendment or our rights will be eaten away and eroded each day. I support my decision and I have no takebacks.\"\n\nHis declaration seemed absolute, but a mere 12 hours later he deleted his post and walked back his statements.\n\n\"My comments made last night were ill-informed and unproductive. I'm 100% behind Donald Trump and encourage every gun owner to join me in helping send him back to the White House,\" Rittenhouse wrote in a follow-up post.\n\nThe 21-year-old is widely known for shooting three protesters, killing two of them, during a racial justice protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in 2020. Jurors cleared the then-17-year-old of all the charges, including intentional homicide, after his attorneys argued he acted in self-defense.\n\nMany Trump operatives and rightwing politicians praised the verdict, so his proclamation that he would vote for Ron Paul, a now-retired politician, came as a shock to many MAGA supporters.\n\nRon Paul served in the House of Representatives in the 1970s and 1980s and then from 1997 to 2013. He launched three unsuccessful bids for president -- one in 1988 as a Libertarian and then two in 2008 and 2013 when he sought the Republican nomination, according to his biography on the Congress website.\n\nMany who back Trump condemned Rittenhouse as \"treasonous\" in light of all the support the former president's camp has given him in recent years.\n\n\"Treasonous Kyle Rittenhouse has apologized for his blasphemous statements about our glorious MAGA Movement,\" one X user wrote.\n\n\"Just remember, when it was political poison to take your side, Trump and MAGA was there for you during your lowest point,\" another person wrote.\n\nIn the years since the acquittal, Rittenhouse has fashioned himself as a gun rights activist.\n\nHe went on a controversial tour earlier this year to speak to students at three different colleges about \"the importance of the Second Amendment and the lies of (Black Lives Matter).\" News of his scheduled appearances was met with opposition by many students, and massive protests broke out when he visited the campuses.","Dow drops 1,000 points, and Japanese stocks suffer worst crash since 1987 as markets quake worldwide\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsened and set off another sell-off for financial markets around the world. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed a 12.4% plunge for Japan's Nikkei 225, its worst since 1987. Treasury yields pared their losses after a report showed U.S. services businesses are continuing to grow. But worries are still high after Friday's report showing U.S. employers pulled back on hiring last month by more than expected.\n\nTropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia and the Carolinas\n\nHORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with torrential rain and high winds, contributing to at least four deaths as it turned menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatened to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities. The storm made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 50 mph. More than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia. Local leaders in Savannah, Georgia, were preparing for high water in case Debby stalls out over the city. An official in Charleston, South Carolina, says Debby could be a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event.\"\n\nGoogle illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. After reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\nEx-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people charged in the case have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Rudy Giuliani at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She had pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.\n\nRally dates are set.

The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.\n\nKamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.\n\nIn Israel and Lebanon, life goes on even as the region teeters on the edge of all-out war\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- In Beirut, shops are open and traffic is as snarled as ever. In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches. Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Everyone expects that an all-out war would be far more devastating than any previous conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nBangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.\n\nSupreme Court shuts down Missouri's long shot push to lift Trump's gag order in hush-money case\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court has shut down a long-shot push from Missouri seeking to remove a gag order in former President Donald Trump's hush-money case and delay his sentencing in New York. The decision comes Monday after the Missouri attorney general had argued in the unusual request that the New York gag order wrongly limits what the GOP presidential nominee could say on the campaign trail and Trump's eventual sentence could affect his ability to travel. New York countered that the limited gag order does allow Trump to talk about the issues important to voters, and the sentence may not affect his movement at all.\n\nWhat's the deal with the Olympics?

(Charly Triballeau/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nU.S. stocks took a nosedive on Monday amid a worldwide stock market selloff as fears of a possible U.S. recession have mounted in recent days.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1,033.99 to close at 38,703, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 3.43 percent and closed at 16,200. The S&P 500 slid 3 percent.\n\nAlready on Monday, Japan's Nikkei 225 index nosedived about 12 percent, the worst rout in its history, Japan's Topix index fell 12.2 percent. Yields on U.S. government bonds hit multi-month lows, with the 10-year note last at 3.68 percent, while the two-year slipped to 3.69 percent.\n\nA weak jobs report from the U.S. Department of Labor last week coupled with shrinking manufacturing activity in the world's largest economy as well as dismal forecasts from top U.S. technology companies pushed the Nasdaq 100 lower as well.\n\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs also noted the Fed's ability to boost market optimism, estimating a 25 percent likelihood of a U.S. recession, whereas JPMorgan analysts were more bearish, assigning a 50 percent probability to a recession. \"Now that the Fed looks to be materially behind the curve, we expect a [basis points] cut at the September meeting, followed by another 50 [basis points] cut in November,\" said economist Michael Feroli.\n\nMajor Wall Street brokerages also revised their Federal Reserve rate projections for 2024 to show greater policy easing by the central bank.\n\n\"I don't think the Fed would go 50 basis points because at the same time it would imply that the Fed was wrong, that a recession is right around the corner and it would do more to increase investor tension than it would to calm nerves,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. \"If anything, I would say that the Fed might engage in an intra meeting, easing of 25 basis points to let the markets know that it is on top of the issue.\"\n\nOn Monday morning, Chicago Fed President Austan Goosbee said in a CNBC segment that the U.S. central bank would react to signs of weakness in the economy, indicating that interest rates are too high.\n\n\"The Fed's job is very straightforward, maximize employment, stabilize prices and maintain financial stability. That's what we're going to do,\" Goosbee said during CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" show. \"We're forward-looking about it. So if the conditions collectively start coming in like that on the through line, there's deterioration on any of those parts, we're going to fix it.\"\n\nOn Aug. 2, the Labor Department said that nonfarm payrolls increased by 114,000 and the unemployment rate increased to 4.3, worse than expected.\n\nBut Goosbee said that he does not believe the numbers forecast a recession. \"Jobs numbers came in weaker than expected, but [are] not looking yet like recession,\" he said on the program. \"I do think you want to be forward-looking of where the economy is headed for making the decisions.\"\n\nIf the United States enters recession territory, it could roil the already tumultuous 2024 presidential election, which has already seen an assassination attempt and the leading Democrat candidate, President Joe Biden, suspend his reelection campaign in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris. Former President Donald Trump has already deployed messaging related to the U.S. economy and will likely do so as the November election nears.\n\nReacting to the stock market drop, the former president suggested on his Truth Social platform that the current presidential administration is to blame. \"I told you so!\" he wrote in an all-capitalized message.\n\nThe Dow Jones's worst drop in history in terms of points came during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, in early 2020. At that time, it plunged 2,997 points on March 16, 2020, or 12.9 percent.\n\nOther than the Great Depression's start in 1929, the worst U.S. stock market crash came on Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones plunged 22.6 percent in what is now known as \"Black Monday.\"","Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia greeting Nene Sakite of Lower Manya Krobo during his tour of the constituency\n\nThe atmosphere in the Asuogyaman, Lower Manya and Yilo Krobo constituencies was electrifying when the flagbearer of the ruling New Patriotic Party, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, visited them.\n\nUnlike in the past, thousands of people trooped to the various meeting grounds to listen to the message of Dr. Bawumia amidst cheers and applause.\n\nThe unprecedented crowd were treated to various songs composed by different musicians for the NPP's 2024 campaign which has kicked off in earnest.\n\nThe Vice President used the occasion to explain to the mammoth crowd his policy proposals and urged them to vote for not only him as president but the parliamentary candidates on the ticket of the NPP.\n\nDr. Bawumia emphasized that a vote for him would translate into \"bold solutions,\" while a vote for his main opponent, former President John Mahama, meant \"a vote for old solutions.\"\n\nDr. Bawumia highlighted his achievements as Vice President, including resolving generational issues, and promised to do more as president.\n\nHe outlined his new ideas and bold solutions, such as a new tax system, training one million young Ghanaians in coding and software applications, revising the National Service Scheme, and implementing a Ghana Card for passport policy.\n\nThe NPP Flagbearer also compared the records of the NPP and NDC, showcasing the NPP's superior achievements in education, economic indicators, healthcare, tourism, sports infrastructure, digitalization, and more.\n\nHe highlighted the NPP's flagship programs, including Free SHS, One District One Ambulance, expanded health insurance, free basic education and school feeding, District Road Improvement Program, LEAP, and reinstated nurses and teacher training allowances.\n\nDr Bawumia also emphasized the NPP's commitment to security, recruitment of over 30,000 personnel, and the One District One Factory initiative, which has created jobs and stimulated local economies.\n\nHe urged the party's rank and file to work hard to win the 2024 presidential election and parliamentary majority.\n\nDr. Bawumia's message was clear: he is the candidate with bold solutions for Ghana's future, and the NPP has a proven track record of transforming the lives of Ghanaians across the country.\n\n\"We are poised to vote for the NPP this time around because we believe Bawumia has the solutions that can change the destiny of this country,\" a young lady who had come to witness the event stated.\n\nAnother constituent had this to say: \"The number of people who came out to see Dr. Bawumia are extraordinary huge. It has never happened here before that NPP will be here and you see all these people coming out. Things will definitely change for the party in the December elections\".","*Editor's note: On March 4, 2022, Russia enacted a law that criminalizes public opposition to, or independent news reporting about, the war in Ukraine.

It punishes anyone found to spread \"false information\" about the invasion with up to 15 years in prison.\n\nVitaliy Ryumshin discusses why Joe Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race does not change the balance of power in the U.S.\n\nThere have been some surprising developments in the U.S. presidential race. In an unprecedented move, President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the race on July 21, just a few weeks before he was expected to become the Democratic Party's nominee. This decision came after a Democratic uprising following Biden's poor showing in a televised debate with Donald Trump. Subsequently, many of the president's allies pushed him to drop out. Biden resisted until the last moment, but eventually, he was forced to step aside when nearly the entire Democratic leadership turned against him.\n\nWhile the Democratic camp was in disarray, the situation significantly improved for Trump. First, the Republican nominee prevailed over his opponent in the debate, and then the U.S. Supreme Court issued favorable rulings in several major criminal cases Trump faces. Following this, Trump miraculously escaped assassination and spoke at a triumphant Republican National Convention just two days later. Adding to this, Biden is now out of the race. So, it seems that nothing can stop Trump from returning to the White House.\n\nBut is that really the case? Well, if you're a Trump fan, you're in for a disappointment: Biden's departure does not guarantee his opponent will be reelected.\n\nIndeed, the former president still faces many problems. Trump is enmeshed in never-ending scandals, his approval rating remains stubbornly low, and he has failed to unite the country, although recently, he seemed to make some progress toward that end. Moreover, in May and June, people had hoped that the former president had matured politically. After all, Trump reconciled with moderate Republicans, attended the Libertarian Party convention, and aligned himself with the Silicon Valley tech giants who had previously supported the Democrats. However, it all crumbled when he named radical Trumpist Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance as his running mate. That's when it became clear that for Trump, ideological affinity and personal loyalty were still more important than political shrewdness.\n\nSo far, Trump has been able to cleverly hide his incompetence behind Biden's shortcomings. Indeed, Biden had behaved strangely at public events and, at times, made utterly no sense. America talked about nothing other than Biden's deteriorating health, which was getting worse by the month. Against this backdrop, an upbeat Trump looked like a worthy alternative.\n\nNow that Biden is no longer in the race, his vice president, Kamala Harris, is getting ready to run against the Republican nominee. She is a relatively young (59-year-old) Black woman with Indian ancestry. People consider her modern enough to become a TikTok phenomenon and she is relatively popular with independent voters, minorities and young people. In contrast, Trump now seems like America's grandfather in chief, someone who should retire.\n\nTrump needs to offer voters more than just the promise of clear thinking and staying healthy if he is to maintain his momentum.\n\nMeanwhile, the Democrats are also facing challenges. They made a significant mistake by fully committing to a risky Biden nomination, which almost caused a rift in the party. However, after dealing with this crisis, the Democratic Party has pinned its hopes on Harris, a highly questionable candidate.\n\nIndeed, Harris has many shortcomings. She lacks charisma and public speaking skills, and her speeches are word salads. Her awkward jokes and uncontrollable laughter have turned her into a meme.\n\nMoreover, her track record is far from perfect. Harris unsuccessfully ran for president in 2019, losing in the Democratic primaries due to a poorly organized campaign. As vice president, she struggled to handle the immigrant crisis and alienated 90% of her staff with her toxic behavior. In the last few years, Harris' role has been reduced to occasionally standing in for Biden at events he didn't wish to attend.\n\nTherefore, by all accounts, Harris should never have become a successful politician. Americans seem to agree. Her approval rating is lower than Biden's, and her disapproval rating is comparable to Trump's. However, despite her shortcomings, Democrats have consistently promoted her within the party, possibly because she is the ultimate diversity, equity and inclusion candidate.\n\nNow Harris is faced with the challenge of reviving the Democratic presidential campaign as quickly as possible. This includes selecting a running mate, distancing herself from Biden, and combating racism and sexism, which are deeply ingrained in American society. Accomplishing this will require precise and well-coordinated efforts from a large team, significant funding, and minimal mistakes from Harris herself. While she will have access to the necessary resources, there are concerns about whether, given her track record, Harris will use them effectively. It's important to note that Harris did not independently participate in the primaries, which may lead some to think of her as the candidate no one chose.\n\nAs such, the crucial point is that what appeared to be significant changes in American politics have not produced any actual results.\n\nThe U.S. presidential election may change in its details, but the general situation remains the same. It's a contest between the bad and the worst, between the intolerable and the incompetent. And whoever wins the 2024 presidential election won't necessarily be the one who most deserves it, but the one who disgraces themselves the least.","Putting some context data together before a video that should concern everyone.\n\nRepresentative Jamie Raskin's (U-MD) son, Tommy Raskin killed himself right after the 2020 election at the age of 25.

The storm made landfall on the gulf coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 65 mph. More than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia. At least four storm-related deaths have been reported.

The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. After reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\nEx-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case.

After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election.

Such scenes may seem surreal in a region teetering on the edge of all-out war -- and beneath the surface there is plenty of fear and anxiety. But after 10 months of near-daily border skirmishes, strikes further afield and escalating threats, a sense of fatalism seems to have set in. The killings last week of two militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran -- attributed to Israel -- brought vows of revenge from Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah.

Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change.

It was an electoral avalanche,\" the two continued. \"Now it's up to all of us to respect the voice of the people.\"\n\nResidents try to block a street to protest the official results the day after the presidential election as National Guards work to remove them in Caracas, Venezuela, Monday, July 29, 2024. (AP Photo/Fernando Vergara)\n\nAuthorities have declared Maduro the victor in last Sunday´s election but have yet to produce voting tallies to prove he won. The opposition claims to have collected records from more than 80% of the 30,000 polling booths nationwide showing it won.\n\nMaduro announced Saturday that the government has arrested 2,000 opponents and at a rally in Caracas he pledged to detain more people and send them to prison. The post-electoral uprising has also claimed at least 11 deaths, according to Foro Penal, a Caracas-based human rights group.\n\nGonzález and Machado in their missive called on Venezuelans with family members serving in the security forces to urge their loved ones not to attack protesters and obey illegal orders. It said it would offer \"guarantees\" to soldiers who follow the constitution even while promising there would be no impunity for those behind abuses and following illegal orders.\n\nBoth González, a former diplomat, and Machado - who was barred by the government from running - have gone into hiding, saying they fear they will be arrested or killed. Maduro and his cadres have threatened to lock them both up.\n\nAs Venezuelans fight Maduro on the streets, pressure is also building internationally for the Venezuelan government to publish the full breakdown of the electoral results.\n\nBut so far, Maduro has instead asked the country's supreme court - which like all institutions in Venezuela is packed with loyalists - to review any claims of irregularities.\n\n\"Respect for popular sovereignty is what moves us to defend the transparency of the (election) results,\" Brazil´s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said Monday in a press conference alongside fellow leftist President Gabriel Boric of Chile.\n\nBoric, who cast doubt on Maduro´s victory claim in an unexpectedly strong statement within hours of Venezuela´s July 28 election, told reporters that he and Lula discussed the situation in Venezuela on Monday, without elaborating. The leaders did not take questions and their carefully worded statements signaled how leftist leaders in the region are gingerly trying to show respect for Venezuela's sovereignty while voicing doubts about the official results.\n\nA few of Maduro´s staunch allies - including Russia, China and Cuba - have applauded his victory. On Monday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian held a telephone call with Maduro and reiterated his congratulations and \"condemned any foreign interference in Venezuela´s internal affairs,\" Pezeshkian´s office said.\n\n-\n\nAP Writers Joshua Goodman in Miami and Isabel DeBre in Buenos Aires, Argentina, contributed to this report.\n\nMilitary personnel help assist an elderly voter during the presidential election in Caracas, Venezuela, Sunday, July 28, 2024.

(AP Photo/Matias Delacroix)","Jacob Chansley at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, wearing horned headdress and carrying spear (Win McNamee/Getty Images).\n\nWith roughly 90 days to go until the 2024 presidential election, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Monday has agreed to give a spear and horned headdress back to convicted Jan. 6 rioter Jacob Chansley, also known as the \"QAnon Shaman.\"\n\nAs Law&Crime previously reported, Chansley asked that the federal government \"return forthwith all property seized\" in connection with his arrest for breaching the U.S. Capitol. He also sought to reduce his period of supervised release from three years to 12 months. Prosecutors said while they did not believe the items should be returned because they were still considered evidence, if they gave them back, it would mean Chansley must assure the court there would be no further challenges to his criminal conviction.\n\nIn a 6-page order on Monday, Senior U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth wrote:\n\nDefendant Jacob Anthony Chansley stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021. In that respect, he was like thousands of others that day. But he stood out to the entire world because of his \"unmistakable outfit\" of \"a horned coyote-tail headdress; red, white, and blue face paint; gloves; and no shirt.\" [Citation omitted] In addition, he had armed himself with a serious weapon: \"a six-foot pole with an American flag ziptied to the shaft and a metal spearhead fixed to the top.\"\n\nMr. Chansley has completed his prison sentence and much of his term of supervised release. Now, he has moved for the return of his property seized and still held by the government, including his spear and helmet. Since the government has not established that it still needs these items as evidence and has not sought their forfeiture, the Court will GRANT Mr. Chansley's motion.\n\nChansley was sentenced in November 2021 to 41 months in prison and 36 months supervised release. Originally facing six charges, he struck a plea deal and pleaded guilty to only one count: obstruction of an official proceeding, a charge recently narrowed by the U.S. Supreme Court in Fischer v. United States.\n\nAll told, Chansley was incarcerated for 11 months before being released to a halfway house in March 2023 so he could start his supervised release program. When he tried to end that early, prosecutors reminded Lamberth that though the judge was effusive with his praise of Chansley at sentencing -- he had called Chansley's mea culpa \"the most remarkable I've heard in 34 years\" and \"akin to the kind of thing Martin Luther King would have said\" -- it was just two years after that when the judge expressed a certain degree of buyer's remorse.\n\nLamberth had learned that Chansley gave interviews to the press that were a far cry from contrite; the defendant said that he regretted pleading guilty.\n\nLamberth acknowledged this in his Monday order as well as Chansley's subsequent appeal. That appeal didn't go far because Chansley withdrew it. But he then he moved to vacate his sentence, claiming he had new evidence to vindicate himself and further, that he had \"ineffective assistance of his plea counsel.\"\n\nThat motion was denied and the judge reminded Chansley of that fact on Monday -- as well as his prior \"disappointment that 'Mr. Chansley has recanted the contrition displayed at his sentencing.'\"\n\nIn a footnote of the order, Lamberth notably included a snippet of Chansley's statement from sentencing that had so moved the judge and came back to bite him later:\n\nSo I had to come to terms with the fact that I was in solitary confinement because of me, because of my decision. I broke the law, and if I believe in freedom, if I believe in law and order, if I believe in responsibility and accountability, then that means that I should do what Gandhi would do and take responsibility even and especially when it incriminates me,\" Chansley said at sentencing. \"No ifs, ands, or buts about it. That's what men of honor do. I am truly, truly repentant for my actions, because repentance is not just saying you're sorry. Repentance is apologizing and then moving in the exact opposite direction of the sin that you committed. And that's what I've been trying to do ever since I realized the magnitude of my error and the magnitude of my mistake. [I]n retrospect, I would do everything differently on January 6. In all honesty, I would do everything differently.\n\nThough the \"QAnon Shaman\" will have his iconic spear and fur-lined helmet back, Lamberth was silent on Chansley's July request for an early release from supervised probation.\n\nInstead, the judge said only that the government had failed to establish why Chansley's property was \"evidence\" at this stage and that it was not clear to him \"how Mr. Chansley could contest his conviction, as he has been sentenced, abandoned his direct appeal, and seen his § 2255 motion denied.\"\n\n\"But even if the government may need to reprove Mr. Chansley's guilt, the government has not explained why it would need his property,\" Lamberth wrote, adding that it was not enough for prosecutors to suggest the government may \"eventually\" seek civil forfeiture.\n\nWhile Chansley was the \"face of the riot,\" the judge wrote, and \"images of him at the Capitol on that day abound,\" three years have passed and prosecutors have \"never sought forfeiture of the property involved in the Capitol siege.\"\n\n\"As there is voluminous video and photo evidence of Mr. Chansley's conduct, his property is of little utility for an investigation or prosecution and 'the United States' legitimate interests can be satisfied even if the property is returned ... The Court therefore finds that the retention of Mr. Chansley's property would be unreasonable,\" the judge wrote.\n\nProsecutors may have an \"interest\" in using \"the evidence of its choice,\" such as a weapon used to commit an offense, he added, and \"the government may well have been able to articulate a compelling reason to retain Mr. Chansley's property.\"\n\n\"But when the government has vast amounts of other evidence, it cannot defeat a Rule 41(g) motion simply by asserting its desire to retain the evidence without giving any reasons,\" the judge wrote.","Former President Donald Trump has suggested using Bitcoin or a \"crypto check\" to address the United States' staggering $35 trillion national debt.\n\nDuring an interview on Fox News, Trump, the Republican Party's 2024 presidential nominee, praised the crypto industry and warned that America must innovate in the digital asset space to keep pace with other countries.\n\nHe even highlighted the potential role of Bitcoin in resolving the national debt crisis.\n\n\"Who knows, maybe we'll pay off our $35 trillion dollar [national debt], hand them a little crypto check, right? We'll hand them a little Bitcoin and wipe away our $35 trillion,\" he stated.\n\nUS Government Faces Mounting Debt\n\nThe former president's proposal comes at a time when the US government is facing significant challenges due to its mounting debt.\n\nThe continuous devaluation of the dollar, driven by excessive currency printing to service outstanding debts, has contributed to Bitcoin's rising value relative to fiat currency.\n\nTo illustrate the gravity of the situation, it took around 200 years for the US national debt to reach $1 trillion.\n\nToday, the same amount is added to the debt approximately every three months due to deficit spending.\n\nIn June, about 76% of all income tax revenue was used to pay interest on the debt, making it one of the largest expenses in the US fiscal budget.\n\nBitcoin, with its supply-capped nature, could potentially siphon value from the current US dollar system, thereby averting a full-blown currency collapse similar to the Weimar Republic in the early 20th century.\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has also echoed this sentiment, suggesting that establishing a Bitcoin reserve could help the government pay off its national debt as Bitcoin appreciates in value.\n\nLummis Proposes Bitcoin as Strategic Reserve\n\nMoreover, Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced a bill to establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve in the United States.\n\nThe initiative aims to counteract the negative effects of rampant monetary printing and preserve the US's financial dominance in global markets and trade.\n\nThe Wyoming Senator has proposed that the US Treasury acquire 5% of Bitcoin's total supply and hold the decentralized asset for at least 20 years as a safeguard against monetary devaluation by the Federal Reserve and poor fiscal policy.\n\nNotably, Trump's stance on cryptocurrencies has evolved over time.\n\nDespite previously criticizing Bitcoin as a \"scam,\" he has recently changed his tune.\n\nOn June 14, he declared that he would end the Biden administration's \"war on crypto\" if elected president.\n\nTrump had also previously criticized Biden for his harsh stance on cryptocurrencies, emphasizing that the United States should strive to be a leader in the crypto industry.\n\nAs reported, a survey conducted by the Harris Poll has revealed that one in three voters in the US consider a candidate's position on cryptocurrencies before making their voting decision.\n\nAnother survey conducted by leading crypto venture capital firm Paradigm reveals that Trump's poll numbers for the 2024 US Presidential Election enjoy significant support from the crypto community.","Since 1908, the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc. and its members have made their marks across several industries and impacted communities and spaces.\n\nSome influential members include Phylicia Rashad, Coretta Scott King, Rosa Parks, Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison, and Vice President Kamala Harris, according to ESSENCE.\n\nHarris was officially sworn in as vice president of the United States on Jan. 20, 2021, making her the first woman, Black person, and South Asian American to be elected to the office. While this historical marker is noteworthy, it was not the beginning of her story.\n\nA native of Oakland, CA, Harris' roots in education and public service start with the influence of her mother, Shyamala Gopalan. According to a profile from the White House, Gopalan earned her doctorate in 1964, the same year Harris was born, and worked as a breast cancer scientist.\n\nHarris' father, Donald J. Harris, came to the United States from Jamaica to study economics at the University of California, Berkeley. He is currently a professor emeritus of economics at Stanford University.\n\nInfluenced by her mother and father's academic work, Harris graduated from Westmount High School near Montreal, Canada, where she moved with her mother after her parents divorced. Harris then began her collegiate studies back in the U.S. at Howard University. Attending one of the country's HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) was likely influenced by the cultural and social upbringings of her parents.\n\nIn her memoir, \"The Truths We Hold: An American Journey,\" she discusses her parents' work and participation during the Civil Rights movement as well as her mother's acknowledgment of raising her and her sister, Maya, as Black girls in America.\n\n\"My mother understood very well that she was raising two Black daughters,\" Harris wrote in the memoir. \"She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as Black girls, and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud Black women.\"\n\nDuring her time at the HBCU, Harris was affiliated with the College of Arts and Sciences Student Council, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc., and the debate team, per a Howard University profile.\n\nHarris majored in political science and economics, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1986. She described her time at Howard as critical, naming them her \"formative years.\"\n\n\"The thing that Howard taught me is that you can do any collection of things and not one thing to the exclusion of the other. You could be homecoming queen and valedictorian. There are no false choices at Howard,\" Harris stated via a Howard University profile.\n\nUpon graduating from Howard, Harris attended law school at the University of California Hastings, College of Law.\n\nWhile there in February 1989, Harris advocated for Black students after a Black History Month display was defaced with racial slurs. According to Politico, Harris stood before approximately 300 students, faculty, and staff, detailing the incident and demanding change.\n\nHer law school education led her to become a prosecutor, state attorney general, U.S. senator of California, and vice president of the United States.\n\nHarris is running a historic campaign for president of the United States. After President Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential election, Harris took over his campaign operation, leading to a surge in donations.\n\nAccording to a separate Politico report, Harris' Democratic campaign now has $377 million in cash on hand, which is $50 million more than the Trump campaign.\n\nMorehouse College alumni called the 1867 PAC. Additionally, Harris has experienced an uptick in support from members of the Divine Nine, which consist of the nine recognized Black Greek-letter organizations (BGLOs).\n\nAccording to Inside Higher Ed, BGLO members, particularly Alpha Kappa Alpha, have rallied behind the vice president's campaign for president.\n\nA large number of AKA members joined a 44,000-person Zoom call. The group, Win With Black Women, organized the gathering on the day President Biden withdrew from the presidential race. During this meeting, the organization raised $1.5 million for the Harris campaign, according to The New York Times.","Stocks tumbled over fears of a U.S. economic slowdown\n\nA wave of anxiety rippled through financial markets yesterday. Stocks fell in the U.S. and around the world as investors zeroed in on signs of a slowing American economy.\n\nThe drop extended a sell-off that began on Friday after the U.S. released a jobs report that showed the highest level of unemployment in nearly three years. This deepened fears that the world's largest economy could be headed for slower growth.\n\nIn the U.S., the S&P 500 fell 3 percent, its worst day since September 2022. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index dropped 12.4 percent, its biggest one-day point decline. The FTSE 100, Britain's benchmark index, had its worst day since July 2023, falling just over 2 percent.\n\nThere were other factors at play in the plunge: concerns that tech stocks had run up too far, too fast, and that a strengthening yen could hurt the prospects of Japanese companies and some global traders. In the U.S., some questioned whether the Federal Reserve may have waited too long before cutting interest rates. Here's the latest on the market meltdown.\n\nTime to sell? It's tough to do nothing during this kind of market turmoil. But in this case, it's your best option, Ron Lieber, our Your Money columnist, writes.\n\nBangladesh's leader resigned and fled\n\nCrowds celebrated in the streets of Dhaka, the capital, yesterday after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country. The army chief said the military would oversee the formation of an interim government.\n\nHasina was forced out by weeks of protests that began peacefully and then transformed into deadly clashes with security forces. Almost 100 people were reported killed on Sunday, the deadliest day of the unrest.\n\nResponding to the bloodshed, the protesters marched to Hasina's residence. Hasina fled in a helicopter, and a crowd stormed the building. Looters made off with furniture, bedding and potted plants. Hasina's current location isn't clear. She has family in both the U.S. and Britain.\n\nHere's the latest.\n\nBackground: Hasina, 76, was one of the world's longest-serving female leaders. Under her rule, the economy grew quickly and the country saw rapid development. But she also jailed her political opponents and was criticized as an authoritarian.\n\nWhat's next: Her departure doesn't guarantee easy days ahead. The process of agreeing on an interim government could be bumpy, Mujib Mashal, our South Asia bureau chief, writes.\n\n🇺🇸 U.S. ELECTION 2024\n\nThe presidential election is less than 100 days away.

The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed a 12.4% plunge for Japan's Nikkei 225, its worst since 1987. Treasury yields pared their losses after a report showed U.S. services businesses are continuing to grow.

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby is slamming Florida with catastrophic flooding and could bring potentially record-setting rain to Georgia and South Carolina. The storm made landfall on the gulf coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 65 mph. More than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia. At least four storm-related deaths have been reported.

Some of those postings were menacing in nature including one claiming the 59-year-old politician would regret running for the presidency after he plucked \"out her eyes with a pair of pliers.\"\n\nCarillo is also accused of threatening to shoot anyone who tried to protect Harris in that July 27 post.\n\nAnother comment on the suspect's GETTER account calls for someone to incinerate the Democratic candidate.\n\n\"Kamala Harris needs to be put on fire alive,\" he wrote the same day, according to a Friday court filing. \"I will do it personally if no one else does it. I want her to suffer a slow agonizing death.\"\n\nAlso last week, Carillo allegedly wrote to Harris \"Just for being a Democrat you're going to die.\"\n\nLaw enforcement officers said in an affidavit they found a rifle and a handgun in the suspect's home Winchester, Virginia, home during a search last week. When police came to Carillo's door, he reportedly asked if their visit was \"about the online stuff\" and didn't deny posting the messages.\n\nThe 2024 presidential election is shaping up to be highly contentious. Republican candidate Donald Trump has recently escalated his attempts to draw attention to Harris being a woman of color.\n\nHe's also planted the seed that, if he loses in November, it will be because the election was somehow rigged. He made that same false assertion after being defeated handily by President Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nDays before the Republican National Committee made Trump its presidential candidate for third straight time last month, a Pennsylvania gunman fired several shots at the 78-year-old Queens native at a rally, wounding the nominee's ear.\n\nIt remains unclear why the shooter, a 20-year-old registered Republican, attempted to assassinate the party's representative to lead the country.\n\nHarris put out a statement condemning the \"abhorrent act\" that nearly killed her opponent.\n\n©2024 New York Daily News. Visit at nydailynews.com. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.","The crucial battleground state has been chosen as the location for her first big public event following the announcement of her running mate in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nDemocrats view Pennsylvania as a critical state for Harris. Although she could win the election without it, Pennsylvania's 19 Electoral College votes would give her a much easier path to the 270 needed to defeat former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe state is roughly divided between Democrats and Republicans, backing Trump in 2016 but flipping back to Democrats to support President Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nHarris emerged as the Democratic presidential nominee after Biden withdrew from the race last month amid pressure from Democrats concerned about polls showing Trump leading key states, including Pennsylvania. Biden's poll numbers slipped following his debate against Trump in June, which fueled concerns about his age and ability to win in November.\n\nFor months, Harris polled similarly, or behind Biden. But her ascent to the top of the ticket sparked a wave of Democratic enthusiasm, and fundraising, that has shifted polls in her direction, giving Democrats more confidence about their ability to win.\n\nA new poll of Pennsylvania voters released on Monday showed Trump trailing Harris in the Keystone State.\n\nThe GQR poll found Harris leading Trump by four percentage pints (50 percent to 46 percent). Two percent of respondents said they were leaning toward other candidates, and another two percent remained undecided, according to the survey.\n\nIt polled 500 likely voters from July 26 to July 30, 2024 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.38 percentage points.\n\nThe poll comes as Harris is set to hold a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday with her running mate, who is yet to be announced. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro is viewed as a front-runner to become her vice presidential candidate, due largely to his electoral success in the state in past elections.\n\nOther polls have pointed to a tight race since Harris became the Democratic nominee. On Monday, FiveThirtyEight's polling aggregate showed the two candidates nearly tied, with Harris receiving average support of 45.3 percent and Trump averaging 44.4 percent.\n\nA Fabrizio, Lee & Associates poll, conducted among 600 likely voters from July 29 to August 1, found the race tied. In a two-way race, each received 48 percent. When Kennedy was included, they each received 45 percent support, according to the poll.\n\nMeanwhile, a Public Policy Polling survey, conducted among 627 registered voters from July 29 to 30, found Trump with a 1-point lead (48 percent to 47 percent).\n\nA Public Opinion Strategies poll, conducted among 400 likely voters from July 23 to 29, found Harris with a 3-point lead (48 percent to 45 percent).\n\nNewsweek reached out to the Harris and Trump campaigns for comment via email.\n\nHarris and her running mate are expected to travel to the key swing states this week to continue building enthusiasm, as well as winning over undecided swing voters who could determine the outcome of the election.\n\nIn addition to Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina and Wisconsin are viewed as the most competitive states. Biden won all but North Carolina in 2020.\n\nBiden carried Pennsylvania by only 1.2 points in 2020, winning 50 percent of the vote to Trump's 48.8 percent. In 2016, Trump won by an even smaller margin, winning 48.2 percent of the vote compared to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's 47.5 percent.","The atmosphere in the Asuogyaman, Lower Manya and Yilo Krobo constituencies was electrifying when the flagbearer of the ruling New Patriotic Party, Dr. Mahaamudu Bawumia, visited them.\n\nUnlike in the past, thousands of people trooped to the various meeting grounds to listen to the message of Dr. Bawumia amidst cheers and applause.\n\nThe unprecedented crowd were treated to various songs composed by different musicians for the NPP's 2024 campaign which has kicked off in earnest.\n\nThe Vice President used the occasion to explain to the mammoth crowds his policy proposals and urged them to vote for not only him as president but the parliamentary candidates on the ticket of the NPP.\n\nDr. Bawumia emphasized that a vote for him would translate into \"bold solutions,\" while a vote for his main opponent, former President John Mahama, meant \"a vote for old solutions.\"\n\nDr. Bawumia highlighted his achievements as Vice President, including resolving generational issues, and promised to do more as president.\n\nHe outlined his new ideas and bold solutions, such as a new tax system, training one million young Ghanaians in coding and software applications, revising the National Service Scheme, and implementing a Ghana Card for passport policy.\n\nThe NPP Flagbearer also compared the records of the NPP and NDC, showcasing the NPP's superior achievements in education, economic indicators, healthcare, tourism, sports infrastructure, digitalization, and more.\n\nHe highlighted the NPP's flagship programs, including Free SHS, One District One Ambulance, expanded health insurance, free basic education and school feeding, District Road Improvement Program, LEAP, and reinstated nurses and teacher training allowances.\n\nDr Bawumia also emphasized the NPP's commitment to security, recruitment of over 30,000 personnel, and the One District One Factory initiative, which has created jobs and stimulated local economies.\n\nHe urged the party's rank and file to work hard to win the 2024 presidential election and parliamentary majority.\n\nDr. Bawumia's message was clear: he is the candidate with bold solutions for Ghana's future, and the NPP has a proven track record of transforming the lives of Ghanaians across the country.\n\n\"We are poised to vote for the NPP this time around because we believe Bawumia has the solutions that can change the destiny of this country\" a young lady who had come to witness the event stated.\n\nAnother constituent had this to say: \"The number of people who came out to see Dr. Bawumia are extraordinary huge. It has never happened here before that NPP will be here and you see all these people coming out. Things will definitely change for the party in the December elections\".","Google told House Republicans that various bugs prevented information about Donald Trump from auto-completing when users tried to search for information about the former president or the assassination attempt against him. The search engine also claimed those bugs caused searches for Trump to generate articles about Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, wrote Monday that the committee would meet with Google staff this week over concerns that \"Google may now be interfering in the 2024 presidential election by censoring information about former President Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"Alphabet also admitted to the Committee and Select Subcommittee that Autocomplete was not showing President Trump's name in response to searches for 'President Donald' and similar terms. Alphabet claims 'that this particular issue was caused by a bug' and has been fixed by a recent update,\" Jordan wrote, in reference to Google's parent company.\n\nJordan called it a \"vague excuse\" and told Google to prepared to answer more specific questions, including \"How can the American people be confident that a similar issue, whether intentional or not, will not occur again?\"\n\nWATCH MICHAEL KNOWLES' INTERVIEW WITH 'GOOGLE'S WORST NIGHTMARE'\n\nThe commitee's letter to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said that Google had finally corrected the issue, where searching for information about attempted assassinations would return results about attempts on other presidents, but not Trump's.\n\nThe company faulted \"built-in protections around political violence\" that were \"out of date.\" Regardless of the cause, search results were impacted from the July 13th shooting through at least July 29. Google told The Daily Wire at the time that, while the bug suppressed auto-complete, users could still access information about the assassination attempt by searching manually.\n\nBut even manual searches for Trump frequently \"returned news labels and stories about Vice President Harris,\" Jordan wrote.\n\n\"Alphabet claimed that this error was the result of its algorithm that automatically generates and displays labels about news topics related to a Google Search inquiry,\" Jordan wrote, noting that the company claimed search results \"may be unexpected or imperfect, and bugs will occur.\"\n\nJordan suggested that the errors tended to favor one political party, asking \"Does the company seek to elevate liberal news outlets more prominently over conservative outlets in order to favor Democratic candidates? If not, what steps does the company take to audit how the algorithm is functioning?\"\n\nJordan said Google has an ongoing obligation to produce to Congress documents pursuant to a February 2023 subpoena, even if the documents were created after the subpoena was received.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee has investigated political bias among big tech companies and digital advertisers, saying that an advertising association known as the Global Alliance for Responsible Media might have violated anti-trust laws by discouraging companies from advertising with conservative media sources and purporting to speak with one voice on behalf of advertisers in order to leverage changes in tech platforms that helped Democrats.","In an interview with Lex Fridman, Elon Musk explained why he endorsed Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\"What's your philosophy behind that endorsement?

This development has sparked a whirlwind of activity within the Democratic Party as Harris seeks to solidify her position by selecting a running mate. Endorsements from influential figures like former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have bolstered her campaign, adding pressure to her upcoming decision. With an announcement expected by August 7, Harris and her team are meticulously vetting a range of potential candidates, each bringing unique strengths and challenges.\n\nHarris is currently vetting several prominent Democrats for the vice-presidential slot. The candidates under consideration include Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Recently, Michigan Senator Gary Peters' name has also surfaced. Each of these individuals brings unique strengths and challenges to the table, and Harris' choice will reflect her strategic priorities for the campaign.\n\nHarris faces the monumental task of securing victory in seven key swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. These states are crucial battlegrounds, and her choice of running mate will be scrutinized for its potential to sway voters in these regions.\n\nGovernor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania is a compelling candidate with strong credentials. However, his Jewish heritage could be a double-edged sword, particularly in Michigan, where a significant Arab and Muslim population might view his candidacy with skepticism due to concerns about his stance on Israel. Additionally, Shapiro's support for private school vouchers puts him at odds with public school advocates, which could further complicate his appeal.\n\nSenator Mark Kelly of Arizona is another strong contender, but his potential nomination comes with significant risks. Should Kelly be chosen, he would have to resign from the Senate, allowing the Republican governor of Arizona to appoint a Republican successor. This would tip the balance of power in the Senate, a critical consideration for the Democratic Party.\n\nGovernor Roy Cooper of North Carolina has already withdrawn from consideration, narrowing the field. His decision underscores the complexities and personal calculations involved in the vice-presidential selection process.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is a well-known figure with national recognition. However, his profile and policy positions may not necessarily complement Harris' strengths, raising questions about the overall balance of the ticket.\n\nSenator Gary Peters of Michigan brings a long family history and a solid legislative record. Despite his historical ties and past electoral success, his recent dip in popularity and the narrow margin of his 2020 Senate victory suggest he may not significantly enhance Harris' electoral prospects in key swing states.\n\nGovernor Andy Beshear of Kentucky is noted for his progressive stance on voting rights, having restored the voting rights of over 140,000 former felons. While this move aligns with liberal values, it also raises concerns about the integrity of the voting system, a point that could be exploited by opponents.\n\nGovernor Tim Walz of Minnesota offers limited strategic value in terms of electoral math. Minnesota has consistently voted Democratic since 1972, and there is no clear indication that Walz would bolster Harris' chances in neighboring swing states like Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\nOne of Harris' most significant challenges is finding a running mate who offers ideological balance without alienating the Democratic base or conservative-leaning voters. The current field of candidates largely shares Harris' liberal views on key issues such as abortion rights, marijuana legalization, and gun control. This ideological alignment, while reinforcing party unity, risks alienating moderate and conservative Democrats who may find Trump's platform more appealing.\n\nA notable gap among the potential running mates is the lack of substantial foreign policy and national security experience. In an election where global issues and international relations are likely to be prominent, this deficiency could be a critical weakness. Harris' campaign will need to address these concerns, possibly by emphasizing her own experience and strategic vision on the global stage.\n\nHarris' eventual running mate will have to face Republican VP nominee JD Vance in debates. Vance has proven to be a formidable debater, adept at putting Democrats on the defensive. The Democratic ticket will need a candidate who can effectively counter Vance's attacks and articulate a compelling vision for the future.\n\nThe broader dilemma for the Democratic Party is the balancing act between progressive ideals and broader electoral appeal. The party's shift towards more left-wing policies could energize the base but risks alienating moderate voters. Harris' selection of a running mate will signal the party's strategic direction and its approach to addressing this ideological divide.\n\nAs Harris deliberates her choice, the stakes are high. The selected vice presidential candidate must not only help win crucial swing states but also present a unified front capable of addressing the nation's diverse and complex issues. The decision is further complicated by the need to balance liberal policies with broader electoral appeal.\n\nKamala Harris's vice presidential selection process is a pivotal moment in her campaign. Each potential candidate brings distinct advantages and disadvantages, and the final choice will significantly impact the Democratic Party's chances in the 2024 presidential election. With the announcement deadline looming, all eyes are on Harris as she navigates this critical juncture in her political career.","Dow drops 1,000, and Japanese stocks suffer worst crash since 1987 as markets quake around the world\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly everything on Wall Street is tumbling as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsens and sets off another sell-off for financial markets around the world.

So it was crushing when one of Alaska's Head Start providers closed two of its preschools. The program suffers nationally from a teacher shortage -- its teachers must have college degrees, and they can often earn more working in retail or at local school districts.

This time, it's war\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- For Ukrainian athletes, the Paris Olympics are more than just sports. They're a way to draw attention to their country's fight for survival against Russia -- a sort of war on another battlefield. But an Associated Press analysis found Russia's war is making it increasingly difficult for Ukraine, once a post-Soviet sports power, to get those headline-capturing medals. Ukrainian performances began dipping after 2014, the year of Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea. Ukraine's haul of 11 medals at the 2016 Rio Games was its smallest as an independent nation and it tumbled to a low of 22nd in the country rankings. Ukraine recovered to 16th at the pandemic-delayed Olympics in Tokyo in 2021 but just one of its 19 medals was gold -- another new low.","A soldier carries chairs as election workers prepare polling stations in Caracas, Venezuela, Friday, July 26, 2024. The presidential election is set for July 28.\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's opposition leaders are calling on the country's armed forces to abandon their support of President Nicolás Maduro and stop repressing demonstrators who have come out in force to dispute the leader's claim he prevailed in last Sunday's election.\n\nThe armed forces are traditionally the arbiter of political disputes in Venezuela and have been key to Maduro's grip on power ever since he took over the so-called Bolivarian revolution in 2013 from his mentor, the late Hugo Chávez.","In the wake of President Joe Biden's decision to step aside, the Democratic Party finds itself at a crucial crossroads. As Vice President Kamala Harris emerges as the presumptive nominee for the 2024 presidential election, a complex debate is unfolding within progressive circles. While the threat posed by Republican nominee Donald Trump's potential return to power looms large, some prominent progressives, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, are hesitating to offer their immediate and unconditional endorsement of Harris. This reluctance has sparked criticism from certain quarters, but a closer examination reveals that this measured approach may be both strategically sound and necessary for the long-term health of the progressive movement.\n\nBy resisting calls for unconditional loyalty to party nominees, progressives are advocating for a more dynamic, responsive political system where ideas and policies are vigorously debated, even within party lines.\n\nThe stakes of the 2024 election cannot be overstated. Trump's potential return to the White House is widely viewed as an existential threat to liberal democracy. His previous term was marked by attempts to undermine democratic institutions, a disregard for the rule of law, and the emboldening of far-right extremism. The prospect of a second Trump term, potentially unconstrained by reelection concerns, sends shivers down the spines of many Americans, regardless of their position on the political spectrum.\n\nGiven these high stakes, the impulse to rally behind any Democratic nominee might seem natural. However, such unconditional support could prove counterproductive and potentially damaging to the long-term promotion of a genuine progressive agenda. To understand this perspective, it's essential to examine the delicate balance of power within the Democratic Party and the role that progressive pressure has played in recent years.\n\nThe Biden administration's most celebrated achievements -- from ambitious climate initiatives to student debt relief to massive infrastructure investment -- owe much to the persistent pressure exerted by progressive forces both inside and outside the government. The creation of a strong progressive voting bloc, coupled with grassroots movements and the strategic positioning of left-wing officials in key roles, has been instrumental in pushing the Democratic agenda leftward. These victories were not gifts bestowed by a benevolent party establishment but hard-won concessions extracted through sustained activism and political maneuvering.\n\nThe obvious fear among progressives is that without this constant pressure, the Democratic Party will inevitably gravitate back toward its corporate-friendly, centrist tendencies. Historically, the Democratic Party has maintained close ties with corporate interests and the military-industrial complex. While the party has made strides in recent years to address issues like income inequality and universal healthcare, these efforts often fall far short of the transformative changes needed to address systemic problems.\n\nThe influence of wealthy donors and corporate lobbyists remains a significant concern for progressives. As Sen. Sanders has long pointed out, the replacement of Biden as the nominee could potentially open the floodgates for even greater donor influence over the party's agenda. This fear is not unfounded, as evidenced by growing pressures from certain donors to replace Lina Khan, the current head of the Federal Trade Commission, who has been a leading figure in challenging big tech monopolies.\n\nVice President Harris' political evolution provides a case study in the tensions between progressive ideals and mainstream Democratic politics. As a presidential candidate in 2020, Harris embraced several progressive positions, including banning fracking and significant police reform. However, as she transitions into her role as the presumptive nominee, there are signs of a shift toward more centrist stances. Harris has begun to distance herself from some of her previous progressive positions in order to \"bolster a more moderate image.\" This rightward drift is seen by many as an attempt to court moderate voters and assuage the concerns of corporate donors.\n\nInterestingly, the only area where Harris seems to be maintaining a somewhat progressive stance is on the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Here, she has called for a more balanced approach, aligning with growing pressure from Democratic voters who support Palestinian rights and are demanding a cease-fire. This shift in the party's stance on Israel-Palestine provides a telling example of how progressive pressure can influence party positions. Harris's more nuanced approach, where while reconfirming US support for Israel she has also openly critiqued the number of civilian casualties, stands in contrast to the traditionally staunch pro-Israel stance of the Democratic establishment.\n\nThe fact that Harris has not fully abandoned this more balanced position on Israel-Palestine, even as she moves to the center on other issues, demonstrates the power of sustained progressive advocacy. It also underscores the importance of maintaining pressure on key issues rather than offering blanket support. The growing chorus of Democratic voters, particularly young people and progressives, demanding a ceasefire and a reevaluation of U.S. support for Israeli military actions has clearly had an impact on the party's rhetoric and policy positions.\n\nThe reluctance of some progressives to offer immediate, unconditional endorsement to Harris is not merely about ideological purity. It's a calculated strategy aimed at shaping the Democratic platform and ensuring that progressive priorities remain at the forefront of the party's agenda. By making their support conditional on commitments to key progressive policies, leftist leaders hope to prevent a wholesale abandonment of the transformative vision that has energized millions of voters, particularly young people.\n\nThis approach serves several strategic purposes. By withholding immediate endorsement, progressives retain bargaining power to influence the party platform and Harris's campaign promises. A vigorous debate within the party can actually serve to engage and motivate progressive voters, rather than suppressing turnout through a perception that their concerns are being ignored. Conditional support encourages specific, measurable policy commitments rather than vague platitudes. Moreover, by clearly articulating their expectations now, progressives lay the groundwork for holding a potential Harris administration accountable after the election.\n\nWhile the threat posed by a potential Trump presidency is real and significant, offering unconditional support to any Democratic nominee carries its own set of risks. Without pressure from the left, there's a danger that the Democratic platform could shift even further to the center, abandoning key progressive priorities. Young and progressive voters, who have been crucial to recent Democratic victories, may become disillusioned if they perceive that their concerns are being sidelined. The transition period presents a unique opportunity to push for party reforms and policy commitments, and immediate, unconditional endorsement would squander this chance. Once full endorsement is given, progressives lose much of their leverage to influence the direction of the campaign and potential administration.\n\nThe progressive strategy of conditional support extends beyond mere party politics. It speaks to a broader vision of how democracy should function. By resisting calls for unconditional loyalty to party nominees, progressives are advocating for a more dynamic, responsive political system where ideas and policies are vigorously debated, even within party lines. This approach challenges the notion that party unity must come at the expense of ideological diversity and policy innovation. Instead, it posits that a healthy democracy requires constant negotiation and renegotiation of the social contract, with citizens and their representatives actively shaping the direction of governance.\n\nAs the 2024 election approaches, progressives find themselves walking a tightrope. On one side looms the very real threat of a Trump return to power, with all the democratic backsliding that would entail. On the other side is the risk of seeing hard-won progressive gains eroded by a Democratic Party that, absent continued pressure, may revert to its more corporate-friendly instincts. Withholding immediate, unconditional endorsement of Kamala Harris is not a rejection of the democratic process or an invitation for Trump to win. Rather, it's a sophisticated political strategy aimed at ensuring that the Democratic Party remains responsive to the needs and aspirations of its progressive base. In the end, the progressive movement's strength lies in its ability to both challenge and support the Democratic Party, pushing it toward a more equitable, sustainable, and just vision for America. By maintaining this tension, progressives hope to not just win an election, but to fundamentally transform the political landscape for generations to come.\n\nUltimately, while the strategy of conditional support for Democratic candidates like Kamala Harris serves immediate tactical purposes, it's crucial to recognize that true transformative change ultimately requires building an independent, mass progressive movement. This movement can strategically align with pro-corporate parties like the Democrats when necessary in the short term, but its long-term goal must be to fundamentally reshape the political landscape. By organizing outside traditional party structures, building grassroots power, and cultivating a clear vision for a more egalitarian, sustainable, and free world, progressives can work toward creating a political force that doesn't just influence existing parties, but eventually replaces them with something far better.","Vice President Kamala Harris, grappling with how to keep early 2024 Presidential election momentum alive, is also preparing for a crucial week that includes her most critical decision yet: choosing a running mate.\n\nWhile Harris has secured enough delegates to become the Democratic nominee, delegates still have to participate in a \"virtual roll call\" to solidify her nomination.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a Tuesday night deadline.

Kennedy Jr. arrived at a New York court Monday to fight a lawsuit alleging he falsely claimed to live in New York as he sought to get on the ballot in the state.\n\nKennedy appeared and sat at his attorneys' table during legal arguments Monday morning, ahead of a civil trial expected to start later in the day in the state capital of Albany. Under state election law, a judge is set to decide the case without a jury.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges Kennedy's nominating petition falsely said his residence was in New York's northern suburbs while he actually has lived in Los Angeles since 2014, when he married \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" actor Cheryl Hines.\n\nThe suit seeks to invalidate his petition. The case was brought by Clear Choice PAC, a super PAC led by supporters of Democratic President Joe Biden.\n\nGov.

Google's counsel acknowledged an \"error\" to the committee that showed results for Harris instead of Trump and omitted information about Trump entirely in response to the search \"President Donald,\" claiming it was due to a \"bug.\"\n\nGoogle users began flagging the search result discrepancies in late July when the autocomplete feature for \"assassination attempt\" omitted any information regarding the recent Trump shooting. Users also began noticing that Harris related content was the top search result for Trump related searches, leading some to speculate that the tech platform was intentionally censoring information about Trump.\n\n\"Recent reporting has indicated that Google may now be interfering in the 2024 presidential election by censoring information about former President Donald Trump's ongoing campaign for the presidency, including relating to the July 13 assassination attempt on him in Pennsylvania,\" the letter reads.\n\nAlphabet, a parent company of Google, also admitted to the committee that autocomplete search results had not shown results related to President Trump in response to searches for \"President Donald,\" because of a \"bug\" in their software that has since been fixed by a recent update, the letter says. The committee said this was a \"vague excuse\" that left \"many questions unanswered.\"\n\nThe committee also questioned Pichai about why Google searches for Trump had produced search results and news stories relating to Vice President Kamala Harris. Alphabet had claimed that this \"error\" was the \"result of its algorithm\" that is programmed to automatically generate news topics \"related to a Google Search inquiry,\" according to the letter.\n\n\"The company also noted that 'predictions may be unexpected or imperfect, and bugs will occur,'\" the report reads.\n\nSince news of the apparent discrepancy first broke, various Republican lawmakers, including Sen. Roger Marshall, criticized Google for its alleged \"censorship against conservative voices,\" calling for an investigation into the platform.\n\n\"Google's failure to provide suggestions related to the assassination attempt against President Trump on July 13, 2024 as part of its search function is yet another example of censorship against conservative voices and violates the intent of Section 230,\" Marshall said in the letter. \"Omitting suggestions to the most obvious and recent victim of an assassination attempt shows a willful discrimination against President Trump and users of your search engine.\"\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation.","Rumors have circulated that Joe Rogan is preparing to file a $30 million lawsuit against MSNBC.\n\nThe network allegedly deceptively edited Rogan's comments on a recent podcast episode with Michael Malice to make him appear supportive of Kamala Harris.\n\n\"She is a strong woman.

If not, what steps does the company take to audit how the algorithm is functioning?\"\n\nJordan said Google has an ongoing obligation to produce to Congress documents pursuant to a February 2023 subpoena, even if the documents were created after the subpoena was received.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee has investigated political bias among big tech companies and digital advertisers, saying that an advertising association known as the Global Alliance for Responsible Media might have violated anti-trust laws by discouraging companies from advertising with conservative media sources and purporting to speak with one voice on behalf of advertisers in order to leverage changes in tech platforms that helped Democrats.","A 66-year-old Virginia man is charged with threatening to burn Vice President Kamala Harris alive to see her suffer.\n\nA prosecutor for the Western District of Virginia said Frank Lucio Carillo was in court Monday for a preliminary hearing over death threats he made against the vice president, who's also the Democratic party's nominee for president in November.\n\nUsing the name \"joemadarats1\" on his GETTER social media account, Carillo mentioned Harris nearly 20 times, prosecutors said.

The storm made landfall on the gulf coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 65 mph. More than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia. At least four storm-related deaths have been reported.

Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change.

The S&P 500 sank 3.1% in late trading Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1,009 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.8%. That followed a 12.4% plunge for Japan's Nikkei 225, its worst day since 1987. Treasury yields pared their losses after a report showed U.S. services businesses are continuing to grow.

The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.\n\nKamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.\n\nSupreme Court shuts down Missouri's long shot push to lift Trump's gag order in hush-money case\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court has shut down a long-shot push from Missouri seeking to remove a gag order in former President Donald Trump's hush-money case and delay his sentencing in New York. The decision comes Monday after the Missouri attorney general had argued in the unusual request that the New York gag order wrongly limits what the GOP presidential nominee could say on the campaign trail and Trump's eventual sentence could affect his ability to travel. New York countered that the limited gag order does allow Trump to talk about the issues important to voters, and the sentence may not affect his movement at all.\n\nGoogle loses massive antitrust case over its search dominance\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. After reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\nHundreds in Israel mark the 5th birthday of a child held hostage in Gaza\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Hundreds of Israelis have sent orange balloons into the air to mark the fifth birthday of one of two children held captive by militants in the Gaza Strip. Ariel Bibas, who along with his 1-year-old brother Kfir, has become a symbol of the struggle to release the hostages. The orange balloons are meant to symbolize Ariel and Kfir's bright red hair. During its Oct. 7 attack, Hamas killed 1,200 people and took some 250 people hostage, according to Israeli authorities. Among the 110 still held hostage, the Bibas boys are said to be the only children.\n\nThis preschool in Alaska changed lives for parents and kids alike. Why did it have to close?\n\nWASILLA, Alaska (AP) -- In rural Alaska, the federally funded Head Start preschool program has helped parents earn college degrees. It has put parents with drug addictions on paths toward recovery and educated children who have ended up in foster care. And, of course, it has readied youngsters for kindergarten. So it was crushing when one of Alaska's Head Start providers closed two of its preschools. The program suffers nationally from a teacher shortage -- its teachers must have college degrees, and they can often earn more working in retail or at local school districts. The preschool closures in Alaska preview what other regions across the country could soon face.\n\nAt the Paris Olympics, it will no longer be personal for Ukraine's athletes. This time, it's war\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- For Ukrainian athletes, the Paris Olympics are more than just sports. They're a way to draw attention to their country's fight for survival against Russia -- a sort of war on another battlefield. But an Associated Press analysis found Russia's war is making it increasingly difficult for Ukraine, once a post-Soviet sports power, to get those headline-capturing medals. Ukrainian performances began dipping after 2014, the year of Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea. Ukraine's haul of 11 medals at the 2016 Rio Games was its smallest as an independent nation and it tumbled to a low of 22nd in the country rankings. Ukraine recovered to 16th at the pandemic-delayed Olympics in Tokyo in 2021 but just one of its 19 medals was gold -- another new low.","A University of Massachusetts Amherst poll, conducted between July 29 and August 1, showed a 7-point swing in the presidential race since the last time the poll was conducted in January.\n\nThe poll went from a 4-point lead for former President Donald Trump over President Joe Biden to a 3-point lead for Vice President Kamala Harris over Trump.\n\nThe poll found that 43% of respondents planned to vote or were inclined to vote for Trump, the same percentage who answered the question that way in January.\n\nHowever, while 39% of respondents said in January that they planned to vote for Biden, or were inclined to vote for him, the recent poll showed that 46% planned or were inclined to vote for Harris.\n\nCandidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. received 6 percent of the vote in the latest poll, down from 9 percent in January.\n\nThe poll, conducted in partnership with WCVB-TV, involved interviews with a sample of 1,000 people nationwide and has a margin of error of 3.8 percent.\n\nThe presidential race was disrupted last month by two major events: an assassination attempt on Trump and Biden's withdrawal from the race after extreme pressure from his party.\n\nHarris was able to quickly win support from party leaders, members of Congress and delegates to the Democratic National Convention, who will vote this month to confirm the nomination.\n\nThe UMass poll is the latest sign that Harris has shifted the race in Democrats' favor since becoming the likely nominee.\n\nHarris' arrival has really shaken up the presidential race, Jesse Rhodes, a UMass Amherst political science professor and co-director of the poll, said in a press release. Whereas Donald Trump was once a clear favorite over Joe Biden, we now see Harris with a slight lead. This appears to be due to big shifts among young voters, African Americans and Latinos in favor of Harris. Moderates also appear to have shifted dramatically in favor of Harris. The 2024 presidential election is still extremely close, but it's an entirely different race than it was a month ago.\n\nOf those who said they would vote for Harris, 66% cited as their main reason that she represents a new generation. The next most common response, at 37%, was that she would strengthen America's global standing.\n\nAmong those who chose Trump, 75% cited his accomplishments in his first term as the main reason they would vote for him, followed by \"He will save America\" at 48%.\n\nThe poll also looked at voter enthusiasm since Harris joined the race. Among Democratic respondents, 66% said they were much more enthusiastic or somewhat more enthusiastic since Harris replaced Biden at the top of the ticket.\n\nAmong Republicans, 37% said they were either much more enthusiastic or somewhat more enthusiastic.\n\nKamala Harris improved her standing in Biden's primary race across virtually every demographic subset, including a 17% gain among independents and a notable 14 percentage point increase among young voters, Alexander Theodoridis, co-director of the poll and an associate professor of political science at UMass, said in a statement. The three months until Election Day may feel like an eternity in political time, and the final weeks should remind us how quickly fortunes can turn, but Harris and the Democrats are at a major turning point.\n\nRespondents largely agree on one point regarding the importance of the election. Of all respondents, 89% rated the results of the 2024 election as very important or extremely important.\n\nView the full survey results here.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 24, 2020, / Compare-autoinsurance.Org has launched a new blog post that presents the main benefits of comparing multiple car insurance quotes.

It was inspiring. It was galvanizing,\" said TaRessa Stovall, a Mount Laurel writer and one of the 44,000 people on the historic Win With Black Women call, kicking off the virtual fundraising trend Harris' possible ascension to the presidency ignited. \"It was like church, a full tent revival, and pep rally all at once. There was an immediate sense of community.\"\n\nJust when we thought we were over Zoom, the meeting app has come into its own as an indispensable political tool. Fascinating, yes. But not far-fetched, as social media and easy-to-use apps continue to shape how we protest, politic, and advocate.\n\nGalvanizing support for candidates is as old as politics itself, said Sergei Kostiaev, assistant professor of political science at Drexel University. Politicians are and always will be searching for effective ways to talk about themselves, the issues, and prove their opponents wrong, he said. \"The nature of politics doesn't change, it's how we mobilize and communicate that changes, Kostiaev added. \"Zoom is the latest tool.\"\n\nThanks to the pandemic, most of us are well-versed with Zoom. We know how to have side convos in the chat and how to turn off the camera for bathroom breaks. Organizing Zooms can take less than a minute and hopping on one, seconds. We have Zoom in the background while washing dishes and tucking in the kids. And it's a lot easier to show up to a virtual event and make a donation than find a babysitter, get gussied up in sparkles and heels, and make said donation. \"People don't have to leave their house and they still feel like they were in the political trenches,\" Kostiaev said. \"It provides access, satisfaction, and convenience.\"\n\nZoom's impact on Harris' race has been astounding. Win With Black Women raised $1.5 million on its first VP Harris for President call. Fifty-three thousand Black men raised $1.3 million on Zoom the following evening. That same week, 160,000 white women met on Zoom and raised $8.5 million and to Fox Network's chagrin, 180,000 White Dudes for Harris, raised $4 million. Cat Ladies for Kamala hosted a Zoom Call To Action Sunday evening, and according to Instagram, raised $320,000 by the end of the call.\n\nHarris secured enough votes Friday from Democratic delegates to officially be named the party's nominee for president and her campaign raised $310 million in July, more than double what the Trump campaign raised. In less than two weeks, political pundits say, Harris has reset the race, up by 1 point in the polls.\n\nNow, we need this Zoom momentum to translate into votes.\n\n\" READ MORE: I'm not interested in your Kamala Harris memes. I just want you to vote.\n\nThose of us tired of Trump and vice-presidential nominee, JD Vance, talking to Black people, Latinos, Asians, Jewish folks -- heck, women who don't have children -- as if we are not American, nor do we deserve to be, are turning to Zoom not just to raise money, but to vent. We are finding two truths: we are not alone and there is strength in numbers.\n\nJotaka Eaddy, founded Win With Black Women during the 2020 presidential election to support then vice presidential candidate, Harris. Her goal: to ensure when Trump attacked -- and he did -- that Harris had a force field of millions of Black women supporting her. Rep. Joyce Beatty, scheduled to appear on the July 21 evening's night Zoom, mentioned the Zoom on MSNBC and by the end of the night Black women were getting text alerts to come to the meeting -- I got at least five, and was one of the many women who tried but couldn't access the call.\n\nIf we wanted to save democracy, we had to get busy.\n\n\"The Right has worked really hard to redefine this concept of identity politics as something bad,\" said Sarah J. Jackson, an associate professor in the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication and expert on Black and feminist media and activism. \"The truth is affinity groups are all invested in the same project of saving democracy this election. This is something that's kind of beautiful, something that a functional multiracial democracy should look like.\"\n\nTrump will continue to run his ugly divide and conquer plays. He will continue to say untrue things about people of color -- like suggesting there is such a thing as Black jobs -- to unite his racist followers. Last week Trump stooped to a new low, questioning Harris' Blackness at the National Association of Black Journalists Convention in Chicago, never mind Harris attended Howard University, an HBCU, and pledged Alpha Kappa Alpha, the country's oldest Black sorority. Never mind Harris, whose mother is Indian and father is Jamaican, has always identified as a proud, Black woman -- her late 1980s Salt-N-Pepa asymmetrical cut speaks Gen X Black woman volumes.\n\nIn addition to creating safe spaces for affinity groups, Zoom is creating a platform for our allies and accomplices to speak, raise money, and speak out in large numbers. During the \"White Woman: Answer the Call! Show up for Kamala Harris\" call, white women admitted to failing when they did not vote for Hillary Clinton, pledging to elect -- and make other White women elect -- the first woman of color as president. Now they know their reproductive rights and those of their children depend on it. White Dudes for Harris double down on the idea that Trump doesn't speak for all white men, proving the must vulnerable of us have more allies than we realized.\n\nThat warms my heart more than the millions of dollars raised for Harris' campaign.\n\nHarris sloughed Trump's comments as his same old show of \"divisiveness and disrespect\" in her response to Trump's NABJ tirade.\" We deserve a leader who understands that our differences to not divide us -- they are an essential source of our strength,\" Harris said.\n\nMAGA Republicans are counting on a divided America will distract us so much Trump can easily slide into a second presidency. Harris' candidacy is giving us a shot at saving our democracy, one Zoom call at a time.","A 66-year-old Virginia man is charged with threatening to burn Vice President Kamala Harris alive to see her suffer.\n\nA prosecutor for the Western District of Virginia said Frank Lucio Carillo was in court Monday for a preliminary hearing over death threats he made against the vice president, who's also the Democratic party's nominee for president in November.\n\nUsing the name \"joemadarats1\" on his GETTER social media account, Carillo mentioned Harris nearly 20 times, prosecutors said.

During an early August appearance on ITK, Charlamagne predicted that if Democratic nominee Kamala Harris defeats Trump in November, the U.S. Supreme Court will overturn the election results.\n\n\"Right now, everybody should be focusing on the Supreme Court,\" Charlamagne argued. \"The Supreme Court is no longer a legitimate institution -- the same Supreme Court that Donald Trump put three judges on.

In light of all of those recent rulings, what makes us think the Supreme Court wouldn't overturn the results of an election?\"\n\nMany Trump critics, including \"Real Time\" host Bill Maher, have predicted that Trump will not accept the election results if he loses -- a prediction Maher also made in 2020.\n\nCharlamagne, however, is going a step further in predicting that the U.S. Supreme Court will help Trump steal the election if he loses.\n\n\"That's honestly what I see coming,\" the radio host warned. \"I see that happening right now.

Why did it have to close?\n\nWASILLA, Alaska (AP) -- In rural Alaska, the federally funded Head Start preschool program has helped parents earn college degrees. It has put parents with drug addictions on paths toward recovery and educated children who have ended up in foster care. And, of course, it has readied youngsters for kindergarten. So it was crushing when one of Alaska's Head Start providers closed two of its preschools. The program suffers nationally from a teacher shortage -- its teachers must have college degrees, and they can often earn more working in retail or at local school districts. The preschool closures in Alaska preview what other regions across the country could soon face.\n\nAt the Paris Olympics, it will no longer be personal for Ukraine's athletes. This time, it's war\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- For Ukrainian athletes, the Paris Olympics are more than just sports. They're a way to draw attention to their country's fight for survival against Russia -- a sort of war on another battlefield. But an Associated Press analysis found Russia's war is making it increasingly difficult for Ukraine, once a post-Soviet sports power, to get those headline-capturing medals. Ukrainian performances began dipping after 2014, the year of Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea. Ukraine's haul of 11 medals at the 2016 Rio Games was its smallest as an independent nation and it tumbled to a low of 22nd in the country rankings. Ukraine recovered to 16th at the pandemic-delayed Olympics in Tokyo in 2021 but just one of its 19 medals was gold -- another new low.\n\nFor female athletes of color, scrutiny around gender rules and identity is part of a long trend\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Female athletes of color have historically faced disproportionate scrutiny and discrimination when it comes to sex testing and false accusations that they are male or transgender. Algerian boxer Imane Khelif and Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-Ting are the latest examples of women of color who have found themselves caught in a contentious debate around gender regulations and perceptions in sports. Historians and anthropologists say international sporting federations don't tend to promote an understanding of diversity in sex and gender identity. They note that gender tests have often targeted female athletes of color who don't conform to typically Western, white ideals of femininity.","A 66-year-old Virginia man is charged with threatening to burn Vice President Kamala Harris alive to see her suffer.\n\nA prosecutor for the Western District of Virginia said Frank Lucio Carillo was in court Monday for a preliminary hearing over death threats he made against the vice president, who's also the Democratic party's nominee for president in November.\n\nUsing the name \"joemadarats1\" on his GETTER social media account, Carillo mentioned Harris nearly 20 times, prosecutors said. Some of those postings were menacing in nature including one claiming the 59-year-old politician would regret running for the presidency after he plucked \"out her eyes with a pair of pliers.\"\n\nCarillo is also accused of threatening to shoot anyone who tried to protect Harris in that July 27 post.\n\nAnother comment on the suspect's GETTER account calls for someone to incinerate the Democratic candidate.\n\n\"Kamala Harris needs to be put on fire alive,\" he wrote the same day, according to a Friday court filing. \"I will do it personally if no one else does it. I want her to suffer a slow agonizing death.\"\n\nAlso last week, Carillo allegedly wrote to Harris \"Just for being a Democrat you're going to die.\"\n\nLaw enforcement officers said in an affidavit they found a rifle and a handgun in the suspect's home Winchester, VA., home during a search last week. When police came to Carillo's door, he reportedly asked if their visit was \"about the online stuff\" and didn't deny posting the messages.\n\nThe 2024 presidential election is shaping up to be highly contentious. Republican candidate Donald Trump has recently escalated his attempts to draw attention to Harris being a woman of color.\n\nHe's also planted the seed that, if he loses in November, it will be because the election was somehow rigged. He made that same false assertion after being defeated handily by President Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nDays before the Republican National Committee made Trump its presidential candidate for third straight time last month, a Pennsylvania gunman fired several shots at the 78-year-old Queens native at a rally, wounding the nominee's ear.\n\nIt remains unclear why the shooter, a 20-year-old registered Republican, attempted to assassinate the party's representative to lead the country.","Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appeared in a New York court on Monday to fight a residency challenge as he seeks to get on the state's ballot as an independent candidate for the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe Associated Press (AP) reported that Kennedy appeared in a civil court in Albany, New York, to fight against a lawsuit that alleges he falsely claimed New York as his residence. According to state election law, the presiding judge will decide the case without a jury.\n\nThe lawsuit contends that Kennedy's nominating petition falsely claimed his residence was in New York City's northern suburbs while he has actually been living in Los Angeles since his 2014 marriage to Curb Your Enthusiasm star Cheryl Hines.\n\nThe AP reported that the case against Kennedy was brought by Clear Choice PAC, a group formed earlier this year by allies of President Joe Biden.\n\nDuring the trial on Monday, a Kennedy friend named David Michaelis took the stand and testified Kennedy was a frequent guest at his home in Westchester County from 2014 to 2017. According to the AP, Michaelis received a document while testifying which showed Kennedy said that Michaelis had asked him to move out of his house in March 2023 over his support for Biden.\n\nHowever, Michaelis called the statement \"fiction\" and said Kennedy never lived in his home.\n\nIn his New York ballot petition, Kennedy lists his residence in the state as a home belonging to a different friend in Katonah, a wealthy suburb in Westchester County. Kennedy claims he moved there after being asked to vacate Michaelis' residence.\n\nHowever, the lawsuit argues that Kennedy \"has no meaningful or continuous connections to the property\" in Katonah and has spent \"vanishingly little time, if any,\" at the location.\n\n\"Moreover, the evidence will show that Kennedy's wife and children live in California, along with his three dogs, two ravens, an emu and his personal belongings,\" the lawsuit says, according to the AP.\n\nIn a Monday statement, Kennedy's attorney, William F. Savino of Woods Oviatt Gilman, said: \"The home at 84 Croton Lake Road in Katonah, New York, is Mr. Kennedy's official address.\"\n\n\"He receives mail there. His driver's license and automobile are registered there. His voting registration, and fishing, and falconry licenses are from New York. His law office is in New York. He pays taxes to New York State,\" Savino said in the statement. \"New York has been his residence continuously since 1964, and Mr. Kennedy has deep ties to it. He even keeps his beloved falcons in New York State. He has never claimed any other state as a residency. He intends to move back to New York as soon as his wife retires from acting.\"\n\nEarlier on Monday, Kennedy made headlines after sharing a video on X (formerly Twitter) in which he said that he was behind the dumping of a dead bear cub in New York's Central Park.\n\nThe story originally made headlines in 2014 when a woman found the dead cub while walking her dog. On Sunday, Kennedy shed new light on the case, admitting it was he who left the cub there. He gave an account of the events in a video posted to X, ahead of an upcoming article in The New Yorker that he said was going to break the story.\n\nNewsweek was directed to the statement from Savino after reaching out to Kennedy's campaign via email for comment.","A women's group is calling on Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democrat nominee in the 2024 presidential election, not to pick Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as her running mate due to concerns about how he handled sexual assault claims that emerged in his office.\n\nHarris is expected to reveal her vice presidential pick no later than Tuesday. Shapiro is widely seen as one of the frontrunners to secure a place on the Democrats' presidential ticket.\n\nThe National Women's Defense League, which describes itself as \"a nonpartisan organization dedicated to preventing sexual harassment and protecting survivors,\" released a statement on Facebook last week expressing concern about the possibility that Harris might pick Shapiro.\n\n\"The American people deserve to know that if called to a higher office, Governor Josh Shapiro will do more to ensure the safety and dignity of employees, volunteers and constituents in his office,\" the NWDL stated. \"As the Harris campaign and the Democratic Party consider their options for vice presidential candidates, we urge them to consider the handling of past complaints of sexual harassment inside the Pennsylvania governor's office.\"\n\nThe NWDL specifically brought up \"sexual harassment happening in [Shapiro's] own office by Cabinet Secretary Mike Vereb,\" asserting that the office \"should have done a better job preventing\" it from happening in the first place.\n\nExamples of actions it wished Shapiro's office would have taken include \"protecting the survivor who bravely came forward, ensuring that any other potential survivors felt safe in speaking up, and ensuring that the harasser didn't have the opportunity to do further harm after the complaint.\"\n\n\"Our research indicates that there is rarely only one survivor in cases like this one,\" the group added. \"When it comes to sexual harassment, silence is not golden -- it's a red flag. Often, it indicates that others may not feel safe or supported in coming forward with their truth. NWDL acknowledges potential silent survivors and we stand with those who choose not to share their experiences publicly.\"\n\nAccording to the group, \"[s]exual harassment is especially rampant in our government and political workspaces, and we need leaders who will buck the pernicious status quo.\"\n\n\"We deserve leaders who will not brush sexual harassment under the rug, but will put accountability above politics. We need leaders who prioritize effective policies, protocols and culture that prevents sexual harassment and protects survivors,\" they added.\n\nThe subject of the sexual harassment complaint, Mike Vereb, served as secretary of legislative affairs from the start of the Shapiro administration in early 2023 until late September of that year.\n\nA statement from the governor's office from last September announced that Vereb was resigning and praised the Republican former state representative for \"six years securing funding for law enforcement and enhancing school safety in the Office of Attorney General and the critical first year of our Administration getting a historic, bipartisan budget across the finish line.\"\n\nShapiro's Chief of Staff Dana Fritz described Vereb as \"a key member of our team,\" adding that they \"wish Mike all the best and we're grateful for his service.\" The statement did not mention any sexual harassment allegations against Vereb.\n\nA report from Spotlight PA details how an unnamed former staffer filed a complaint in May 2023 alleging that Vereb had made inappropriate, lewd and sexually suggestive comments to her and that the state retaliated against her when she raised questions about his image. Subsequent reporting reveals that the governor's office released a settlement of $295,000 with the survivor that also requires staff to undergo sexual harassment training.\n\nThe governor's office has a policy in place requiring that the Equal Opportunity Officer of a particular agency where alleged acts of sexual harassment may have occurred to conduct an investigation after receiving a complaint that includes interviews with the complainant, alleged offender and any witnesses. Implemented in 2012, the policy predates Shapiro's tenure as governor.\n\nShapiro is seen as an attractive contender for the vice presidential nomination because he is governor of a critical swing state that has 19 electoral votes. The RealClearPolitics average of polls taken of Pennsylvania voters shows Harris trailing former President Donald Trump, her Republican opponent, by 1.8 percentage points.\n\nHowever, criticism of Shapiro extends beyond concerns about his office's handling of the sexual assault claim. Michael Moore, a progressive filmmaker and activist, has warned that Harris' selection of Shapiro, an observant Jew and a strong supporter of Israel, could cost her support in the swing state of Michigan. In a Substack post published last week, Moore complained that \"Shapiro said it's 'antisemitic' for anyone to join the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel.\"\n\nMoore identified Shapiro's position on Israel as well as his comments about college students protesting as behaviors that will \"diminish the Arab American vote for Harris and depress a large swath of the youth vote throughout the country,\" noting that \"Michigan has one of the largest Arab American populations in the nation.\"\n\nMichigan has 15 electoral college votes and the RealClearPolitics average of polls taken there shows Harris leading Trump by 2 percentage points.","Adin Ross is not a name one might expect to come up in a conversation about the 2024 presidential election. Ross, 23, is a Twitch streamer who first became famous for playing NBA 2K online with LeBron James's son before he was banned from the platform after a repeated use of slurs. As he has grown into his fame, the Gen-Z streamer has grown more conservative, hanging out with Andrew Tate and hosting white supremacist Nick Fuentes on his stream.\n\nThis is the platform that Donald Trump chose for his first media hit of the week. On the livestreaming service Kick, where Ross has hosted his stream since being removed from Twitch, Trump walked out to 50 Cent's \"Many Men\" as a small audience applauded in a room in Mar-a-Lago where the cameras were set up. \"Do you know what livestreaming is?\" Ross asked Trump.\n\n\"More or less,\" Trump answered. \"It's the new wave.\" In the hour-plus interview, Trump went through his usual stream-of-consciousness stump speech. Ross, a little over his head, was unable to contribute to the conversation beyond lines like, \"That's really sad to think about\" or \"Damn, that's crazy to think about.\" Trump did manage to direct a few lines to the young audience tuning in. \"Youth tends to be Democrat,\" he said, but unlike past elections, the country \"can't wait 50 years\" for this demographic shift. \"Make the move now, all of you young people,\" he said to the 450,000 people tuned in. Ross, feeling generous, gave Trump a Rolex and a Tesla Cybertruck with a full MAGA vinyl wrap. He forced Trump, in his own home, to meet other guys whose job is video games. In the parking lot next to Trump's new ride, they did Trump's weird little hand dance.\n\nIt was an interesting choice for Trump to appear on an edgelord gamer's stream at a moment when his campaign desperately needs to shift the momentum in his favor. But Republicans have been dipping into the demo of conservative-leaning podcasts by and for Gen-Z guys for some time now. Last week, vice-presidential candidate J.D. Vance appeared on a podcast with the Nelk Boys, a group of Canadian influencers who rose to fame by doing Jackass-lite pranks and partying all the time; they have since become a must-stop visit for Republican politicians trying to get in front of fratty young voters. (In his hour with hosts Steiny and Kyle Forgeard, Vance talked about getting the call from Trump that he would be his next VP choice while his son wanted to talk to him about Pokémon. \"Shut the hell up for 30 seconds about Pikachu,\" Vance joked, unpleasantly, that he told his son. \"This is the most important phone call of my life. Please, just let me take this phone call.\") Trump himself appeared on the Nelk Boys' podcast back in 2022 in an episode that YouTube removed because Trump went on a rant about false election-fraud claims, which is a violation of the company's policy.\n\nTrump has yet to reprise his Nelk Boys appearance, but it looks like more is on the way from the Canadian group whose videos include \"We Corrupted an Amish Person!\" and \"Andrew Tate Stole Our Girl at the Club!\" Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Nelk Boys are involved in a $20 million PAC called Send the Vote. The group will target the \"growing movement of young people across this country rallying behind a pro-freedom, pro-America agenda,\" as its business partner told the Journal. Events include voter-registration drives at sports events and Ultimate Fighting Championship-adjacent parties in which attendees must prove they are registered to vote to get in. For what it's worth, UFC president Dana White appears to be the common thread between Trump and these young conservative men with talk shows. \"Shout-out to Dana,\" Ross said on Monday. \"There's nobody like him,\" Trump added.\n\nIt's too early to say if the plan will work to mobilize young male voters who may be moving toward the Republican Party. But at least Donald Trump appears to be having fun so far. This summer, he's gotten to golf on a stream with 30-year-old pro Bryson DeChambeau and talked about the world of combat sports with YouTuber and budding wrestling star Logan Paul. As many people have noted, his video with Paul was one of the only times we've seen Trump earnestly laugh in a long while."]}]}

Yet there it was, being used in a new context -- one that, while perhaps altered by the president's recent decision not to run for a second term, has been employed with remarkable frequency in the intervening months, especially recently, when it comes to this country's presidential future.\n\nAs the pundits weighed in on Joe Biden's abysmal performance at that June 27th debate with Donald Trump and cast doubt on his prospects for reelection, \"learned helplessness\" was used over and over again in the days leading up to his withdrawal from the presidential race in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris. Two days after the debate, for instance, The Economist, focusing on Biden's refusal to declare himself a non-candidate for the presidency, concluded that \"many [Democrats] have fallen into learned helplessness,\" as evidenced by the gap between their private doubts and their public assertions.\n\nWriting for the San Francisco-based progressive daily, 48hills, Bruce Mirkin chastised the Democrats for choosing hopelessness over hope. \"Instead of 'yes, we can,'\" he wrote, \"the instinctive response from a good portion of the folks who should be helping to defend democracy seems to be 'no, we can't.'\" He then labeled the party's inaction \"learned helplessness.\" Jordan Zakarin, writing for the Center for American Progress Action's Progress Report, extended that diagnosis from \"the worst debate performance in modern history\" to the larger moment in Washington. He pointed, for instance, to Attorney General Merrick Garland having \"slow-walked prosecuting Donald Trump.\" \"It is,\" he concluded, \"a learned helplessness,\" a \"preemptive surrender.\"\n\nThe question is: What should we make of the concept of \"learned helplessness\"? Where did it come from and what are the remedies writ large? In this distinctly disturbing moment in our history, is it possible that an all-American version of despair and hopelessness has changed in light of Joe Biden's backing out of the presidential race?\n\nThe Psychological Concept\n\nTo better understand the sudden shower of references to \"learned helplessness,\" a little history is in order. In the late 1960s, psychologist Martin Seligman coined the term while conducting experiments with dogs. He had accidentally stumbled on the fact that dogs that experienced electrical shocks without having any control over starting or stopping them were ultimately rendered strangely passive. They proved unwilling to move, even to escape further mistreatment.\n\nAfter more experiments demonstrated that being subjected to severe pain or stress did indeed induce a state of inaction in dogs, Seligman then turned to humans and discovered that individuals who had suffered an act or acts of trauma and abuse continued, well after the painful incident, to show signs of depression and anxiety that rendered them completely unable to act. They continued to exist, he discovered, in a state of profound resignation and inaction, long after the traumatic moment in which they found themselves powerless. Afterward, they were convinced that nothing was under their control, that any action they might take would be futile, and that failure was inevitable, should they even try to act. (Later studies suggested that some elderly individuals might also experience such a state of profound resignation and inaction in response to \"stressful life events,\" at times in association with dementia.)\n\nBut here's the truly strange thing: more than three decades later in the years after the 9/11 attacks, Seligman's concept of \"learned helplessness\" would be quite purposely baked into the interrogation and torture program created and implemented for war on terror detainees by American officials during the administration of President George W. Bush. As the executive summary of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's torture report explained, one of the two psychologists contracted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for the purpose of devising its interrogation program \"had reviewed research on 'learned helplessness,' in which individuals might become passive and depressed in response to adverse or uncontrollable events. He theorized,\" the report added, \"that inducing such a state could encourage a detainee to cooperate and provide information.\"\n\nThat psychologist, Bruce Mitchell, even met with Seligman while designing techniques to use on war-on-terror detainees suspected of ties to the 9/11 terror group al-Qaeda and its leadership at the secret \"black sites\" the CIA set up globally. (Seligman, it seems, had no idea of the horrors Mitchell and his associates were planning.) Ironically enough, Seligman's findings and his concept of \"learned helplessness\" would indeed become a basic part of the development of the CIA's torture program. (Seligman would come to condemn the use of the concept for interrogations at those black sites. As The Washington Post reported, \"When [Seligman] later learned through media accounts how it was employed -- for enhanced interrogation -- he issued a statement: 'I am grieved and horrified that good science, which has helped so many people overcome depression, may have been used for such bad purposes.'\")\n\nTo induce a profound state of helplessness, those post-9/11 captives were sent to the CIA's black sites where they were subjected to \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" designed to elicit information from them. Their torture included beatings, being smashed into walls, being hung by their limbs in excruciatingly painful positions, forced nudity, sodomy, and repeated sleep deprivation, among other things. The CIA also used waterboarding (subjecting detainees to the feeling of drowning), placed them in coffin-like boxes, and threatened to use a gun or a power drill on those who refused to give answers sought by their interrogators. Just last month, in a pre-trial hearing at the forever prison the Bush administration set up offshore -- and away from the federal court system -- at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, in 2002, such techniques were once again described in detail, this time by John Bruce Jessen, the psychologist who, along with Mitchell, designed the nightmarish interrogation program. In addition to his testimony, he also demonstrated the technique of \"walling,\" which involved slamming a detainee's head against a wall.\n\nThe goal was simple: to reduce that prisoner to a profound state of complete paralysis and disempowerment in which, having no hope of relief or escape, he would do whatever his captors wanted. Detainees would see that there was no way out but to answer their captors' questions, which, it turned out, often led them, in desperation and a state of learned helplessness, to confess to things they hadn't done, to confess to whatever their captors wanted to hear.\n\nHaving studied and written about the nightmare of those prisoners and Guantánamo for so many years now, it's been supremely jarring to see the term \"learned helplessness\" re-emerge in connection to the current unnerving state of American politics and the 2024 presidential election. Yet, in many ways, it seems a strangely appropriate lens through which to view the world of Donald Trump and the rest of us. It was true, as many commented, that a sense of learned helplessness indisputably crept into the mindset of so many of us in this country -- at least prior to Joe Biden's decision not to pursue a second term as president.\n\nThe American people have indeed suffered multiple stressful, even traumatic experiences in recent years. The shock of a government that didn't protect them on September 11, 2001; the devastating experience of a president who refused to protect them from Covid, as bodies piled up on the streets of this country; the winnowing away of rights and liberties once protected by the Constitution and the Supreme Court -- from the overturning of Roe v. Wade to a rash of recent decisions, including one that gave a president essential immunity in relation to more or less anything he did, no matter how devastating; the inability of the courts to proceed in their prosecutions of Donald Trump; the nearly paralyzed state of a riven Congress amid an economic reality that has led so many younger Americans to be unable to purchase their own homes or send their children to college -- all have collectively cowed the population. Even before both the Supreme Court's presidential immunity decision and the dismal debate performance of Biden, a sense of learned helplessness seemed well in place, and understandably so.\n\nThe Republican Party has also succumbed to a state of learned helplessness. One after another, former opponents of Trump and the MAGA ideology he stands for have succumbed to his agenda and given up on pursuing their own independent goals. Republican vice-presidential nominee J.D. Vance is certainly a case in point. Having formerly called out Trump for his lack of morality, his xenophobia, and his racism, as well as for being a \"total fraud\" and \"America's Hitler,\" he is now on board with the ideas he once said he deplored, including, for example, an untethered anti-immigration stance that calls for massive deportations of illegal immigrants. Similarly, Trump's Republican election opponent Nikki Haley has given up her \"legacy of blunt assessments and brutal takedowns\" of the former president, as The Nation's John Nichols has aptly described her opposition to Trump, whom she once described as \"a dangerous stooge of Russian president Vladimir Putin.\"\n\nThe question is: What, if anything, does the research tell us about curing such a state?\n\nIs There, in Fact, a Cure?\n\nPsychologists do point to remedies for such a profound state of hopelessness. They suggest several healing paths forward, including therapy to examine the causes of one's despair and to discover constructive paths beyond it; exercise to stimulate the body and the mind; and a commitment to \"learned optimism,\" a pattern of reaction geared to expecting the best rather than the worst out of any situation. As Psychology Today points out, \"Seligman later developed the concept of learned optimism. By explaining events to ourselves in a constructive manner and developing a positive internal dialogue, people can break free from their cycle of helplessness.\" Small wins and an energized commitment to positivity are basic tenets of finding a way to \"learned optimism.\"\n\nIf a turn towards optimism offers a way out of the helplessness of our times, perhaps we are seeing the beginning of just such an event. Recently, Slate's Dahlia Lithwick, again invoking the term \"learned helplessness,\" suggested that reports of the plans of the Biden administration to back Supreme Court reform were a sign of the kind of future \"systemwide cognitive reboot for American voters that seems almost inconceivable in the generalized torpor and despair of July 2024.\" The headline of her article read, appropriately enough, \"Are We Finally Letting Go of Our Learned-Helplessness Syndrome Around the Supreme Court?\"\n\nSo, too, the outpouring of energy and excitement following Biden's decision to bow out of the presidential race and the enthusiasm for newer, younger Democratic Party leadership -- and for Vice President Kamala Harris, in particular -- already seems eons removed from the head-shaking resignation of Democratic voters confronting a \"choice\" between an aging Joe Biden and You Know Who on election day. In fact, in many ways, that new turn of affairs could be just what the doctor ordered, though, of course, a possible November election victory for Donald Trump could still put the phrase \"learned helplessness\" in a grimly new light.\n\nFor Democrats, the idea that there could be a brighter future, one in which a sense of control replaced one of powerlessness -- an election in which their presidential candidate has a viable chance of winning -- has taken hold. In place of anxiety and depression, there is optimism, or at least a \"cautious hope.\" Declaring her \"immense pride and limitless optimism for our country's future,\" Nancy Pelosi echoed the importance of this newfound optimism when endorsing Kamala Harris as the party's candidate for 2024. As Tim Alberta summed it up in The Atlantic, \"As far back as springtime, the numbers told a straightforward story: Biden was not going to win. Democrats could only look on, powerless.\" However, now, he concludes, it is the Republicans who are feeling hope and control fade away: \"Sunday brought an unfamiliar feeling of powerlessness. For the first time in a long time, Trump does not control the narrative of 2024.\"\n\nWhether or not such optimism gains momentum in the potentially tumultuous days ahead remains to be seen, as does whether the Republicans can find a way out of their own potential sense of learned helplessness in the face of a changing scenario. Whatever happens, given what I know about the past use of that phrase and the nightmare of the war on terror's use of torture, my own hope is that, with election 2024, the very concept of learned helplessness and the realities it represents, whether it applies to torture at the hands of the U.S. government or suffering at the hands of Trumpian politics, can finally be politically laid to rest.\n\nCall it learned optimism, if you wish, but fingers crossed.\n\nThis piece first appeared on TomDispatch.\n\nFrom https://www.counterpunch.org/2024/08/06/learned-helplessness-and-the-2024-election/","Imagine my surprise when, nearly eight months ago, commenting on the state of the country as it approached the 2024 presidential election, New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg noted that \"Biden has set himself the task of trying to jolt the country out of its learned helplessness in the face of Trump's exhausting provocations.\" Unbeknownst to most Americans, that term, \"learned helplessness,\" was profoundly and inextricably tied to this country's disastrous post-9/11 Global War on Terror and, in particular, its horrifying torture program. Yet there it was, being used in a new context -- one that, while perhaps altered by the president's recent decision not to run for a second term, has been employed with remarkable frequency in the intervening months, especially recently, when it comes to this country's presidential future.\n\nAs the pundits weighed in on Joe Biden's abysmal performance at that June 27th debate with Donald Trump and cast doubt on his prospects for reelection, \"learned helplessness\" was used over and over again in the days leading up to his withdrawal from the presidential race in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris. Two days after the debate, for instance, The Economist, focusing on Biden's refusal to declare himself a non-candidate for the presidency, concluded that \"many [Democrats] have fallen into learned helplessness,\" as evidenced by the gap between their private doubts and their public assertions.\n\nWriting for the San Francisco-based progressive daily, 48hills, Bruce Mirkin chastised the Democrats for choosing hopelessness over hope. \"Instead of 'yes, we can,'\" he wrote, \"the instinctive response from a good portion of the folks who should be helping to defend democracy seems to be 'no, we can't.'\" He then labeled the party's inaction \"learned helplessness.\" Jordan Zakarin, writing for the Center for American Progress Action's Progress Report, extended that diagnosis from \"the worst debate performance in modern history\" to the larger moment in Washington. He pointed, for instance, to Attorney General Merrick Garland having \"slow-walked prosecuting Donald Trump.\" \"It is,\" he concluded, \"a learned helplessness,\" a \"preemptive surrender.\"\n\nThe question is: What should we make of the concept of \"learned helplessness\"? Where did it come from and what are the remedies writ large? In this distinctly disturbing moment in our history, is it possible that an all-American version of despair and hopelessness has changed in light of Joe Biden's backing out of the presidential race?\n\nThe Psychological Concept\n\nTo better understand the sudden shower of references to \"learned helplessness,\" a little history is in order. In the late 1960s, psychologist Martin Seligman coined the term while conducting experiments with dogs. He had accidentally stumbled on the fact that dogs that experienced electrical shocks without having any control over starting or stopping them were ultimately rendered strangely passive. They proved unwilling to move, even to escape further mistreatment.\n\nAfter more experiments demonstrated that being subjected to severe pain or stress did indeed induce a state of inaction in dogs, Seligman then turned to humans and discovered that individuals who had suffered an act or acts of trauma and abuse continued, well after the painful incident, to show signs of depression and anxiety that rendered them completely unable to act. They continued to exist, he discovered, in a state of profound resignation and inaction, long after the traumatic moment in which they found themselves powerless. Afterward, they were convinced that nothing was under their control, that any action they might take would be futile, and that failure was inevitable, should they even try to act. (Later studies suggested that some elderly individuals might also experience such a state of profound resignation and inaction in response to \"stressful life events,\" at times in association with dementia.)\n\nBut here's the truly strange thing: more than three decades later in the years after the 9/11 attacks, Seligman's concept of \"learned helplessness\" would be quite purposely baked into the interrogation and torture program created and implemented for war on terror detainees by American officials during the administration of President George W.

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby has moved menacingly into some of America's most historic Southern cities in what is expected to be a prolonged event of torrential downpours and flooding after slamming into Florida with heavy rain and high winds. Record-setting rain from the storm that killed at least five people on Monday was causing flash flooding in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Savannah Mayor Van Johnson told residents Monday night to hunker down and expect a rough day on Tuesday. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida Monday as a Category 1 hurricane.\n\nIsrael-Hamas war latest: Palestinians killed in West Bank as world leaders try to avoid regional war\n\nFour Palestinians have been killed and seven wounded by Israeli fire during a military raid in the occupied West Bank. World leaders meanwhile are trying to stop tensions in the Middle East from boiling over into a regional war after the killings of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon and Hamas' top political leader in Iran. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah says it launched a drone attack early Monday on northern Israel that the Israeli military said wounded two Israeli troops. Leaders in Egypt and Turkey say they are exhausting all avenues possible to prevent the Israel-Hamas war from becoming a wider regional conflict. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his Cabinet over the weekend that Israel is already in a \"multi-front war\" with Iran and its proxies.\n\nProtesters who toppled Hasina want Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus to lead Bangladesh\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- A key organizer of Bangladesh's student protests says Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is their choice as head of an interim government a day after longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned. The country's figurehead president and the military chief said Monday that an interim government would be formed soon. Nahid Islam, the organizer, in a video post in social media said Tuesday the student protest leaders have already talked with Yunus, who consented to take over. Islam said the student protesters would announce more names for the government, and it would be a difficult challenge for the current leadership to ignore their choices.\n\nJapan's share benchmark soars nearly 11% a day after massive sell-offs that shook Wall Street\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index has soared more than 10% a day after it set markets tumbling in Europe and on Wall Street, while other world markets appeared to have settled after the rollercoaster ride that started the week. The Japanese index fell back after its biggest early advance, gaining 8.7% by midmorning on Tuesday. On Monday, nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as world markets quaked under fears the U.S. economy is slowing too much. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed the Nikkei's 12.4% plunge, its worst since 1987.\n\nVenezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo \"falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council\" and they openly incited \"police and military officials to disobey the laws.\"\n\nGoogle illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge has ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\nWitnesses will tell a federal safety board about the blowout on a Boeing 737 Max earlier this year\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board is about to hold a two-day hearing into the blowout of a panel from the side of a Boeing 737 Max airliner. The safety board's hearing starts Tuesday in Washington, D.C. It will hear from witnesses including its own investigators who have been looking into the Jan. 5 accident that occurred during an Alaska Airlines flight. The board is calling it a fact-finding hearing. The NTSB will not vote on a probable cause for the accident. That step probably won't happen for another year or longer after more investigation.\n\nHiroshima governor says nuclear disarmament must be tackled as a pressing issue, not an ideal\n\nTOKYO (AP) -- Hiroshima officials are urging world leaders to stop relying on nuclear weapons as deterrence and take immediate action toward abolishment -- not as an ideal, but to remove the risk of atomic war amid the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. They commented Tuesday as the city remembered its atomic bombing 79 years ago at the end of World War II. The memorial comes days after Japan and the U.S. reaffirmed Washington's commitment to \"extended deterrence,\" including atomic weapons, to protect its Asian ally. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has vowed to do his utmost to pursue \"realistic and practical measures\" to build global momentum for nuclear disarmament. Critics say it is a hollow promise.\n\nFrench Polynesian Kauli Vaast and Caroline Marks of U.S. win gold at Paris Olympics surfing\n\nTEAHUPO'O, Tahiti (AP) -- Kauli Vaast from French Polynesia and Caroline Marks from the United States won gold medals in surfing at the Paris Olympics in Tahiti on Monday. For the bronze medals, Gabriel Medina from Brazil and Johanne Defay from France won after beating Alonso Correa from Peru and Brisa Hennessy from Costa Rica, respectively. All new medalists are debuting for the Paris Olympics surfing competition after defending Olympic women's champion Carissa Moore of the United States was beaten in the quarterfinals. Six of the eight surfers in the semifinals represent different nations. The final day of the competition began Monday morning.","Not quite two years later, the threat of political violence would come for her husband at their home.\n\nThat was the chilling question the intruder posed to Paul Pelosi before bludgeoning the then-82-year-old over the head with a hammer in their San Francisco house. It echoed the menacing jeers of the rioters roaming the halls of the Capitol calling out \"Nancy, Nancy\" on Jan. 6.\n\nThe through line of escalating political rhetoric and violence in American public life serves as the opening and closing message of Pelosi's new book, \"The Art of Power, My Story as America's First Woman Speaker of the House.\"\n\nPelosi recounts her nearly four-decade legislative record in Congress but also allows a rare public glimpse into the private devastation around the assault on her husband. With it, she delivers a grave warning that the casual mockery and mimicry of political violence in America is chasing a generation from public service.\n\n\"The current climate of threats and attacks must stop,\" Pelosi writes.\n\n\"We cannot ask people to serve in public life if the cost is risking the safety of their families and those they love.\"\n\nPelosi's book pages through familiar terrain for those who have followed the 84-year-old's career, rising from \"housewife to House member to House speaker.\" The steely California Democrat, the speaker emerita, is no longer in leadership but running for reelection to the House this fall.\n\nShe twice won the speakers gavel, worked alongside seven presidents and, more recently, played a pivotal role in quietly convincing President Joe Biden to reassess his decision to remain in the 2024 presidential election rematch with Republican Donald Trump. Biden bowed out.\n\nBut it's the first and final chapters that bring a new element to the Pelosi era, detailing in personal and painstaking ways the toll that America's violent strain is taking on civic life and public service.\n\n\"I don't know that we will ever feel safe,\" she writes.\n\nWritten well before the July assassination attempt on Trump, Pelosi's assessment of the nation's dangerous discourse arrives after back-to-back congressional shootings of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise and earlier of Democratic former Rep. Gabby Giffords, and it serves as a walk-off warning in what could be among her final years in Congress.\n\nPelosi recounts her disbelief at being \"pulled off the Speaker's platform\" and out of the House chamber by security the afternoon of Jan. 6 as rioters sent by Trump stormed through the halls, some searching for her.\n\n\"I can handle it,\" she protested, telling U.S. Capitol Police she wanted to stay and finish the work as Congress was certifying the 2020 election.\n\n\"Their response was curt,\" she writes. \"'No, you can't.'\"\n\nAfter being whisked away to safety at Fort McNair, she writes about huddling with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the three of them desperately calling the Pentagon to send National Guard troops to restore order at the Capitol. She describes House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump loyalist, as almost entirely unseen.\n\nSo worried about the rioters' threats against Vice President Mike Pence in hiding at the Capitol, she called and told him, \"Don't let anybody know where you are.\"\n\n\"It still took three hours from the time I was dragged out of the House chamber for the Guard to arrive at the Capitol complex,\" she writes. \"It took about three and a half hours to clear the rioters from the building.\"\n\nLater, surveying the wreckage of broken glass and splintered wood, she was told of blood outside the Speaker's Lobby. In some places, including her office, the mob had \"literally defecated on the floors and rugs,\" she wrote. \"What was left behind was pure destruction.\"\n\nShe recalled being in war zones, and in Kyiv at the start of the Russian invasion thinking she may well die in Ukraine. \"I briefly thought the same on January 6,\" she wrote.\n\n\"When I became Speaker, I knew that I was making myself into a target,\" she writes. \"However, our accepting the risk is something that is fundamentally different for our families.\"\n\nNot quite two years later, she was awakened in the middle of the night by the \"Knock. Knock. Knock. Pound, Pound. Pound,\" of the Capitol Police security detail at her door in Washington.\n\nPelosi recounts the dizzying hours, frantic family phone calls and flight back to San Francisco, the hospital, the surgeries and the long recovery for her husband.

Yet there it was, being used in a new context -- one that, while perhaps altered by the president's recent decision not to run for a second term, has been employed with remarkable frequency in the intervening months, especially recently, when it comes to this country's presidential future.\n\nAs the pundits weighed in on Joe Biden's abysmal performance at that June 27th debate with Donald Trump and cast doubt on his prospects for reelection, \"learned helplessness\" was used over and over again in the days leading up to his withdrawal from the presidential race in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris. Two days after the debate, for instance, The Economist, focusing on Biden's refusal to declare himself a non-candidate for the presidency, concluded that \"many [Democrats] have fallen into learned helplessness,\" as evidenced by the gap between their private doubts and their public assertions.\n\nWriting for the San Francisco-based progressive daily, 48hills, Bruce Mirkin chastised the Democrats for choosing hopelessness over hope. \"Instead of 'yes, we can,'\" he wrote, \"the instinctive response from a good portion of the folks who should be helping to defend democracy seems to be 'no, we can't.'\" He then labeled the party's inaction \"learned helplessness.\" Jordan Zakarin, writing for the Center for American Progress Action's Progress Report, extended that diagnosis from \"the worst debate performance in modern history\" to the larger moment in Washington. He pointed, for instance, to Attorney General Merrick Garland having \"slow-walked prosecuting Donald Trump.\" \"It is,\" he concluded, \"a learned helplessness,\" a \"preemptive surrender.\"\n\nThe question is: What should we make of the concept of \"learned helplessness\"? Where did it come from and what are the remedies writ large? In this distinctly disturbing moment in our history, is it possible that an all-American version of despair and hopelessness has changed in light of Joe Biden's backing out of the presidential race?\n\nThe Psychological Concept\n\nTo better understand the sudden shower of references to \"learned helplessness,\" a little history is in order. In the late 1960s, psychologist Martin Seligman coined the term while conducting experiments with dogs. He had accidentally stumbled on the fact that dogs that experienced electrical shocks without having any control over starting or stopping them were ultimately rendered strangely passive. They proved unwilling to move, even to escape further mistreatment.\n\nAfter more experiments demonstrated that being subjected to severe pain or stress did indeed induce a state of inaction in dogs, Seligman then turned to humans and discovered that individuals who had suffered an act or acts of trauma and abuse continued, well after the painful incident, to show signs of depression and anxiety that rendered them completely unable to act. They continued to exist, he discovered, in a state of profound resignation and inaction, long after the traumatic moment in which they found themselves powerless. Afterward, they were convinced that nothing was under their control, that any action they might take would be futile, and that failure was inevitable, should they even try to act. (Later studies suggested that some elderly individuals might also experience such a state of profound resignation and inaction in response to \"stressful life events,\" at times in association with dementia.)\n\nBut here's the truly strange thing: more than three decades later in the years after the 9/11 attacks, Seligman's concept of \"learned helplessness\" would be quite purposely baked into the interrogation and torture program created and implemented for war on terror detainees by American officials during the administration of President George W. Bush. As the executive summary of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's torture report explained, one of the two psychologists contracted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for the purpose of devising its interrogation program \"had reviewed research on 'learned helplessness,' in which individuals might become passive and depressed in response to adverse or uncontrollable events. He theorized,\" the report added, \"that inducing such a state could encourage a detainee to cooperate and provide information.\"\n\nThat psychologist, Bruce Mitchell, even met with Seligman while designing techniques to use on war-on-terror detainees suspected of ties to the 9/11 terror group al-Qaeda and its leadership at the secret \"black sites\" the CIA set up globally. (Seligman, it seems, had no idea of the horrors Mitchell and his associates were planning.) Ironically enough, Seligman's findings and his concept of \"learned helplessness\" would indeed become a basic part of the development of the CIA's torture program. (Seligman would come to condemn the use of the concept for interrogations at those black sites. As The Washington Post reported, \"When [Seligman] later learned through media accounts how it was employed -- for enhanced interrogation -- he issued a statement: 'I am grieved and horrified that good science, which has helped so many people overcome depression, may have been used for such bad purposes.'\")\n\nTo induce a profound state of helplessness, those post-9/11 captives were sent to the CIA's black sites where they were subjected to \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" designed to elicit information from them. Their torture included beatings, being smashed into walls, being hung by their limbs in excruciatingly painful positions, forced nudity, sodomy, and repeated sleep deprivation, among other things. The CIA also used waterboarding (subjecting detainees to the feeling of drowning), placed them in coffin-like boxes, and threatened to use a gun or a power drill on those who refused to give answers sought by their interrogators. Just last month, in a pre-trial hearing at the forever prison the Bush administration set up offshore -- and away from the federal court system -- at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, in 2002, such techniques were once again described in detail, this time by John Bruce Jessen, the psychologist who, along with Mitchell, designed the nightmarish interrogation program. In addition to his testimony, he also demonstrated the technique of \"walling,\" which involved slamming a detainee's head against a wall.\n\nThe goal was simple: to reduce that prisoner to a profound state of complete paralysis and disempowerment in which, having no hope of relief or escape, he would do whatever his captors wanted. Detainees would see that there was no way out but to answer their captors' questions, which, it turned out, often led them, in desperation and a state of learned helplessness, to confess to things they hadn't done, to confess to whatever their captors wanted to hear.\n\nHaving studied and written about the nightmare of those prisoners and Guantánamo for so many years now, it's been supremely jarring to see the term \"learned helplessness\" re-emerge in connection to the current unnerving state of American politics and the 2024 presidential election. Yet, in many ways, it seems a strangely appropriate lens through which to view the world of Donald Trump and the rest of us. It was true, as many commented, that a sense of learned helplessness indisputably crept into the mindset of so many of us in this country -- at least prior to Joe Biden's decision not to pursue a second term as president.\n\nThe American people have indeed suffered multiple stressful, even traumatic experiences in recent years. The shock of a government that didn't protect them on September 11, 2001; the devastating experience of a president who refused to protect them from Covid, as bodies piled up on the streets of this country; the winnowing away of rights and liberties once protected by the Constitution and the Supreme Court -- from the overturning of Roe v. Wade to a rash of recent decisions, including one that gave a president essential immunity in relation to more or less anything he did, no matter how devastating; the inability of the courts to proceed in their prosecutions of Donald Trump; the nearly paralyzed state of a riven Congress amid an economic reality that has led so many younger Americans to be unable to purchase their own homes or send their children to college -- all have collectively cowed the population. Even before both the Supreme Court's presidential immunity decision and the dismal debate performance of Biden, a sense of learned helplessness seemed well in place, and understandably so.\n\nThe Republican Party has also succumbed to a state of learned helplessness. One after another, former opponents of Trump and the MAGA ideology he stands for have succumbed to his agenda and given up on pursuing their own independent goals. Republican vice-presidential nominee J.D. Vance is certainly a case in point. Having formerly called out Trump for his lack of morality, his xenophobia, and his racism, as well as for being a \"total fraud\" and \"America's Hitler,\" he is now on board with the ideas he once said he deplored, including, for example, an untethered anti-immigration stance that calls for massive deportations of illegal immigrants. Similarly, Trump's Republican election opponent Nikki Haley has given up her \"legacy of blunt assessments and brutal takedowns\" of the former president, as The Nation's John Nichols has aptly described her opposition to Trump, whom she once described as \"a dangerous stooge of Russian president Vladimir Putin.\"\n\nThe question is: What, if anything, does the research tell us about curing such a state?\n\nIs There, in Fact, a Cure?\n\nPsychologists do point to remedies for such a profound state of hopelessness. They suggest several healing paths forward, including therapy to examine the causes of one's despair and to discover constructive paths beyond it; exercise to stimulate the body and the mind; and a commitment to \"learned optimism,\" a pattern of reaction geared to expecting the best rather than the worst out of any situation. As Psychology Today points out, \"Seligman later developed the concept of learned optimism. By explaining events to ourselves in a constructive manner and developing a positive internal dialogue, people can break free from their cycle of helplessness.\" Small wins and an energized commitment to positivity are basic tenets of finding a way to \"learned optimism.\"\n\nIf a turn towards optimism offers a way out of the helplessness of our times, perhaps we are seeing the beginning of just such an event. Recently, Slate's Dahlia Lithwick, again invoking the term \"learned helplessness,\" suggested that reports of the plans of the Biden administration to back Supreme Court reform were a sign of the kind of future \"systemwide cognitive reboot for American voters that seems almost inconceivable in the generalized torpor and despair of July 2024.\" The headline of her article read, appropriately enough, \"Are We Finally Letting Go of Our Learned-Helplessness Syndrome Around the Supreme Court?\"\n\nSo, too, the outpouring of energy and excitement following Biden's decision to bow out of the presidential race and the enthusiasm for newer, younger Democratic Party leadership -- and for Vice President Kamala Harris, in particular -- already seems eons removed from the head-shaking resignation of Democratic voters confronting a \"choice\" between an aging Joe Biden and You Know Who on election day. In fact, in many ways, that new turn of affairs could be just what the doctor ordered, though, of course, a possible November election victory for Donald Trump could still put the phrase \"learned helplessness\" in a grimly new light.\n\nFor Democrats, the idea that there could be a brighter future, one in which a sense of control replaced one of powerlessness -- an election in which their presidential candidate has a viable chance of winning -- has taken hold. In place of anxiety and depression, there is optimism, or at least a \"cautious hope.\" Declaring her \"immense pride and limitless optimism for our country's future,\" Nancy Pelosi echoed the importance of this newfound optimism when endorsing Kamala Harris as the party's candidate for 2024. As Tim Alberta summed it up in The Atlantic, \"As far back as springtime, the numbers told a straightforward story: Biden was not going to win. Democrats could only look on, powerless.\" However, now, he concludes, it is the Republicans who are feeling hope and control fade away: \"Sunday brought an unfamiliar feeling of powerlessness. For the first time in a long time, Trump does not control the narrative of 2024.\"\n\nWhether or not such optimism gains momentum in the potentially tumultuous days ahead remains to be seen, as does whether the Republicans can find a way out of their own potential sense of learned helplessness in the face of a changing scenario. Whatever happens, given what I know about the past use of that phrase and the nightmare of the war on terror's use of torture, my own hope is that, with election 2024, the very concept of learned helplessness and the realities it represents, whether it applies to torture at the hands of the U.S. government or suffering at the hands of Trumpian politics, can finally be politically laid to rest.\n\nCall it learned optimism, if you wish, but fingers crossed.","Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is now official after the Democratic National Committee announced the formal results of the online voting by delegates on Monday night\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris, a daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history, formally secured the Democratic presidential nomination on Monday -- becoming the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket.\n\nMore than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed, Harris' coronation as her party's standard-bearer caps a tumultuous and frenetic period for Democrats prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous June debate performance that shattered his own supporters' confidence in his reelection prospects and spurred extraordinary intraparty warfare about whether he should stay in the race.","Kamala Harris is now Democratic presidential nominee, will face off against Donald Trump this fall\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is now official after the Democratic National Committee announced the formal results of the online voting by delegates on Monday night.

The Japanese index fell back after its biggest early advance, gaining 8.7% by midmorning on Tuesday. On Monday, nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as world markets quaked under fears the U.S. economy is slowing too much. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%.

They include Lebanon's Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels of Yemen, Shiite militias in Iraq and others. Those relationships are managed by Iran's powerful paramilitary organization, the Revolutionary Guard. Iran relies on those proxy forces as international sanctions on Tehran, including over its nuclear program, have kept it from receiving advanced weaponry. While developing its own missile program, Iran also relies on militias as an asymmetric threat to squeeze Israel and the United States.\n\nVenezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo \"falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council\" and they openly incited \"police and military officials to disobey the laws.\"\n\nGoogle illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge has ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\nWitnesses will tell a federal safety board about the blowout on a Boeing 737 Max earlier this year\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board is about to hold a two-day hearing into the blowout of a panel from the side of a Boeing 737 Max airliner.

They commented Tuesday as the city remembered its atomic bombing 79 years ago at the end of World War II. The memorial comes days after Japan and the U.S. reaffirmed Washington's commitment to \"extended deterrence,\" including atomic weapons, to protect its Asian ally. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has vowed to do his utmost to pursue \"realistic and practical measures\" to build global momentum for nuclear disarmament. Critics say it is a hollow promise.\n\nFrench Polynesian Kauli Vaast and Caroline Marks of U.S. win gold at Paris Olympics surfing\n\nTEAHUPO'O, Tahiti (AP) -- Kauli Vaast from French Polynesia and Caroline Marks from the United States won gold medals in surfing at the Paris Olympics in Tahiti on Monday.

Harris is a daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.","Imagine my surprise when, nearly eight months ago, commenting on the state of the country as it approached the 2024 presidential election, New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg noted that \"Biden has set himself the task of trying to jolt the country out of its learned helplessness in the face of Trump's exhausting provocations.\" Unbeknownst to most Americans, that term, \"learned helplessness,\" was profoundly and inextricably tied to this country's disastrous post-9/11 Global War on Terror and, in particular, its horrifying torture program. Yet there it was, being used in a new context -- one that, while perhaps altered by the president's recent decision not to run for a second term, has been employed with remarkable frequency in the intervening months, especially recently, when it comes to this country's presidential future.\n\nAs the pundits weighed in on Joe Biden's abysmal performance at that June 27th debate with Donald Trump and cast doubt on his prospects for reelection, \"learned helplessness\" was used over and over again in the days leading up to his withdrawal from the presidential race in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris. Two days after the debate, for instance, The Economist, focusing on Biden's refusal to declare himself a non-candidate for the presidency, concluded that \"many [Democrats] have fallen into learned helplessness,\" as evidenced by the gap between their private doubts and their public assertions.\n\nWriting for the San Francisco-based progressive daily, 48hills, Bruce Mirkin chastised the Democrats for choosing hopelessness over hope. \"Instead of 'yes, we can,'\" he wrote, \"the instinctive response from a good portion of the folks who should be helping to defend democracy seems to be 'no, we can't.'\" He then labeled the party's inaction \"learned helplessness.\" Jordan Zakarin, writing for the Center for American Progress Action's Progress Report, extended that diagnosis from \"the worst debate performance in modern history\" to the larger moment in Washington. He pointed, for instance, to Attorney General Merrick Garland having \"slow-walked prosecuting Donald Trump.\" \"It is,\" he concluded, \"a learned helplessness,\" a \"preemptive surrender.\"\n\nThe question is: What should we make of the concept of \"learned helplessness\"? Where did it come from and what are the remedies writ large? In this distinctly disturbing moment in our history, is it possible that an all-American version of despair and hopelessness has changed in light of Joe Biden's backing out of the presidential race?\n\nThe Psychological Concept\n\nTo better understand the sudden shower of references to \"learned helplessness,\" a little history is in order. In the late 1960s, psychologist Martin Seligman coined the term while conducting experiments with dogs. He had accidentally stumbled on the fact that dogs that experienced electrical shocks without having any control over starting or stopping them were ultimately rendered strangely passive. They proved unwilling to move, even to escape further mistreatment.\n\nAfter more experiments demonstrated that being subjected to severe pain or stress did indeed induce a state of inaction in dogs, Seligman then turned to humans and discovered that individuals who had suffered an act or acts of trauma and abuse continued, well after the painful incident, to show signs of depression and anxiety that rendered them completely unable to act. They continued to exist, he discovered, in a state of profound resignation and inaction, long after the traumatic moment in which they found themselves powerless. Afterward, they were convinced that nothing was under their control, that any action they might take would be futile, and that failure was inevitable, should they even try to act. (Later studies suggested that some elderly individuals might also experience such a state of profound resignation and inaction in response to \"stressful life events,\" at times in association with dementia.)\n\nBut here's the truly strange thing: more than three decades later in the years after the 9/11 attacks, Seligman's concept of \"learned helplessness\" would be quite purposely baked into the interrogation and torture program created and implemented for war on terror detainees by American officials during the administration of President George W. Bush. As the executive summary of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's torture report explained, one of the two psychologists contracted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for the purpose of devising its interrogation program \"had reviewed research on 'learned helplessness,' in which individuals might become passive and depressed in response to adverse or uncontrollable events. He theorized,\" the report added, \"that inducing such a state could encourage a detainee to cooperate and provide information.\"\n\nThat psychologist, Bruce Mitchell, even met with Seligman while designing techniques to use on war-on-terror detainees suspected of ties to the 9/11 terror group al-Qaeda and its leadership at the secret \"black sites\" the CIA set up globally. (Seligman, it seems, had no idea of the horrors Mitchell and his associates were planning.) Ironically enough, Seligman's findings and his concept of \"learned helplessness\" would indeed become a basic part of the development of the CIA's torture program. (Seligman would come to condemn the use of the concept for interrogations at those black sites. As The Washington Post reported, \"When [Seligman] later learned through media accounts how it was employed -- for enhanced interrogation -- he issued a statement: 'I am grieved and horrified that good science, which has helped so many people overcome depression, may have been used for such bad purposes.'\")\n\nTo induce a profound state of helplessness, those post-9/11 captives were sent to the CIA's black sites where they were subjected to \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" designed to elicit information from them. Their torture included beatings, being smashed into walls, being hung by their limbs in excruciatingly painful positions, forced nudity, sodomy, and repeated sleep deprivation, among other things. The CIA also used waterboarding (subjecting detainees to the feeling of drowning), placed them in coffin-like boxes, and threatened to use a gun or a power drill on those who refused to give answers sought by their interrogators. Just last month, in a pre-trial hearing at the forever prison the Bush administration set up offshore -- and away from the federal court system -- at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, in 2002, such techniques were once again described in detail, this time by John Bruce Jessen, the psychologist who, along with Mitchell, designed the nightmarish interrogation program. In addition to his testimony, he also demonstrated the technique of \"walling,\" which involved slamming a detainee's head against a wall.\n\nThe goal was simple: to reduce that prisoner to a profound state of complete paralysis and disempowerment in which, having no hope of relief or escape, he would do whatever his captors wanted. Detainees would see that there was no way out but to answer their captors' questions, which, it turned out, often led them, in desperation and a state of learned helplessness, to confess to things they hadn't done, to confess to whatever their captors wanted to hear.\n\nHaving studied and written about the nightmare of those prisoners and Guantánamo for so many years now, it's been supremely jarring to see the term \"learned helplessness\" re-emerge in connection to the current unnerving state of American politics and the 2024 presidential election. Yet, in many ways, it seems a strangely appropriate lens through which to view the world of Donald Trump and the rest of us. It was true, as many commented, that a sense of learned helplessness indisputably crept into the mindset of so many of us in this country -- at least prior to Joe Biden's decision not to pursue a second term as president.\n\nThe American people have indeed suffered multiple stressful, even traumatic experiences in recent years. The shock of a government that didn't protect them on September 11, 2001; the devastating experience of a president who refused to protect them from Covid, as bodies piled up on the streets of this country; the winnowing away of rights and liberties once protected by the Constitution and the Supreme Court -- from the overturning of Roe v. Wade to a rash of recent decisions, including one that gave a president essential immunity in relation to more or less anything he did, no matter how devastating; the inability of the courts to proceed in their prosecutions of Donald Trump; the nearly paralyzed state of a riven Congress amid an economic reality that has led so many younger Americans to be unable to purchase their own homes or send their children to college -- all have collectively cowed the population. Even before both the Supreme Court's presidential immunity decision and the dismal debate performance of Biden, a sense of learned helplessness seemed well in place, and understandably so.\n\nThe Republican Party has also succumbed to a state of learned helplessness. One after another, former opponents of Trump and the MAGA ideology he stands for have succumbed to his agenda and given up on pursuing their own independent goals. Republican vice-presidential nominee J.D. Vance is certainly a case in point. Having formerly called out Trump for his lack of morality, his xenophobia, and his racism, as well as for being a \"total fraud\" and \"America's Hitler,\" he is now on board with the ideas he once said he deplored, including, for example, an untethered anti-immigration stance that calls for massive deportations of illegal immigrants. Similarly, Trump's Republican election opponent Nikki Haley has given up her \"legacy of blunt assessments and brutal takedowns\" of the former president, as The Nation's John Nichols has aptly described her opposition to Trump, whom she once described as \"a dangerous stooge of Russian president Vladimir Putin.\"\n\nThe question is: What, if anything, does the research tell us about curing such a state?\n\nIs There, in Fact, a Cure?\n\nPsychologists do point to remedies for such a profound state of hopelessness. They suggest several healing paths forward, including therapy to examine the causes of one's despair and to discover constructive paths beyond it; exercise to stimulate the body and the mind; and a commitment to \"learned optimism,\" a pattern of reaction geared to expecting the best rather than the worst out of any situation. As Psychology Today points out, \"Seligman later developed the concept of learned optimism. By explaining events to ourselves in a constructive manner and developing a positive internal dialogue, people can break free from their cycle of helplessness.\" Small wins and an energized commitment to positivity are basic tenets of finding a way to \"learned optimism.\"\n\nIf a turn towards optimism offers a way out of the helplessness of our times, perhaps we are seeing the beginning of just such an event. Recently, Slate's Dahlia Lithwick, again invoking the term \"learned helplessness,\" suggested that reports of the plans of the Biden administration to back Supreme Court reform were a sign of the kind of future \"systemwide cognitive reboot for American voters that seems almost inconceivable in the generalized torpor and despair of July 2024.\" The headline of her article read, appropriately enough, \"Are We Finally Letting Go of Our Learned-Helplessness Syndrome Around the Supreme Court?\"\n\nSo, too, the outpouring of energy and excitement following Biden's decision to bow out of the presidential race and the enthusiasm for newer, younger Democratic Party leadership -- and for Vice President Kamala Harris, in particular -- already seems eons removed from the head-shaking resignation of Democratic voters confronting a \"choice\" between an aging Joe Biden and You Know Who on election day. In fact, in many ways, that new turn of affairs could be just what the doctor ordered, though, of course, a possible November election victory for Donald Trump could still put the phrase \"learned helplessness\" in a grimly new light.\n\nFor Democrats, the idea that there could be a brighter future, one in which a sense of control replaced one of powerlessness -- an election in which their presidential candidate has a viable chance of winning -- has taken hold. In place of anxiety and depression, there is optimism, or at least a \"cautious hope.\" Declaring her \"immense pride and limitless optimism for our country's future,\" Nancy Pelosi echoed the importance of this newfound optimism when endorsing Kamala Harris as the party's candidate for 2024. As Tim Alberta summed it up in The Atlantic, \"As far back as springtime, the numbers told a straightforward story: Biden was not going to win. Democrats could only look on, powerless.\" However, now, he concludes, it is the Republicans who are feeling hope and control fade away: \"Sunday brought an unfamiliar feeling of powerlessness. For the first time in a long time, Trump does not control the narrative of 2024.\"\n\nWhether or not such optimism gains momentum in the potentially tumultuous days ahead remains to be seen, as does whether the Republicans can find a way out of their own potential sense of learned helplessness in the face of a changing scenario. Whatever happens, given what I know about the past use of that phrase and the nightmare of the war on terror's use of torture, my own hope is that, with election 2024, the very concept of learned helplessness and the realities it represents, whether it applies to torture at the hands of the U.S. government or suffering at the hands of Trumpian politics, can finally be politically laid to rest.\n\nCall it learned optimism, if you wish, but fingers crossed.","Not quite two years later, the threat of political violence would come for her husband at their home.\n\n\"Where's Nancy?

The Japanese index fell back after its biggest early advance, gaining 8.7% by midmorning on Tuesday. On Monday, nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as world markets quaked under fears the U.S. economy is slowing too much. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years.

They include Lebanon's Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels of Yemen, Shiite militias in Iraq and others. Those relationships are managed by Iran's powerful paramilitary organization, the Revolutionary Guard. Iran relies on those proxy forces as international sanctions on Tehran, including over its nuclear program, have kept it from receiving advanced weaponry.

Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election.

It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\nWitnesses will tell a federal safety board about the blowout on a Boeing 737 Max earlier this year\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board is about to hold a two-day hearing into the blowout of a panel from the side of a Boeing 737 Max airliner.

It will hear from witnesses including its own investigators who have been looking into the Jan. 5 accident that occurred during an Alaska Airlines flight. The board is calling it a fact-finding hearing. The NTSB will not vote on a probable cause for the accident.

They commented Tuesday as the city remembered its atomic bombing 79 years ago at the end of World War II. The memorial comes days after Japan and the U.S. reaffirmed Washington's commitment to \"extended deterrence,\" including atomic weapons, to protect its Asian ally. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has vowed to do his utmost to pursue \"realistic and practical measures\" to build global momentum for nuclear disarmament. Critics say it is a hollow promise.\n\nFrench Polynesian Kauli Vaast and Caroline Marks of U.S. win gold at Paris Olympics surfing\n\nTEAHUPO'O, Tahiti (AP) -- Kauli Vaast from French Polynesia and Caroline Marks from the United States won gold medals in surfing at the Paris Olympics in Tahiti on Monday.

The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial.

Where's Nancy?\"\n\nThat was the chilling question the intruder posed to Paul Pelosi before bludgeoning the then-82-year-old over the head with a hammer in their San Francisco house. It echoed the menacing jeers of the rioters roaming the halls of the Capitol calling out \"Nancy, Nancy\" on Jan. 6.\n\nThe through line of escalating political rhetoric and violence in American public life serves as the opening and closing message of Pelosi's new book, \"The Art of Power, My Story as America's First Woman Speaker of the House.\"\n\nPelosi recounts her nearly four-decade legislative record in Congress but also allows a rare public glimpse into the private devastation around the assault on her husband. With it, she delivers a grave warning that the casual mockery and mimicry of political violence in America is chasing a generation from public service.\n\n\"The current climate of threats and attacks must stop,\" Pelosi writes.\n\n\"We cannot ask people to serve in public life if the cost is risking the safety of their families and those they love.\"\n\nPelosi's book pages through familiar terrain for those who have followed the 84-year-old's career, rising from \"housewife to House member to House speaker.\" The steely California Democrat, the speaker emerita, is no longer in leadership but running for reelection to the House this fall.\n\nShe twice won the speakers gavel, worked alongside seven presidents and, more recently, played a pivotal role in quietly convincing President Joe Biden to reassess his decision to remain in the 2024 presidential election rematch with Republican Donald Trump. Biden bowed out.\n\nBut it's the first and final chapters that bring a new element to the Pelosi era, detailing in personal and painstaking ways the toll that America's violent strain is taking on civic life and public service.\n\n\"I don't know that we will ever feel safe,\" she writes.\n\nWritten well before the July assassination attempt on Trump, Pelosi's assessment of the nation's dangerous discourse arrives after back-to-back congressional shootings of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise and earlier of Democratic former Rep. Gabby Giffords, and it serves as a walk-off warning in what could be among her final years in Congress.\n\nPelosi recounts her disbelief at being \"pulled off the Speaker's platform\" and out of the House chamber by security the afternoon of Jan. 6 as rioters sent by Trump stormed through the halls, some searching for her.\n\n\"I can handle it,\" she protested, telling U.S. Capitol Police she wanted to stay and finish the work as Congress was certifying the 2020 election.\n\n\"Their response was curt,\" she writes. \"'No, you can't.'\"\n\nAfter being whisked away to safety at Fort McNair, she writes about huddling with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the three of them desperately calling the Pentagon to send National Guard troops to restore order at the Capitol. She describes House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump loyalist, as almost entirely unseen.\n\nSo worried about the rioters' threats against Vice President Mike Pence in hiding at the Capitol, she called and told him, \"Don't let anybody know where you are.\"\n\n\"It still took three hours from the time I was dragged out of the House chamber for the Guard to arrive at the Capitol complex,\" she writes. \"It took about three and a half hours to clear the rioters from the building.\"\n\nLater, surveying the wreckage of broken glass and splintered wood, she was told of blood outside the Speaker's Lobby. In some places, including her office, the mob had \"literally defecated on the floors and rugs,\" she wrote. \"What was left behind was pure destruction.\"\n\nShe recalled being in war zones, and in Kyiv at the start of the Russian invasion thinking she may well die in Ukraine. \"I briefly thought the same on January 6,\" she wrote.\n\n\"When I became Speaker, I knew that I was making myself into a target,\" she writes. \"However, our accepting the risk is something that is fundamentally different for our families.\"\n\nNot quite two years later, she was awakened in the middle of the night by the \"Knock. Knock. Knock. Pound, Pound. Pound,\" of the Capitol Police security detail at her door in Washington.\n\nPelosi recounts the dizzying hours, frantic family phone calls and flight back to San Francisco, the hospital, the surgeries and the long recovery for her husband. Their youngest daughter said he looked like a bandaged-up Frankenstein.\n\nHer son, Paul Jr., went to the family's home to vacuum up the broken glass and clean up the blood. Her daughter Alexandra, who had been a high schooler when Pelosi first ran for Congress, told her, had she known what they were signing up for she would \"never have given you my blessing.\"\n\nThe attacker was tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. But Pelosi writes, the story of Paul's attack would not go away.\n\n\"Our home remains a heartbreaking crime scene,\" she wrote.\n\nPelosi said her children told her that for a long time Paul would only sleep in the bedroom when she was there. He still suffers from headaches and dizzy spells, and she said she has seen him faint and fall twice from vertigo. As of February, she wrote, she was still changing bandages from surgery on his arm.\n\nBut the \"true horror\" she writes was the dehumanizing jokes by Republicans from Trump on down, including the former president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who posted a Paul Pelosi Halloween costume to social media, and the way the crowds would \"laugh, cheer, and applaud\" their cruel remarks.\n\n\"It made me profoundly sad for our country,\" she writes.\n\nPelosi situates the two bloody episodes in the arc of her career, from the way Republicans vilified her in countless campaign ads from the time she first rose as Democratic leader to the way protesters spit on Democrats, including civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, the day the House voted for the Affordable Care Act, to the severed pig's head left outside her family's home in the days before Jan. 6.\n\nPelosi writes that when she speaks to young people about running for office, \"especially young women, too often I hear their reluctance to put their families in harm's way.\"\n\n\"This is not the way our country should be -- if you engage in public service, you should not be a target, and your family should not be a target.\"","Kamala Harris is now Democratic presidential nominee, will face off against Donald Trump this fall\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is now official after the Democratic National Committee announced the formal results of the online voting by delegates on Monday night.

She reached that marker at warp speed, with an Associated Press survey of delegates nationwide showing she locked down the necessary commitments a mere 32 hours after Biden's announcement.\n\nHarris' nomination became official after a five-day round of online balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates ended Monday night, with the party saying in a statement released just before midnight that 99% of delegates casting ballots had done so for Harris. The party had long contemplated the early virtual roll call to ensure Biden would appear on the ballot in every state. It said it would next formally certify the vote before holding a celebratory roll call at the party's convention later this month in Chicago.\n\nAn Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted after Biden withdrew found 46% of Americans have a favorable view of Harris, while a nearly identical share has an unfavorable view of her. But more Democrats say they are satisfied with her candidacy compared with that of Biden, energizing a party that had long been resigned to the 81-year-old Biden being its nominee against former President Donald Trump, a Republican they view as an existential threat.\n\nAlready Harris has telegraphed that she doesn't plan to veer much from the themes and policies that framed Biden's candidacy, such as democracy, gun violence prevention and abortion rights. But her delivery can be far fierier, particularly when she invokes her prosecutorial background to lambast Trump and his 34 felony convictions for falsifying business records in connection with a hush money scheme.\n\n\"Given that unique voice of a new generation, of a prosecutor and a woman when fundamental rights, especially reproductive rights, are on the line, it's almost as if the stars have aligned for her at this moment in history,\" said Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California, who was tapped to succeed Harris in the Senate when she became vice president.\n\nA splash in Washington before a collapse in the 2020 primaries\n\nKamala Devi Harris was born Oct. 20, 1964, in Oakland, California, to Shyamala Gopalan, a breast cancer scientist who emigrated to the United States from India when she was 19 years old, and Stanford University emeritus professor Donald Harris, a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Jamaica. Her parents' advocacy for civil rights gave her what she described as a \"stroller's-eye view\" of the movement.\n\nShe spent years as a prosecutor in the Bay Area before her elevation as the state's attorney general in 2010 and then election as U.S. senator in 2016.\n\nHarris arrived in Washington as a senator at the dawn of the volatile Trump era, quickly establishing herself as a reliable liberal opponent of the new president's personnel and policies and fanning speculation about a presidential bid of her own. Securing a spot on the coveted Judiciary Committee gave her a national spotlight to interrogate prominent Trump nominees, such as now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\n\"I'm not able to be rushed this fast,\" then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions said during a 2017 hearing as Harris repeatedly pressed him on potential conversations with Russian nationals. \"It makes me nervous.\"\n\nHarris launched her 2020 presidential campaign with much promise, drawing parallels to former President Barack Obama and attracting more than 20,000 people to a kickoff rally in her hometown. But Harris withdrew from the primary race before the first nominating contest in Iowa, plagued by staff dissent that spilled out into the open and an inability to attract enough campaign cash.\n\nHarris struggled to deliver a consistent pitch to Democratic voters and wobbled on key issues such as health care. She suggested she backed eliminating private insurance for a full government-run system -- \"Medicare for All\" coverage -- before releasing her own health care plan that preserved private insurance. Now, during her nascent general election campaign, Harris has already reversed some of her earlier, more liberal positions, such as a ban on fracking that she endorsed in 2019.\n\nAnd while Harris tried to deploy her law enforcement background as an asset in her 2020 presidential campaign, it never attracted enough support in a party that couldn't reconcile some of her past tough-on-crime positions at a time of heightened focus on police brutality.\n\nJoining Biden's team -- and an evolution as vice president\n\nStill, Harris was at the top of the vice presidential shortlist when Biden was pondering his running mate, after his pledge in early 2020 that he would choose a Black woman as his No. 2. He was fond of Harris, who had forged a close friendship with his now-deceased son Beau, who had been Delaware's attorney general when she was in that job for California.\n\nHer first months as vice president were far from smooth. Biden asked her to lead the administration's diplomatic efforts with Central America on the root causes of migration to the United States, which triggered attacks from Republicans on border security and remains a political vulnerability. It didn't help matters that Harris stumbled in big interviews, such as in a 2021 sit-down with NBC News' Lester Holt when she responded dismissively that \"I haven't been to Europe\" when the anchor noted that she hadn't visited the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nFor her first two years, Harris also was often tethered to Washington so she could break tie votes in the evenly divided Senate, which gave Democrats landmark wins on the climate and health care but also constrained opportunities for her to travel around the country and meet voters.\n\nHer visibility became far more prominent after the 2022 Supreme Court ruling that dismantled Roe v. Wade, as she became the chief spokesperson for the administration on abortion rights and was a more natural messenger than Biden, a lifelong Catholic who had in the past favored restrictions on the procedure. She is the first vice president to tour an abortion clinic and speaks about reproductive rights in the broader context of maternal health, especially for Black women.\n\nThroughout her vice presidency, Harris has been careful to remain loyal to Biden while emphasizing that she would be ready to step in if needed. That dramatic transition began in late June after the first debate between Biden and Trump, where the president's stumbles were so cataclysmic that he could never reverse the loss of confidence from other Democrats.\n\nHeaded to the top of the ticket\n\nAfter Biden ended his candidacy July 21, he quickly endorsed Harris. And during the first two weeks of her 2024 presidential bid, enthusiasm among the Democratic base surged, with donations pouring in, scores of volunteers showing up at field offices and supporters swelling so much in numbers that event organizers have had to swap venues.\n\nThe Harris campaign now believes it has a renewed opportunity to compete in Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia -- states that Biden had started to abandon in favor of shoring up the so-called \"blue wall\" states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\n\n\"The country is able to see the Kamala Harris that we all know,\" said Bakari Sellers, who was a national co-chair of her 2020 campaign. \"We really didn't allow the country to see her\" four years ago. Sellers said: \"We had her in bubble wrap. What people are seeing now is that she's real, she's talented.\"\n\nYet Democrats are anticipating that Harris' political honeymoon will wear off, and she is inevitably going to come under tougher scrutiny for Biden administration positions, the state of the economy and volatile situations abroad, particularly in the Middle East.

It caps a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is a daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.","Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is now official after the Democratic National Committee announced the formal results of the online voting by delegates on Monday night\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris, a daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history, formally secured the Democratic presidential nomination on Monday -- becoming the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket.\n\nMore than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed, Harris' coronation as her party's standard-bearer caps a tumultuous and frenetic period for Democrats prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous June debate performance that shattered his own supporters' confidence in his reelection prospects and spurred extraordinary intraparty warfare about whether he should stay in the race.\n\nJust as soon as Biden abruptly ended his candidacy, Harris and her team worked rapidly to secure backing from the 1,976 party delegates needed to clinch the nomination in a formal roll call vote. She reached that marker at warp speed, with an Associated Press survey of delegates nationwide showing she locked down the necessary commitments a mere 32 hours after Biden's announcement.\n\nHarris' nomination became official after a five-day round of online balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates ended Monday night, with the party saying in a statement released just before midnight that 99% of delegates casting ballots had done so for Harris. The party had long contemplated the early virtual roll call to ensure Biden would appear on the ballot in every state. It said it would next formally certify the vote before holding a celebratory roll call at the party's convention later this month in Chicago.\n\nAn Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted after Biden withdrew found 46% of Americans have a favorable view of Harris, while a nearly identical share has an unfavorable view of her. But more Democrats say they are satisfied with her candidacy compared with that of Biden, energizing a party that had long been resigned to the 81-year-old Biden being its nominee against former President Donald Trump, a Republican they view as an existential threat.\n\nAlready Harris has telegraphed that she doesn't plan to veer much from the themes and policies that framed Biden's candidacy, such as democracy, gun violence prevention and abortion rights. But her delivery can be far fierier, particularly when she invokes her prosecutorial background to lambast Trump and his 34 felony convictions for falsifying business records in connection with a hush money scheme.\n\n\"Given that unique voice of a new generation, of a prosecutor and a woman when fundamental rights, especially reproductive rights, are on the line, it's almost as if the stars have aligned for her at this moment in history,\" said Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California, who was tapped to succeed Harris in the Senate when she became vice president.\n\nA splash in Washington before a collapse in the 2020 primaries\n\nKamala Devi Harris was born Oct. 20, 1964, in Oakland, California, to Shyamala Gopalan, a breast cancer scientist who emigrated to the United States from India when she was 19 years old, and Stanford University emeritus professor Donald Harris, a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Jamaica. Her parents' advocacy for civil rights gave her what she described as a \"stroller's-eye view\" of the movement.\n\nShe spent years as a prosecutor in the Bay Area before her elevation as the state's attorney general in 2010 and then election as U.S. senator in 2016.\n\nHarris arrived in Washington as a senator at the dawn of the volatile Trump era, quickly establishing herself as a reliable liberal opponent of the new president's personnel and policies and fanning speculation about a presidential bid of her own. Securing a spot on the coveted Judiciary Committee gave her a national spotlight to interrogate prominent Trump nominees, such as now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\n\"I'm not able to be rushed this fast,\" then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions said during a 2017 hearing as Harris repeatedly pressed him on potential conversations with Russian nationals. \"It makes me nervous.\"\n\nHarris launched her 2020 presidential campaign with much promise, drawing parallels to former President Barack Obama and attracting more than 20,000 people to a kickoff rally in her hometown. But Harris withdrew from the primary race before the first nominating contest in Iowa, plagued by staff dissent that spilled out into the open and an inability to attract enough campaign cash.\n\nHarris struggled to deliver a consistent pitch to Democratic voters and wobbled on key issues such as health care. She suggested she backed eliminating private insurance for a full government-run system -- \"Medicare for All\" coverage -- before releasing her own health care plan that preserved private insurance. Now, during her nascent general election campaign, Harris has already reversed some of her earlier, more liberal positions, such as a ban on fracking that she endorsed in 2019.\n\nAnd while Harris tried to deploy her law enforcement background as an asset in her 2020 presidential campaign, it never attracted enough support in a party that couldn't reconcile some of her past tough-on-crime positions at a time of heightened focus on police brutality.\n\nJoining Biden's team -- and an evolution as vice president\n\nStill, Harris was at the top of the vice presidential shortlist when Biden was pondering his running mate, after his pledge in early 2020 that he would choose a Black woman as his No. 2. He was fond of Harris, who had forged a close friendship with his now-deceased son Beau, who had been Delaware's attorney general when she was in that job for California.\n\nHer first months as vice president were far from smooth. Biden asked her to lead the administration's diplomatic efforts with Central America on the root causes of migration to the United States, which triggered attacks from Republicans on border security and remains a political vulnerability. It didn't help matters that Harris stumbled in big interviews, such as in a 2021 sit-down with NBC News' Lester Holt when she responded dismissively that \"I haven't been to Europe\" when the anchor noted that she hadn't visited the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nFor her first two years, Harris also was often tethered to Washington so she could break tie votes in the evenly divided Senate, which gave Democrats landmark wins on the climate and health care but also constrained opportunities for her to travel around the country and meet voters.\n\nHer visibility became far more prominent after the 2022 Supreme Court ruling that dismantled Roe v. Wade, as she became the chief spokesperson for the administration on abortion rights and was a more natural messenger than Biden, a lifelong Catholic who had in the past favored restrictions on the procedure. She is the first vice president to tour an abortion clinic and speaks about reproductive rights in the broader context of maternal health, especially for Black women.\n\nThroughout her vice presidency, Harris has been careful to remain loyal to Biden while emphasizing that she would be ready to step in if needed. That dramatic transition began in late June after the first debate between Biden and Trump, where the president's stumbles were so cataclysmic that he could never reverse the loss of confidence from other Democrats.\n\nHeaded to the top of the ticket\n\nAfter Biden ended his candidacy July 21, he quickly endorsed Harris. And during the first two weeks of her 2024 presidential bid, enthusiasm among the Democratic base surged, with donations pouring in, scores of volunteers showing up at field offices and supporters swelling so much in numbers that event organizers have had to swap venues.\n\nThe Harris campaign now believes it has a renewed opportunity to compete in Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia -- states that Biden had started to abandon in favor of shoring up the so-called \"blue wall\" states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\n\n\"The country is able to see the Kamala Harris that we all know,\" said Bakari Sellers, who was a national co-chair of her 2020 campaign. \"We really didn't allow the country to see her\" four years ago. Sellers said: \"We had her in bubble wrap. What people are seeing now is that she's real, she's talented.\"\n\nYet Democrats are anticipating that Harris' political honeymoon will wear off, and she is inevitably going to come under tougher scrutiny for Biden administration positions, the state of the economy and volatile situations abroad, particularly in the Middle East. Harris has also yet to answer extended questions from journalists nor sit down for a formal interview since she began her run.\n\nThe Trump campaign has been eager to define Harris as she continues to introduce herself to voters nationwide, releasing an ad blaming her for the high number of illegal crossings at the southern border during the Biden administration and dubbing her \"Failed.

Another death was reported in Georgia as the storm began lashing that state with potentially devastating rains. Officials say hundreds of people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, and neighboring Manatee County. Debby was expected to slow to a crawl as it turns to the east, and forecasters warn that heavy rain could spawn more flooding in Florida and especially coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Substantial flooding is possible in parts of North Carolina as well.\n\nJapan's share benchmark soars nearly 11% a day after massive sell-offs that shook Wall Street\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index has soared more than 10% a day after it set markets tumbling in Europe and on Wall Street, while other world markets appeared to have settled after the rollercoaster ride that started the week. The Japanese index fell back after its biggest early advance, gaining 8.7% by midmorning. On Monday, nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as world markets quaked under fears the U.S. economy is slowing too much. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed the Nikkei's 12.4% plunge, its worst since 1987.\n\nGoogle illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge has ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\nProxy forces armed by Iran could take part in retaliation against Israel over Hamas leader's killing\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- As Iran threatens to respond to the suspected Israeli assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, the regional militias that the Islamic Republic has armed for decades could play a role in any attack. They include Lebanon's Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels of Yemen, Shiite militias in Iraq and others. Those relationships are managed by Iran's powerful paramilitary organization, the Revolutionary Guard. Iran relies on those proxy forces as international sanctions on Tehran, including over its nuclear program, have kept it from receiving advanced weaponry. While developing its own missile program, Iran also relies on militias as an asymmetric threat to squeeze Israel and the United States.\n\nVenezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo \"falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council\" and they openly incited \"police and military officials to disobey the laws.\"\n\nBangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family on Monday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. After the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.\n\nHiroshima governor says nuclear disarmament must be tackled as a pressing issue, not an ideal\n\nTOKYO (AP) -- Hiroshima officials are urging world leaders to stop relying on nuclear weapons as deterrence and take immediate action toward abolishment -- not as an ideal, but to remove the risk of atomic war amid the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. They commented Tuesday as the city remembered its atomic bombing 79 years ago at the end of World War II. The memorial comes days after Japan and the U.S. reaffirmed Washington's commitment to \"extended deterrence,\" including atomic weapons, to protect its Asian ally. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has vowed to do his utmost to pursue \"realistic and practical measures\" to build global momentum for nuclear disarmament. Critics say it is a hollow promise.\n\nFrench Polynesian Kauli Vaast and Caroline Marks of U.S. win gold at Paris Olympics surfing\n\nTEAHUPO'O, Tahiti (AP) -- Kauli Vaast from French Polynesia and Caroline Marks from the United States won gold medals in surfing at the Paris Olympics in Tahiti on Monday.

With it, she delivers a grave warning that the casual mockery and mimicry of political violence in America is chasing a generation from public service.\n\n\"The current climate of threats and attacks must stop,\" Pelosi writes.\n\n\"We cannot ask people to serve in public life if the cost is risking the safety of their families and those they love.\"\n\nPelosi's book pages through familiar terrain for those who have followed the 84-year-old's career, rising from \"housewife to House member to House speaker.\" The steely California Democrat, the speaker emerita, is no longer in leadership but running for reelection to the House this fall.\n\nShe twice won the speakers gavel, worked alongside seven presidents and, more recently, played a pivotal role in quietly convincing President Joe Biden to reassess his decision to remain in the 2024 presidential election rematch with Republican Donald Trump. Biden bowed out.\n\nBut it's the first and final chapters that bring a new element to the Pelosi era, detailing in personal and painstaking ways the toll that America's violent strain is taking on civic life and public service.\n\n\"I don't know that we will ever feel safe,\" she writes.\n\nWritten well before the July assassination attempt on Trump, Pelosi's assessment of the nation's dangerous discourse arrives after back-to-back congressional shootings of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise and earlier of Democratic former Rep. Gabby Giffords, and it serves as a walk-off warning in what could be among her final years in Congress.\n\nPelosi recounts her disbelief at being \"pulled off the Speaker's platform\" and out of the House chamber by security the afternoon of Jan. 6 as rioters sent by Trump stormed through the halls, some searching for her.\n\n\"I can handle it,\" she protested, telling U.S. Capitol Police she wanted to stay and finish the work as Congress was certifying the 2020 election.\n\n\"Their response was curt,\" she writes. \"'No, you can't.'\"\n\nAfter being whisked away to safety at Fort McNair, she writes about huddling with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the three of them desperately calling the Pentagon to send National Guard troops to restore order at the Capitol. She describes House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump loyalist, as almost entirely unseen.\n\nSo worried about the rioters' threats against Vice President Mike Pence in hiding at the Capitol, she called and told him, \"Don't let anybody know where you are.\"\n\n\"It still took three hours from the time I was dragged out of the House chamber for the Guard to arrive at the Capitol complex,\" she writes. \"It took about three and a half hours to clear the rioters from the building.\"\n\nLater, surveying the wreckage of broken glass and splintered wood, she was told of blood outside the Speaker's Lobby. In some places, including her office, the mob had \"literally defecated on the floors and rugs,\" she wrote. \"What was left behind was pure destruction.\"\n\nShe recalled being in war zones, and in Kyiv at the start of the Russian invasion thinking she may well die in Ukraine. \"I briefly thought the same on January 6,\" she wrote.\n\n\"When I became Speaker, I knew that I was making myself into a target,\" she writes. \"However, our accepting the risk is something that is fundamentally different for our families.\"\n\nNot quite two years later, she was awakened in the middle of the night by the \"Knock. Knock. Knock. Pound, Pound. Pound,\" of the Capitol Police security detail at her door in Washington.\n\nPelosi recounts the dizzying hours, frantic family phone calls and flight back to San Francisco, the hospital, the surgeries and the long recovery for her husband. Their youngest daughter said he looked like a bandaged-up Frankenstein.\n\nHer son, Paul Jr., went to the family's home to vacuum up the broken glass and clean up the blood. Her daughter Alexandra, who had been a high schooler when Pelosi first ran for Congress, told her, had she known what they were signing up for she would \"never have given you my blessing.\"\n\nThe attacker was tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. But Pelosi writes, the story of Paul's attack would not go away.\n\n\"Our home remains a heartbreaking crime scene,\" she wrote.\n\nPelosi said her children told her that for a long time Paul would only sleep in the bedroom when she was there. He still suffers from headaches and dizzy spells, and she said she has seen him faint and fall twice from vertigo. As of February, she wrote, she was still changing bandages from surgery on his arm.\n\nBut the \"true horror\" she writes was the dehumanizing jokes by Republicans from Trump on down, including the former president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who posted a Paul Pelosi Halloween costume to social media, and the way the crowds would \"laugh, cheer, and applaud\" their cruel remarks.\n\n\"It made me profoundly sad for our country,\" she writes.\n\nPelosi situates the two bloody episodes in the arc of her career, from the way Republicans vilified her in countless campaign ads from the time she first rose as Democratic leader to the way protesters spit on Democrats, including civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, the day the House voted for the Affordable Care Act, to the severed pig's head left outside her family's home in the days before Jan. 6.\n\nPelosi writes that when she speaks to young people about running for office, \"especially young women, too often I hear their reluctance to put their families in harm's way.\"\n\n\"This is not the way our country should be -- if you engage in public service, you should not be a target, and your family should not be a target.\"","Stocks tumbled over fears of a U.S. economic slowdown\n\nA wave of anxiety rippled through financial markets yesterday, and stocks fell around the world as investors zeroed in on signs of a slowing American economy.\n\nThe drop extended a sell-off that began on Friday after the U.S. released a job report that showed the highest level of unemployment in nearly three years. That deepened fears that the world's largest economy could be headed for slower growth.\n\nThere were other factors at play in the plunge: concerns that tech stocks had run up too far, too fast, and that a strengthening yen could hurt the prospects of Japanese companies and some global traders. In the U.S., some questioned whether the Federal Reserve might have waited too long to cut interest rates. Here's the latest on the market meltdown.\n\nBy the numbers: In the U.S., the S&P 500 fell 3 percent, its worst day since September 2022. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index dropped 12.4 percent, its biggest one-day point decline. The FTSE 100, Britain's benchmark index, had its worst day since July 2023, falling just over 2 percent.\n\nTime to sell? It's tough to do nothing during this kind of market turmoil.

The final stage has reached something of an ugly phase, sowing divisions within the party as donors, interest groups and political rivals lobby for their preferred candidates.\n\nThree contenders -- Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona and Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota -- met with the vice president in Washington on Sunday. After announcing her pick, Harris plans to hold a first rally with her new running mate in Philadelphia today.\n\nHere's what else to know:\n\nThe elevation of Harris to the top of the Democratic ticket has transformed what had been a long slog into a fast-moving campaign. Analysts said that the timeline was likely to benefit Harris.\n\nIn a live interview with Adin Ross, a 23-year-old internet streamer, Donald Trump appeared to blame immigrants for the drop in global stock markets.\n\nIn a new book, Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker, said that her push for President Biden to withdraw had come down to one factor: the need to defeat Donald Trump.\n\nDo you have questions about the election?

Reflecting on his great achievements, musical hero status and what he meant to ordinary people, it willed him a strong recovery.\n\nSuch was the timing and popularity of the man himself that some 75,000 strong readers took in the content, later ranked as IA's article of the year. When the legendary figure's iconic musical melody later featured in the \"Yes\" campaign just prior to Australia's Voice Referendum last year, a follow-up piece was written about how the superstar represented a voice for change.\n\nSomewhat optimistically, that opinion editorial welcomed the transition home amidst a stir of \"beat up\" controversy about turning an iconic party anthem into part of a larger political movement. Despite the Referendum failing to come to fruition, the advertisement proved hugely popular -- and rightfully so. Then on Thursday, as Australia woke, Johnny was back -- but this time on the world stage.\n\nOne glance at the morning socials was enough to tell you he had done it again. His iconic 'You're the Voice' anthem was up and about and trending again -- just one more, \"last\" time. A new craftily designed viral music video clip was doing the rounds. Opening with unfavourable Trumpisms, the clip made a strong political statement.\n\nIt depicted the need for the American Democratic Party to pass on the torch of change from President Joe Biden to Vice President Kamala Harris, for a generation of progressive and diverse leaders to ultimately gift the people hope for a better future. Perhaps one could presume with a bit more senility than the first two presidential contenders, from times long past.\n\nOne would then hopefully be free from fear of the little things. Like risking an all-out nuclear world war through a lack of basic diplomacy. Then, overnight, an armchair hacktivist and musical sentimentalist's dream conspired to come true. One could feel the full force of this rumbling excitement in their nerdish but democratic \"old school\" musical loins. Finally! Something that may outstrip Gough Whitlam's 'It's Time' jingle of its former glory at the helm of political marketing and pop culture genius.\n\nThis new clip appeared punchy and the torch reference was particularly timely, considering many just watched the Olympic ceremony. The masses could, of course, be forgiven for mistakenly believing our main man Johnny was now front, stage and centre in a Democrat-endorsed ad for Kamala Harris' U.S. Presidential Election bid. Although that wasn't the exact reality.\n\nIt was, in fact, an unofficial advertisement that for all intent and purposes could well have been mocked up in a loungeroom of an old HP laptop, although Independent Australia cannot confirm such detail. Regardless, it didn't worry the people. For the two-minute and 15-second duration of the video, we reminisced and got caught up in the unification, joy and emotion of the togetherness.\n\n#1 TOP IA STORY OF 2022: John Farnham -- The Voice of Australia\n\nJohn Farnham was close to death earlier this year and so our top story of 2022 receiving over 75,000 views reflected the depth of affection in our nation for the iconic Australian vocalist. Well done to Naomi Fryers for so brilliantly capturing this love in this moving September piece.\n\nWe may as well have been hugging our mates in the pub after some kind of show of lifesaving comradery, for we were all the voice, yet again. It wasn't even initially obvious that the lyrics about not wanting to look at each other down the barrel of the gun were glaringly ironic in the wake of the Trump assassination attempt.\n\nTrue to form though, the grubby imperialist Poms were quick to try to dust the gloss off this quintessentially momentous Aussie moment by, quite typically, whinging and claiming the singer as theirs -- just like the Ashes and everything else in Australia's longest-living history.\n\nThe reason that this advertisement labelled 'outstanding' commenced trending and ultimately went viral was that the music resonated, seemingly as much with a global audience as it did in Australia. Such was its power that it reportedly gave people goosebumps. The fact that it was cleverly constructed unofficially by a trickster likely had no bearing on the good old chain reaction.\n\nThe anthem was emotively the best of us and it was seen. With it came the relatable gift of unification, reminiscence and hope. From the likes of Joe Biden to Kamala Harris, to John Farnham himself and X patrons on the old Twittersphere. It brought back the voice -- and not just to Australia. This time the world responded and who could blame them for wanting more of it?\n\nNaomi Fryers is a writer, author, storyteller and journalist from Melbourne.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nRace, gender, age will determine Kamala Harris' running mateCARTOONS: Mark David calls it a day\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Australia License\n\nSupport independent journalism Subscribe to IA.\n\nPOLITICS DEMOCRACY MEDIA INTERNATIONAL KAMALA HARRIS John Farnham You're the Voice 2024 Presidential Election Donald Trump Democrats Joe Biden Twitter X Gough Whitlam\n\nShare Article","Lansing -- Widespread change has struck the group of officials whose job is to certify Michigan's elections, igniting concerns about whether the new class is willing to sign off on the results the same way county canvassers in the battleground state did four years ago.\n\nA first-of-its-kind, weeks-long analysis by The Detroit News found 55% of the 332 county canvassers in Michigan were not serving in November 2020 when boards in all 83 counties approved the outcome despite Republican then-President Donald Trump's unsuccessful attempt to overturn his loss to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe turnover has been driven by Republicans. While 48% of the Democratic canvassers are new since 2020, 63% -- nearly two out of every three -- are new on the GOP side, according to The News' analysis.\n\nThe numbers point to a Michigan Republican Party that's been focused on false claims of widespread fraud aimed at the 2020 election and GOP canvassers who might interfere with the election process this fall, according to Democrats. But Republicans, such as Kalamazoo County canvasser Robert Froman, said the analysis demonstrates an increased and renewed interest in how elections are administered.\n\n\"Many people within the framework or the ideology of the Republican Party have realized that they have been sitting in their living rooms way too long, and the country that they know and love is being stolen out from under them,\" Froman said. \"And they're not willing to sit in their living rooms any longer.\"\n\nFroman, a 72-year-old retired postal service employee from Oshtemo Township, is one of the 105 new Republican county canvassers who are serving in 2024 but weren't in their positions in 2020.\n\nEach county in Michigan has a four-person canvassing board, featuring two Republicans and two Democrats, in charge of approving election tallies before they're forwarded to the state for final authorization. The panels rarely get attention and, former Michigan elections director Chris Thomas said, their members often held the posts for many years at a time, making vast changes like what's occurred recently unusual.\n\nConcerns about the 2020 election spurred Froman to get more actively involved in politics, he said. Froman started attending Kalamazoo County Republican Party meetings and volunteering with an entity named Check My Vote, which has been trying to examine and verify addresses used by Michigan residents in the state's official list of registered voters.\n\nFroman, whom Republicans nominated to serve on the Kalamazoo County canvassing board and whose term began last year, said he's personally checked tens of thousands of voters' addresses. He said he \"most definitely\" believes the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.\n\nAsked if he would certify the 2024 presidential election if it unfolded the same way the 2020 one did, Froman replied, \"No. And that's why I'm there.\"\n\nFroman is one of four so-called \"county leaders\" or \"trainers\" who have been working with Check My Vote to investigate the state's registered voter list and who have recently gotten county canvassing positions. The others are Bonnie Kellogg in Muskegon County, Maureen Hillary in Clinton County and Ron Palmgren in Genesee County, according to a list of \"county leaders\" in a July 2023 announcement from the Michigan Republican Party.\n\nThe belief system that there was widespread fraud in 2020 and a series of attempts to reject results in Michigan over the last four years have some election officials in Michigan expecting that Republicans on some local canvassing boards might try to block the certification process in November if Trump loses to likely Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nCounty canvassing boards must have a bipartisan 3-1 or 4-0 vote to certify election results and advance them to the Board of State Canvassers, another panel comprised of two Republicans and two Democrats.\n\n\"At this point, shockingly, it wouldn't surprise me to see several counties deadlock,\" said Thomas, who served as Michigan's elections director for more than three decades.\n\n'I do worry'\n\nEach of Michigan's 83 county canvassing boards has the responsibility of reviewing the local vote totals and reporting the results to the Board of State Canvassers, according to a manual published by the Michigan Bureau of Elections.\n\nThe county boards, featuring two Republican slots and two Democratic slots, have 14 days following Election Day to certify the results for each of their precincts.\n\nThe canvassers serve staggered four-year terms, are nominated by their local political party and are picked, from among the party nominees, by the local board of commissioners. However, there is no official state list that tracks who sits on the key elections boards across Michigan.\n\nThe News compiled the names of Michigan's county canvassers -- those serving now and those serving in 2020 -- through questionnaires sent to county clerks in June and July and examining board member lists that were posted on some county websites.\n\nBoards with vacancies are considered by The News to have new members because the positions are expected to be filled before the November election.\n\nOf Michigan's 83 counties, 11 have completely new canvassing boards with four new members from 2020: Alger, Arenac, Clare, Dickinson, Iosco, Mackinac, Manistee, Montmorency, Muskegon, Roscommon and Wayne -- the state's most populous county and the site of a brief November 2020 certification deadlock.\n\nIn Iosco County, which is located in northeastern Michigan and has a population of about 25,000, Clerk Nancy Huebel said one past board member died, two resigned for personal reasons, and one, Democrat Patti Casey, wasn't reappointed.\n\nIn neighboring Arenac County, Janice Grier, 69, of Standish said Democrats were having trouble finding people to serve on the canvassing board a couple of years ago, so she stepped up. In 2020, 67% of the votes in the county went to Trump.\n\nGrier said she hasn't seen anything that would make her concerned about the county board not certifying the upcoming presidential election, but she's not so certain about elsewhere in Michigan.\n\n\"I do worry about other parts of the state,\" Grier said.\n\nProtect the vote?\n\nOver the last four years, there have been three examples of canvassers in Michigan at least initially refusing to certify an election.\n\nMost recently, in the spring, two Republicans on the Delta County canvassing board in the Upper Peninsula voted against certifying a May 7 recall election in which three incumbent Republican county commissioners lost their seats. However, days later, they changed course and approved the results.\n\n\"I am doing my best to protect the votes of all citizens of Delta County and to ensure free and fair elections by bringing transparency and reassurance to all Delta County citizens,\" one of the Republican canvassers, Bonnie Hakkola, said at the time.\n\nHakkola resigned from the board afterward.\n\nThe other Republican who initially voted against certification, LeeAnne Oman, was serving as an alternate for an absent GOP canvasser, Sema Deeds.\n\nJonathan Brater, Michigan's elections director, sent a letter to the Delta County canvassers on May 16, telling them that under the Michigan Constitution and state law, they had \"a clear and nondiscretionary duty to certify election results based solely on election returns.\"\n\n\"The Constitution and Michigan election law do not authorize boards of county canvassers to refuse to certify election results based on claims made by third parties of alleged election irregularities or a general desire to conduct election investigations,\" Brater wrote in the letter.\n\nIn a statement in May, Attorney General Dana Nessel said \"defying the will of the people based on conjecture, dissatisfaction in the results or any other reason not based on Michigan law\" will not be tolerated.\n\n\"While the Delta County Board ultimately met their obligations, and as a result have avoided the legal consequences, let this serve as a warning to all of the boards of canvassers across the state that the willful neglect of your duties is a criminal act,\" added Nessel, a Democrat.\n\nCanvassers' role\n\nAsked about the statements from Nessel and Brater about the Delta County canvassers, new Republican Kalamazoo County canvasser Froman said he has a duty to ensure there is a free and fair election.\n\n\"I am not going to do anything that's illegal,\" Froman told The News.\n\nOther new canvassers interviewed by The News in recent weeks made similar remarks.\n\nRon Palmgren, a Republican canvasser in Genesee County, has also served as a county leader for Check My Vote. Asked if the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Trump, Palmgren said he has \"no idea whether it was stolen or not.\"\n\nBiden won Michigan's election by 154,000 votes or 3 percentage points, 51%-48%. The outcome has been upheld by audits, a series of court rulings and an investigation by a Republican-controlled state Senate committee.\n\nPalmgren, a 76-year-old retiree from Burton, said he views his role as a canvasser as being an \"impartial arbiter.\"\n\n\"Based on my experience so far, there is no investigatory process,\" Palmgren said of his responsibilities. \"It is strictly looking at the election results provided by all of the municipalities and making sure that all of the processes that were in place were followed.\"\n\nLikewise, Jim Kargol, a 69-year-old from Petoskey who serves on the Emmet County Board of Canvassers, said he doesn't believe there's been fraud in local elections, but he questions what has happened in other places, such as Detroit.\n\nKargol mentioned a van dropping off loads of ballots in the night during the 2020 presidential election in Detroit, a Democratic stronghold. He appeared to be referencing about 16,000 ballots that had been delivered to the center where absentee ballots were being tallied in Detroit in the early morning hours of Nov. 4. The ballots had been verified by city Clerk Janice Winfrey's staff prior to delivery in a process prescribed by Michigan law, said Thomas, Michigan's former elections director who helped oversee voting in Detroit.\n\n\"I really think there was some foolishness that went on,\" said Kargol, a Republican.\n\nCanvassing troubles\n\nAfter the 2020 presidential election on Nov. 17, 2020, Wayne County's Republican then-canvassers Monica Palmer and William Hartmann questioned precincts in Detroit where the number of ballots cast and the number of votes tracked didn't match and initially voted against certifying the county's results.\n\nBut later in the meeting, they changed course and supported certifying the election based on the condition that an audit take place of some precincts within Wayne County.\n\nMinutes after the meeting, Trump and Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel called Palmer and Hartmann, and Trump personally pressured them not to sign the certification document, according to recordings previously reported on by The Detroit News.\n\n\"We've got to fight for our country,\" Trump said during the phone call, according to the recordings. \"We can't let these people take our country away from us.\"\n\nMore: Trump recorded pressuring Wayne County canvassers not to certify 2020 vote\n\nThe Michigan Bureau of Elections determined the vote that occurred and the signatures of the chair or vice chair of the four-member canvassing board and the county clerk were the only things necessary to advance the certification to the Board of State Canvassers.\n\nHartmann died in 2021, and Republican Party officials didn't renominate Palmer to serve on the canvassing board when her term concluded in 2021. The new Republican canvassers are Katherine Riley and Robert Boyd.\n\nRiley, who's now chair of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers, according to the county's website, didn't respond Monday to a request for comment.\n\nThere are also two new Democrats on the board, Richard W. Preuss and Frank Woods Jr.\n\nJonathan Kinloch, a Democrat who was serving on the Wayne County canvassing board in 2020 and is now a Wayne County commissioner, said the question of whether boards will certify the results this fall is at the forefront of his mind.\n\nWayne County Republicans initially denied that they were going to attempt to block certification in 2020, Kinloch said. Where there's smoke, people should be concerned, he said.\n\n\"I think this is a tactic of theirs to create chaos,\" Kinloch said.\n\nLegal backstops\n\nIf a county canvassing board refuses to certify an upcoming election, Michigan has legal \"backstops\" in place to deal with the development, Thomas said. But such an attempt could also further undermine people's faith in electoral outcomes, he acknowledged.\n\nUnder state processes, if a county board fails to determine a result, the job moves to the Board of State Canvassers, according to the Michigan Bureau of Elections.\n\nThe county board is supposed to immediately deliver all records and other information, including all necessary forms, to the Board of State Canvassers. A court could get involved to make sure that step happens.\n\nWhen the 2020 presidential election reached the state board, one of the two Republicans on the statewide panel abstained: Norm Shinkle of Ingham County. But the other Republican, Aaron Van Langevelde, cast the deciding vote with the two Democrats in favor of certification.\n\nAt the time, Shinkle called for the Republican-led Legislature to conduct an in-depth review of election procedures, and he promoted theories about problems in Wayne County.\n\n\"I do not plan on voting for certification. I believe Wayne County's certification needs to be looked at,\" Shinkle said before abstaining.\n\nVan Langevelde and Shinkle are both no longer on the board. They've been replaced by Tony Daunt and Richard Houskamp.\n\nDaunt and Houskamp voted to certify the 2022 gubernatorial election, which Republican Tudor Dixon lost to Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer by about 10 percentage points. Daunt also has openly criticized Trump for spreading \"lies\" that the 2020 election was rigged.","Highlighting growth of phishing and digital scams targeting United States citizens, Bolster released a research that identified 24 separate nation-state threat actor groups attempting to exploit rising political tensions across the US to interfere with the 2024 presidential election. \"We know the frequency of phishing attacks is increasing, as hackers utilize AI to execute more scams than ever before.

Trump's popularity is a movement based on the aggrieved entitlement of Americans who resent growing equality.\n\nTrump offers these people - White men and often White women, too - the promise of pushing those with less power, women and non-White people, back down the ladder of inequality.\n\nThis means Trump is not the Left's fault. Trump is a reaction to the Left fighting for a more equal society.\n\nIt has become a popular trope amongst political analysts to blame the rise of Donald Trump's far-Right MAGA movement on the Democrats and the Left more broadly. The myth goes that Democratic presidents have not served the interests of the working class, particularly rural White American men, and that the resulting resentment about growing inequality led to the rise of Donald Trump.\n\nAmerica's gathering storm: Trump's culture of self-pity an ace up his sleeve\n\nAs unlikely as it seems that Donald Trump could be re-elected, his cult of personality could be enough to stir up votes and place him back in the Oval Office.\n\nSales says this divisive message resonates effectively with Trump's supporters because life has got harder for Americans with free trade disappearing jobs and industries, rising inflation, credit card defaults and bankruptcies, high interest rates and \"deaths of despair\" from suicide, alcoholism and drug addiction.\n\nNot only does this representation of Trump's political support wrongly imply that Trump's base supports him because he is going to solve American inequality, but it also inaccurately implies that the Democrats do not work hard for equality.\n\nJust like in Australian politics, what separates the Left from the Right in American politics is a desire by the Left to solve inequality, whereas the Right works to make it worse. This glaring fact is lost in attempts to blame Trump - a pro-inequality candidate - on those who oppose inequality at every turn.\n\nAnother example of attempts to apportion some blame for Trump's rise on the Democrats came from Stan Grant in The Saturday Paper. Grant takes aim at former President Barack Obama, criticising him for failing to solve race relations and inequality in America and saying Obama 'bequeathed a country primed for a populist like Trump'.\n\nBig of him, Grant also lays a little bit of secondary blame on Trump, writing:\n\nRace, gender, age will determine Kamala Harris' running mate\n\nAs Kamala Harris steps up to take on Donald Trump in the 2024 Presidential Election, political realities will determine who her running mate will be.\n\nGrant's argument amounts to a claim that since Obama didn't solve inequality, particularly race inequality, it was only natural that Trump would exploit racism to win the 2016 Election.\n\nGrant implies that solving inequality - supposedly doable within two four-year terms - is the Democrats' job and if they don't do that successfully, voters will naturally turn to the Republicans. These are the same Republicans who we all know have no intention of doing anything about inequality, but indeed are hellbent on making it worse.\n\nAs facts would have it, the American Council of Economic Advisors found in 2016 that the Obama Presidency carried out the 'most aggressive and successful attempt to reduce inequality in half a century'. On the other hand, just like the Right always does, Trump's Administration worked hard to increase inequality.\n\nWhether he meant to or not, Grant did get close to describing the real reason Trump's MAGA movement grew out of Trump's racist, misogynistic promise to take America back to the past. Grant quotes political scientist George Friedman in saying White working-class voters rejected the Democratic \"elite\" because this elite attacked their churches' authoritative views as racist, sexist or homophobic.\n\nThis claim almost gets to the real reason why people support Trump, but misses a key point. The MAGA movement is not a backlash against \"elites\". At the heart of Trump's support is a backlash against those who fight for equality.\n\nThis includes some elites, but also, crucially, the victims of inequality themselves who unite in the movements against racism, sexism and homophobia, alongside struggles by the Left - including the union movement - to reduce income and wealth inequality.\n\nMedia has normalised Trump's bullying - it's time to take control\n\nPresidential candidate Donald Trump has become notorious for his aggression and bullying, which the mainstream media is happy to ignore.\n\nThe vast majority of people in these movements, by the way, are suffering all the ills of inequality that Leigh Sales claims led to voters supporting Trump. What is the difference between them? Democrats fight for equality and Republicans fight against it. The fact is, MAGA is not just a political coalition premised on bigotry and hate, it is a sometimes-violent pushback against those who fight for a more equal society.\n\nGrant might be right that the Obama Presidency influenced the rise of Trump, but he is offensively wrong about the reasons why. The true reason the MAGA base turned against Obama (if indeed any of them voted Democrat to start with) was because Obama was the symbolic face of American equality. MAGA voters could not fathom living in a society where a Black person could become President.\n\nTrump's promise to \"Make America Great Again\" has always been an unspoken but constantly implied promise to make America more unequal again.\n\nJust as Trump used Obama's race against him in his pro-inequality movement, he has already shown he plans to do the same to Vice President Kamala Harris. Harris symbolises race and gender equality. The MAGA movement could not accept a Black president and so it certainly can't accept a mixed-race, Black woman as leader.\n\nDr Victoria Fielding is an Independent Australia columnist.

Sarasota Police Department officials say about 500 residents were rescued from flooded homes. Record-setting rain was next expected to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina.

Seventeen other people have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting.

The Japanese index fell back after its biggest early advance, gaining 8.7% by midmorning. On Monday, nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as world markets quaked under fears the U.S. economy is slowing too much. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%.

Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election.

After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election.

They include Lebanon's Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels of Yemen, Shiite militias in Iraq and others. Those relationships are managed by Iran's powerful paramilitary organization, the Revolutionary Guard. Iran relies on those proxy forces as international sanctions on Tehran, including over its nuclear program, have kept it from receiving advanced weaponry. While developing its own missile program, Iran also relies on militias as an asymmetric threat to squeeze Israel and the United States.\n\nBangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina resigns as widening unrest sees protesters storm her official residence\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh's prime minister has resigned and fled the country, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule.

Bailey said in a statement that New York's \"illicit prosecution\" has undermined the Republican candidate's ability to run for president.\n\nBailey filed the suit in July, arguing that the state of New York violated \"Missourians' First Amendment right to hear from a presidential candidate in the 2024 presidential election.\"\n\nThe lawsuit adds that the state's \"overt meddling in a presidential election sabotages Missourians' ability to hear from and cast a fully-informed vote for president mere months before the election.\"","Google's parent company Alphabet Inc. has attributed failures in its search engine results about former President Donald Trump and the recent attempt on his life to unspecified \"bugs\" and the search engine's algorithm, according to Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio).\n\nGoogle users searching for information about the former president last week reported their queries returned news stories about Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump's name was also noticeably absent from Google's list of suggested queries when users searched for it or about the July 13 assassination attempt against Trump.\n\nJordan, as head of the House Judiciary Committee and its Weaponization of the Federal Government panel, is investigating whether those anomalies were in error or part of a deliberate attempt to influence the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\"Through counsel, Alphabet admitted to the Committee and Select Subcommittee that, after the July 13 assassination attempt on President Trump, 'predictions for queries about the assassination attempt against former President Trump' 'should have appeared but didn't,'\" Jordan wrote.\n\nAccording to the congressman, Google attorney Daniel Donovan attributed the issue to Google Search's \"out of date\" protections around political violence that were built into its autocomplete feature. Donovan also reportedly advised that the problem had been resolved.\n\nThe attorney similarly blamed the omission of Trump's name from Google's suggested searches list on \"a bug\" that was later fixed in an update.\n\nAs for why searches for Trump's name returned news stories about the vice president instead, Donovan reportedly attributed the problem to the search engine's algorithm, which automatically displays news stories related to inquiries.\n\n\"The company also noted that 'predictions ... may be unexpected or imperfect, and bugs will occur,'\" Jordan said of Alphabet's response.\n\nUnsatisfied with Google's explanations, Jordan provided the attorney with a list of questions that committee members will expect him to answer at a briefing later this week.\n\nPrimarily, the committee wants to know when Google first learned of the referenced search problems, how long they occurred, how long it took to correct them, and their overall impacts on Americans' ability to obtain information about the Republican nominee for president.\n\nThe letter did not reveal the date of the briefing.\n\nThe suggested terms included \"president donald duck\" and \"president donald regan\" alongside a picture of President Ronald Reagan.\n\nTrump's name was not on the list.\n\n\"Wow, Google has a search ban on President Donald Trump! Election interference?\" Musk wrote.\n\nGoogle is not the only tech company to have faced such allegations in recent weeks.\n\nIn a July 30 statement, Meta acknowledged the fact-check label as \"a mistake\" prompted by the circulation of a different, doctored photo in which the Secret Service agents surrounding Trump reportedly appeared to be smiling.\n\nMeanwhile, the company revealed that the chatbot issue was a deliberate move on the part of programmers to prevent the spread of inaccurate information.\n\n\"Rather than have Meta AI give incorrect information about the attempted assassination, we programmed it to simply not answer questions about it after it happened -- and instead give a generic response about how it couldn't provide any information. This is why some people reported our AI was refusing to talk about the event,\" the company said.\n\nWhile the chatbot's responses have since been updated, Meta acknowledged that its programmers \"should have done this sooner.\"\n\n\"We're committed to ensuring our platforms are a place where people can freely express themselves, and we are always working to make improvements,\" the company said.\n\nIn a July 30 Truth Social post that has since been deleted, Trump urged his supporters to \"go after\" Meta and Google for what he described as \"another attempt at rigging the election.\"","Washington -- The Supreme Court on Monday rejected an attempt by the state of Missouri to stay former President Donald Trump's impending sentencing and lift a gag order imposed in the New York \"silence\" case until after the November presidential election.\n\nThe Supreme Court denied Missouri's request to file suit against New York and rejected a separate motion to stay Trump's conviction in an unsigned order. There were no dissents. Justices Clarence and Samuel Alito said they would have granted the state's request to file suit but would not have granted the other relief Missouri sought.\n\nIn May, a New York jury convicted Trump on 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal a $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election.\n\nHe has vowed to appeal his conviction, and his sentencing, originally scheduled for July 11, has been postponed until September 18. The New York judge overseeing the case, Judge Juan Merchan, lifted part of the gag order in June, but Trump is still not allowed to speak about prosecutors, court staff and their families.\n\nMerchan must also decide by Sept. 6 whether to overturn Trump's conviction based on the Supreme Court's ruling that he is entitled to immunity from federal prosecution for official acts performed while in the White House. Trump's lawyers have argued that under the court's ruling, prosecutors should not have been allowed to present evidence at trial of the former president's official acts. Manhattan prosecutors disagree with their assertions.\n\nIn his request to stay Trump's sentence and temporarily lift the gag order, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican, claimed that New York prosecutors were trying to interfere with Trump's campaign by using their \"coercive power\" in the form of the gag order and the upcoming sentence.\n\n\"Allowing New York State to continue its actions during this election period infringes on voters' rights and sets a dangerous precedent that any of the thousands of elected prosecutors in other states could follow in the future,\" he wrote. \"The public interest is firmly on the side of Missouri and protecting the electoral process from this type of partisan interference.\"\n\nBailey told the court that New York interfered with Missouri's electoral process by preventing electors and voters from seeing Trump during the campaign and hearing him speak. Even if Trump could schedule events in September and October, after his scheduled sentencing, the gag order would limit what he could say at those rallies, Bailey argued.\n\n\"The fact that Trump is being unfairly targeted by his general election opponent and his allies is of course very relevant to Trump's narrative about which candidate voters should support in November,\" he said.\n\nBailey said that while a criminal conviction or a publication ban would generally not interfere with voters' choice to elect their preferred candidate when he has no chance of winning, Trump is the Republican nominee for president and is leading in some states. He also said that Trump was not convicted of committing a violent crime, but rather of \"mere accounting violations.\"\n\n\"There is no urgency to impose an immediate sentence and a gag order,\" the Republican attorney general wrote. \"What is urgent is that the American people hear from the major candidates without a state interfering with a candidate's campaign.\"\n\nNew York officials have urged the Supreme Court to reject Missouri's attempt to suspend Trump's sentence, arguing that the state is trying to advance Trump's individual interests and that the nation's highest court has no role to play.\n\n\"Allowing Missouri to bring this lawsuit against New York would permit an extraordinary and dangerous maneuver to circumvent former President Trump's ongoing legal proceedings and the statutory limitations on this Court's jurisdiction to review state court decisions,\" Attorney General Letitia James wrote in a filing.\n\nJames, a Democrat, argued that the actions challenged by Missouri are not the fault of New York state, but rather of the Manhattan district attorney, who is elected by county voters.\n\n\"Allowing Missouri to invoke this court's jurisdiction to interfere with the enforcement of criminal law in New York is contrary to these fundamental principles and undermines New York's proud tradition of preserving the independence of local prosecutors,\" she wrote.\n\nJames also warned that Missouri's request for relief risks undermining the integrity of the courts and opening the way to a flood of similar litigation, which she called \"meritless.\"\n\nMissouri's push for relief that would benefit Trump is one of several attempts by Republicans to influence the criminal proceedings. Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York filed a misconduct complaint against Merchan with the state court system in May. The House Judiciary Committee, led by Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, has also been investigating the Manhattan prosecution of Trump.\n\nFour Republican-led states have backed Missouri's bid to the Supreme Court, calling the allegation \"serious\" that New York is using its criminal process to interfere with the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\"Missouri argues that this court should step in to delay these politically motivated lawsuits until after the election in order to thwart their apparent goal of interfering with the vote,\" Republican officials from Florida, Iowa, Alaska and Montana said in a filing. \"That is a serious claim, and this court has a constitutional and statutory obligation to resolve it.\"\n\nMore from Melissa Quinn\n\nMelissa Quinn is a political reporter for CBSNews.com.

This information comes from a recent foreign agent disclosure filing.\n\nWhat Happened: Conway registered last Friday to represent Pinchuk's foundation. The filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act reveals that Conway will liaise with U.S. lawmakers and experts on Ukraine's interests and raise awareness about \"Ukrainians' fight for freedom and the Russian illegal war of aggression,\" reported The Hill.\n\nConway is also expected to encourage U.S. lawmakers to attend the Yalta European Strategy annual meeting in Kyiv on Sept. 13-14. She will represent the U.K. office of the Victor Pinchuk Foundation, a private, nonpartisan, philanthropic company focused on advancing various causes in Ukraine.\n\nSee Also: Anthony Scaramucci Says Trump Could Drop His Presidential Bid Against Kamala Harris If This Happens: 'I Know How This Man Thinks'\n\nThe filing also reveals that Pinchuk \"owns and controls\" the foundation, which is not owned or controlled by the Ukrainian government. However, the Ukrainian government is the \"principal beneficiary of the registrant's activities directed by the foreign principal.\"\n\nConway's agreement with the foundation includes a monthly fee of $50,000, with the term of the agreement running from July 25 to Nov. 14.\n\nThis move comes amidst hesitation from many Republicans to approve more aid to Ukraine. Conway's former boss, Trump, has previously suggested that additional aid to Ukraine could come as a loan and claimed he could end the war in 24 hours if he were in the White House.\n\nWhy It Matters: Conway is known for coining the phrase \"Alternative Facts\" during a Meet The Press interview in January 2017 when she defended White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer's false narrative about Trump's inauguration attendance figures.\n\nMore recently in 2022, she criticized Pennsylvania Democratic Senate nominee John Fetterman (D-Pa.) for his support of cannabis legalization.\n\nIn August 2023, she speculated that President Joe Biden might not participate in any debates in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election. However, the president did end up debating Trump but his disappointing performance led to his ultimate exit from the race.\n\nPhoto Courtesy: Evan El-Amin on Shutterstock.com\n\nCheck This Out:\n\nLawmakers Made Huge Investments This Year.

He also wanted to shorten his supervised release from three years to 12 months. Prosecutors opposed returning the items, citing them as evidence. However, they mentioned that if the items were returned, Chansley would need to assure the court that he would not challenge his criminal conviction further.\n\nIn a 6-page order on Monday, Senior U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth wrote:\n\nOn January 6, 2021, defendant Jacob Anthony Chansley joined the Capitol breach like many others but gained global attention due to his unique attire, which included a horned headdress, face paint, gloves, and a weapon in the form of a six-foot pole with an American flag and metal spearhead.\n\nMr. Chansley has completed his prison sentence and much of his term of supervised release. Now, he has moved for the return of his property seized and still held by the government, including his spear and helmet. Since the government has not established that it still needs these items as evidence and has not sought their forfeiture, the Court will GRANT Mr. Chansley's motion.\n\nChansley was sentenced in November 2021 to 41 months in prison and 36 months supervised release. Originally facing six charges, he struck a plea deal and pleaded guilty to only one count: obstruction of an official proceeding, a charge recently narrowed by the U.S. Supreme Court in Fischer v. United States.\n\nAll told, Chansley was incarcerated for 11 months before being released to a halfway house in March 2023 so he could start his supervised release program. When he tried to end that early, prosecutors reminded Lamberth that though the judge was effusive with his praise of Chansley at sentencing -- he had called Chansley's mea culpa \"the most remarkable I've heard in 34 years\" and \"akin to the kind of thing Martin Luther King would have said\" -- it was just two years after that when the judge expressed a certain degree of buyer's remorse.\n\nLamberth had learned that Chansley gave interviews to the press that were a far cry from contrite; the defendant said that he regretted pleading guilty.\n\nLamberth acknowledged this in his Monday order as well as Chansley's subsequent appeal. That appeal didn't go far because Chansley withdrew it. But he then he moved to vacate his sentence, claiming he had new evidence to vindicate himself and further, that he had \"ineffective assistance of his plea counsel.\"\n\nThat motion was denied and the judge reminded Chansley of that fact on Monday -- as well as his prior \"disappointment that 'Mr. Chansley has recanted the contrition displayed at his sentencing.\"\"\n\nIn a footnote of the order, Lamberth notably included a snippet of Chansley's statement from sentencing that had so moved the judge and came back to bite him later:\n\nSo I had to come to terms with the fact that I was in solitary confinement because of me, because of my decision. I broke the law, and if I believe in freedom, if I believe in law and order, if I believe in responsibility and accountability, then that means that I should do what Gandhi would do and take responsibility even and especially when it incriminates me,\" Chansley said at sentencing. \"No ifs, ands, or buts about it. That's what men of honor do. I am truly, truly repentant for my actions, because repentance is not just saying you're sorry. Repentance is apologizing and then moving in the exact opposite direction of the sin that you committed. And that's what I've been trying to do ever since I realized the magnitude of my error and the magnitude of my mistake. [I]n retrospect, I would do everything differently on January 6. In all honesty, I would do everything differently.\n\nThough the \"QAnon Shaman\" will have his iconic spear and fur-lined helmet back, Lamberth was silent on Chansley's July request for an early release from supervised probation.\n\nInstead, the judge said only that the government had failed to establish why Chansley's property was \"evidence\" at this stage and that it was not clear to him \"how Mr. Chansley could contest his conviction, as he has been sentenced, abandoned his direct appeal, and seen his § 2255 motion denied.\"\n\n\"But even if the government may need to reprove Mr. Chansley's guilt, the government has not explained why it would need his property,\" Lamberth wrote, adding that it was not enough for prosecutors to suggest the government may \"eventually\" seek civil forfeiture.\n\nWhile Chansley was the \"face of the riot,\" the judge wrote, and \"images of him at the Capitol on that day abound,\" three years have passed and prosecutors have \"never sought forfeiture of the property involved in the Capitol siege.\"\n\n\"As there is voluminous video and photo evidence of Mr. Chansley's conduct, his property is of little utility for an investigation or prosecution and 'the United States' legitimate interests can be satisfied even if the property is returned ... The Court therefore finds that the retention of Mr. Chansley's property would be unreasonable,\" the judge wrote.\n\n\"But when the government has vast amounts of other evidence, it cannot defeat a Rule 41(g) motion simply by asserting its desire to retain the evidence without giving any reasons,\" the judge wrote.","The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a lawsuit filed by Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey seeking to lift a gag order and delay Donald Trump's sentencing on multiple convictions in his New York City hush money trial. Bailey said in a statement that New York's \"illicit prosecution\" has undermined the Republican candidate's ability to run for president.\n\nBailey filed the suit in July, arguing that the state of New York violated \"Missourians' First Amendment right to hear from a presidential candidate in the 2024 presidential election.\"\n\nThe lawsuit adds that the state's \"overt meddling in a presidential election sabotages Missourians' ability to hear from and cast a fully-informed vote for president mere months before the election.\"","People celebrate the resignation of Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in Dhaka, Bangladesh, August 5, 2024.

It's a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google. It's the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. Mehta reviewed reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial. He issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\nDow drops 1,000 points, and Japanese stocks suffer worst crash since 1987 as markets quake worldwide\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly everything on Wall Street tumbled as fear about a slowing U.S. economy worsened and set off another sell-off for financial markets around the world. The S&P 500 sank 3% Monday for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4%. That followed a 12.4% plunge for Japan's Nikkei 225, its worst since 1987. Treasury yields pared their losses after a report showed U.S. services businesses are continuing to grow. But worries are still high after Friday's report showing U.S. employers pulled back on hiring last month by more than expected.\n\nTropical Storm Debby hits Florida with floods, threat of record rain in Georgia and the Carolinas\n\nHORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with torrential rain, high winds and flooding, contributing to at least five deaths as it turned menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatened to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities. Record-setting rain was expected to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Historic cities including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, are gearing up for potential high water. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It is now a tropical storm, with top wind speeds around 50 mph.\n\nEx-Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be dropped\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's campaign Jenna Ellis will cooperate with Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in a fake electors case. The state attorney general's office announced the agreement Monday. Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges. Ellis was charged in Georgia last year after she appeared with Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers. False allegations of election fraud were made at that meeting. She pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements and writings.\n\nVenezuela's top prosecutor announces criminal probe against opposition leaders González, Machado\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor has announced a criminal investigation against the opposition's presidential candidate Edmundo González and its leader Maria Corina Machado over their call on the armed forces to abandon their support for President Nicolás Maduro and to stop repressing demonstrators. Attorney General Tarek William Saab's statement tied the investigation directly to a written appeal the two members of the opposition sent hours earlier about Maduro and the demonstrators who have come out in force to defend their votes in the July 28 election. Saab said the duo \"falsely announced a winner of the presidential election other than the one proclaimed by the National Electoral Council\" and they openly incited \"police and military officials to disobey the laws.\"\n\nRally dates are set. Venues are chosen. The only thing missing for Harris' blitz is her VP choice\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The dates are set. The venues are chosen. The only thing missing from this week's campaign blitz with Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate is the name of that running mate. After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris is set to decide as early as Monday on her choice before the two set off on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the states of the election. That means there's not much time left for advocates for and against different picks to get in their final licks.\n\nKamala Harris is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' coronation as the Democrats' standard-bearer for the 2024 presidential election is soon becoming official. That will happen Monday night when her party announces the results of online voting by delegates. It will cap a tumultuous period for the party prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance and his subsequent withdrawal from the race. Harris is the daughter of immigrants who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to become the first female vice president in U.S. history. She is clinching the nomination more than four years after her first attempt at the presidency collapsed.\n\nIn Israel and Lebanon, life goes on even as the region teeters on the edge of all-out war\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- In Beirut, shops are open and traffic is as snarled as ever. In Tel Aviv, cafes hum with patrons and umbrellas sprout across crowded beaches.
