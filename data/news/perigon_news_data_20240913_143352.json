The most recent polls show that the incumbent president is vulnerable with an approval rate hovering around 40%, and Americans don't have any enthusiasm for a revival of the 2020 duel between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Joe Biden’s chances seem to depend on some key issues like the state of the economy, the impact of his balance sheet, his age and his ability to force the ballot box issue in November 2024. The ongoing debate in Congress over the debt ceiling does nothing to build confidence, and many observers note that Joe Biden has significant economic, environmental and social successes under his belt. Despite this, the highly polarized political climate is not helping to publicize the benefits of the Biden administration. In 2024, Joe Biden will have to articulate his vision and order to make it to make the ballot ballot box.","translation":"","translatedTitle":null,"translatedDescription":null,"translatedSummary":null,"locations":[],"reprint":false,"reprintGroupId":"1a83b03ef9f44366b2ffe12c4e7abc16","places":[],"people":[]},"1.3":{"url":"https://bringmethenews.com/mn-elections-2024/mn-presidential-election-2024","authorsByline":"","articleId":"8e7229da6df844faa715c1be32392ff0","clusterId":"b9a6f9c859274d47ba1961d723fd8afc","source":{"domain":"bringmethenews.com","location":{"country":null,"state":null,"county":null,"city":null},"paywall":null},"imageUrl":"","country":"us","language":"en","pubDate":"2024-01-16T19:49:45+00:00","addDate":"2024-01-16T20:08:09.968947+00:00","refreshDate":"2024-01-16T20:08:09.968948+00:00","score":119.7505,"title":"Presidential election 2024","description":"Presidential election 2024","content":"You Can Get BMTN Special Offers!","medium":"Article","links":[],"labels":[],"matchedAuthors":[],"claim":"","verdict":"","keywords":[],"topics":[],"categories":[],"entities":[],"companies":[],"sentiment":{"positive":0.5452,"negative":0.033,"neutral":0.4217},"summary":"","translation":"","translatedTitle":"","translatedDescription":"","translatedSummary":"","locations":[],"reprint":false,"reprintGroupId":"4f02674d4c9341539b8d352353db94da","places":[],"people":[]},"2.3":{"url":"https://worldtimetodays.com/presidential-election-2024-first-lady-jill-biden-travels-to-north-carolina-to-talk-about-womens-health/","authorsByline":"Laura Coffey","articleId":"b5ad098cd1084c579d574ccae0b7801a","clusterId":"60a3e13c3e784116b52f6e4fec975969","source":{"domain":"worldtimetodays.com","location":{"country":null,"state":null,"county":null,"city":null},"paywall":null},"imageUrl":"https://worldtimetodays.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/14548636_032024-wtvd-jill-biden-visit-vid.jpg","country":"us","language":"en","pubDate":"2024-03-20T12:58:04+00:00","addDate":"2024-03-20T13:07:56.538483+00:00","refreshDate":"2024-03-20T13:07:56.538484+00:00","score":119.7505,"title":"Presidential election 2024","description":"Wednesday, March 20, 2024, 12:10 p.m","content":"First Lady Jill Biden is traveling to North Carolina as part of the White House Women’s Health Research Initiative.\n\nDURHAM, North Carolina – First Lady Jill Biden is traveling to North Carolina today...

A poll indicates that with Harris at the top of the ticket, Georgia is once again a tossup in the presidential election against Republican Donald Trump.
