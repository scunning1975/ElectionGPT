In the video, the 60-year-old Minnesota Governor is seen sitting in his living room wearing a quintessentially Midwest outfit: a black t-shirt, khakis, white sneakers, and a camo hat. Walz's outfit quickly garnered attention -- especially from Chappell Roan fans who joked about the similarity between the singer's viral Midwest Princess hat and Walz's.\n\nSoon after, the Harris and Walz campaign released its camo hat which looks almost identical to the Midwest Princess lid. Even Roan herself commented on the now-viral hat, tweeting \"is this real\" in response to another tweet about the hat.\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign hasn't officially confirmed whether the hat is a reference to Roan, but they do already have a track record of embracing artists' iconography. A couple of weeks ago, after Charlie XCX tweeted \"kamala IS brat,\" the VP's official Twitter page changed its background image to a Brat-green one. Needless to say, fans of Harris and Charlie quickly spun up Brat-themed Harris merch that you can also find on sites like Etsy.\n\nIf you're hoping for a Harris-Walz win in November, pick up a Roan-inspired camo hat on Etsy here."],"source":{"uri":["rollingstone.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Rolling Stone"]},"authors":[{"uri":["oscar_hartzog@rollingstone.com"],"name":["Oscar Hartzog"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Gray_5.jpg?w=900&h=600&crop=1"],"eventUri":["eng-9798191"],"sentiment":[0.1843],"wgt":[460763742],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8264247795"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["21:54:06"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T21:54:06Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T21:49:10Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/JUSHI-HOLDINGS-INC-120797496/news/Jushi-Financial-Statements-Q2-2024-47588355/"],"title":["Jushi :  Financial Statements Q2 2024"],"body":["CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this \"report\") may contain \"forward-looking statements\" and \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including Canadian securities legislation and United States (\"U.S.\") securities legislation (collectively, \"forward-looking information\") which are based upon the Company's current internal expectations, estimates, projections, assumptions and beliefs.

Tim Walz, announced this week as U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate for the 2024 presidential election -- wasn't at Farmfest this year. But he had a former U.S. senator and his lieutenant governor stumping for him and defending his record in farm country.\n\nThe Harris campaign highlighted the agricultural record of Walz in the press release announcing his selection.\n\n\"He became a member of Congress in a Republican district by representing the needs of farmers and rural America,\" said the campaign.\n\nIn southwest Minnesota, which is far from blue territory in the state, Walz got support from former U.S. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat from North Dakota, who was at Farmfest on Aug. 7 on behalf of the Harris-Walz ticket.\n\nHeitkamp met Walz during her first couple weeks in Congress.\n\n\"I got to meet him traveling back and forth on the plane from D.C. to the Twin Cities, and I tell people my first impression was that I've known him all my life,\" Heitkamp said. \"He's like everybody else that I grew up with. Every social studies teacher, every person who makes communities work.\"\n\nWalz, a U.S. House member for 12 years before becoming Minnesota's governor, has a history of supporting farmers, Heitkamp said. She called him \"instrumental\" in passing \"one of the most successful farm bills.\"\n\nDuring his last term in Congress, Walz sponsored legislation to expand veterans' access to farm programs.\n\n\"We've been building on that ever since,\" Heitkamp said of the current farm bill which includes extended provisions from Walz's veterans bill.\n\nHeitkamp said she believes that Walz, who grew up on his family's farm in Nebraska, will give rural America \"a seat at the table\" if elected as vice president.\n\n\"Where we are headed in agriculture going into the future, we can't just rest on our laurels and assume that we can keep doing the same thing that we've always done. I think we need dynamic leadership that understands that you just don't throw money at a problem,\" Heitkamp said.\n\nMinnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan filled in for Walz during his slotted speech time at Farmfest, as he attended a campaign rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\n\"I think during our last five years, we've been incredible partners with agriculture,\" Flanagan said.\n\nShe pointed to hiring farmer and former Minnesota Farmers Union lobbyist Thom Petersen as Minnesota's ag commissioner as \"one of the most powerful things\" done by Walz's administration.\n\n\"The investments that we have made in ensuring that we have low-interest loans for farmers, our work around emerging farmers has been important, and the investments in AGRI (value-added grants) and dairy,\" she said of some of the accomplishments led by Walz.\n\nShe said the Walz administration has been able to respond and partner with farmers as the state has navigated through multiple droughts and now flooding.\n\n\"The best thing, I think, that we can point to is how we listen to the agriculture community, and then we see that translated into policy. That's how we've been leading,\" Flanagan said. \"I think people can expect that from him in the future.\""],"source":{"uri":["inforum.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["INFORUM"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/b1d678c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5736x3812+0+0/resize/1604x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F52%2F13%2F463b84bb4373bb6ecfa849907e58%2Fflanagan.JPG"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.098],"wgt":[460763211],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8264239223"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["21:39:53"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T21:39:53Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T21:39:25Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://radaronline.com/p/taylor-swift-pic-sparks-kamala-harris-endorsement-rumor/"],"title":["Did Taylor Swift Just Endorse Kamala Harris for President on Instagram?

As the Democratic nominee for the 2024 presidential election, Harris's new stance reflects the growing role of digital assets in the political landscape.\n\nThis comes as former President Donald Trump continues to support the crypto sector.\n\nRussell Starr, head of capital markets at DeFi Technologies and an upcoming speaker at Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets event, provided valuable insights on Harris's new approach. Starr believes Harris's involvement with cryptocurrency highlights its rising importance and her effort to connect with this rapidly expanding industry.\n\nAlso Read: Kamala Harris's Election Odds Just Hit A Peak Of 48%, According To Crypto Bettors -- Is It The Walz Effect?\n\nClear Regulations and Industry Cooperation\n\nStarr pointed out that Harris's focus on clear regulations could benefit the crypto industry by providing straightforward guidelines. \"By providing this clarity, the U.S. can attract more investment and innovation in the crypto space, making it a global leader in digital assets,\" Starr noted.\n\nHarris's outreach to crypto leaders and stakeholders could also ensure that policies are informed by practical knowledge. Starr stated, \"This kind of engagement fosters collaboration and helps bridge the gap between policymakers and industry innovators, potentially leading to more effective and practical regulations.\"\n\nAdvancing Financial Inclusion\n\nIntegrating cryptocurrencies into the traditional financial system could also promote financial inclusion, helping those underserved by banks. Starr highlighted that this approach supports the development of new technologies, making financial services more accessible.\n\nHowever, Starr cautioned that for Harris's engagement to be effective, it's essential that policies involve input from diverse stakeholders within the crypto community. Balancing progress with regulation requires a comprehensive understanding of the industry's unique challenges and opportunities. He also stressed the importance of keeping the approach nonpartisan to avoid alienating groups.\n\nWant To Learn More\n\nAs Harris's stance on digital currencies develops, Starr believes her involvement shows a recognition of the sector's growing influence and the need for thoughtful policies.\n\nHe concluded, \"By fostering a supportive regulatory environment and encouraging open dialogue, Harris can help pave the way for a more inclusive, innovative, and sustainable future for cryptocurrencies.\"\n\nThe upcoming Benzinga Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19 in NYC will provide a platform for further discussion and networking among digital asset companies and institutional investors. This event will feature over 1,000 capital markets leaders and offer numerous opportunities for engagement and collaboration, reflecting the growing interest and adoption of digital assets.\n\nRead Next: Donald Trump Jr. And Eric Trump Tease DeFi Project With 'BeDeFiant' Hashtag\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\nMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs"],"source":{"uri":["benzinga.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Benzinga"]},"authors":[{"uri":["abbey_higginbotham@benzinga.com"],"name":["Abbey Higginbotham"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2024/08/07/kamala-harris.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&fit=crop"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.498],"wgt":[460762233],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8264230301"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["21:29:42"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T21:29:42Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T21:29:01Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.patheos.com/blogs/ecopreacher/2024/08/walzs-mind-your-own-damn-business-is-actually-biblical/"],"title":["Walz's \"Mind Your Own Damn Business\" is Actually Biblical"],"body":["\"Mind your own damn business,\" said Democratic VP candidate Tim Walz to Republicans. What he said was surprisingly biblical.\n\nWhen Minnesota Governor Tim Walz was announced as Kamala Harris's running mate in the 2024 presidential election, many of my Lutheran family, friends, and colleagues celebrated that he was Lutheran as well. Walz counts himself as a \"Minnesota Lutheran dad,\" and his church, Pilgrim Lutheran in St. Paul, is part of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the denomination in which I'm ordained.\n\nThe Lutherans in Minnesota are mostly descended from Scandinavian immigrants who settled the area in the 1800s, though Walz's parents are Roman Catholic. Walz hasn't talked at length (yet) about how his faith inform his stance on political issues. However, his support for affordable health care, education funding, social justice and equality, clean air and water, advocacy for the LGBTQIA+ community, and providing free lunch to all school children certainly reflect Jesus's teachings to care for one's neighbors, protect the vulnerable, and feed those in need.\n\nIn part of his speech, he said this:\n\nSome of us are old enough to remember when it was Republicans who were talking about freedom. It turns out now what they meant was that the government should be free to invade your doctor's office. In Minnesota we respect our neighbors and the personal choices that they make. Even if we wouldn't make the same choice for ourselves, there's a golden rule: Mind your own damn business!\n\nIn other words, Walz believes the government should not be dictating how one expresses their gender, who they love, what they read, what health care they can receive, or what religion they practice.\n\nThis contrasts with the christofascist architects of Project 2025 who want to implement their 900 pages worth of authoritarian thought-control and twisted, controlling morality on U.S. citizens through a second Trump administration.\n\nWhile \"Mind your own damn business\" elicited raucous applause from the crowd, it also struck me that this phrase is surprisingly biblical. Both the Hebrew Scriptures and the New Testament contain teachings and instructions about not meddling in people's personal affairs. These passages are applicable both to individuals and to lawmakers. Let's dig in.\n\nExodus 20:1-7 and Deut 5:4-21\n\nThis one may shock you. Aren't the Ten Commandments all about dictating behavior? Well, yes and no. What they do is help us determine what's acceptable and what's not when it comes to how our personal actions impact others.\n\nIf you love God, you won't worship human-made idols or use God's name for blasphemy - both of which center human power and use religion to justify this power. Also, if you love God, you'll allow yourself and others a day of rest. You'll honor your parents and others in society. If you love God, you won't murder, harm your life partner, steal, lie, or scheme to take what others have.\n\nIn other words, mind your own damn business. If your business harms others, then we need to intervene. If not, the government should not be legislating the behaviors of others because it's none of their damn business.\n\nProverbs 25:17\n\nLet your foot be seldom in your neighbor's house,\n\notherwise the neighbor will become weary of you and hate you.\n\nProverbs is a collection of pithy aphorisms and advice that are as much about one's faith as about how to live together in community. Proverbs 25:17 cautions against being overly intrusive in people's lives and respecting others' boundaries. This goes for individuals, but it also applies to the government which need not set foot in citizens' personal lives unless there is something criminal or harmful going on.\n\nProverbs 26:17\n\nLike one who grabs a stray dog by the ears is someone who rushes into a quarrel not their own.\n\nAgain, this works not just for individuals with a predilection of involving themselves in disputes that do not concern them, but for government interference in people's lives. There is no need for busybodies or for the state to meddle in other people's affairs.\n\nSo, stop grabbing the ears of the dog! Mind your own damn business!\n\nPaul wrote to the church in Thessalonica: \"Aspire to live quietly, to mind your own affairs, and to work with your hands, as we directed you, so that you may behave properly towards outsiders and be dependent on no one.\"\n\nDid you catch that? Paul literally told folks: mind your own damn business! When self-righteous Christians try to dictate what you can and cannot do, whip out this verse to remind them to focus on their own lives and work. They don't need to involve themselves in the affairs of others. Respect yourself and respect others. Seriously, it's not that hard.\n\n\"But let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, a criminal, or even as a mischief-maker.\"\n\nWow, Jesus's right-hand man, Peter, put \"mischief-makers\" (i.e., meddlers) on par with murderers, thieves, and criminals!\n\nWhy so harsh? Because being a thought-policing sanctimonious busy-body stirs up trouble for people who are just minding their own business. For example, if a person want to dress in drag, or marry someone you don't approve of, or read books to their kids that you don't like, what business is that of yours? Stop targeting them. Because that can, in fact, lead to a mob mentality and, ultimately, murder and crime against innocent people.\n\nWhy do you pass judgment on your sibling? Or you, why do you despise them? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God. For it is written,\n\n'As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me,\n\nand every tongue shall give praise to God.'\n\nSo then, each of us will be accountable to God.\n\nLet us therefore no longer pass judgment on one another, but resolve instead never to put a stumbling-block or hindrance in the way of another.\n\nThis is another passage that helps us distinguish what's acceptable to pass judgment on and what's not. Paul's letter to the Romans tells us that if someone's behavior is a \"stumbling block\" or \"hindrance\" that harms others, then we need to pay attention to that. If it's not, then leave them alone.\n\nAs Tim Walz said in his speech, respect your neighbors and the personal choices that they make. Just because you wouldn't make that choice for yourself does not mean you should pass judgment on them and hate on them and get everyone else in your circle to gang up on them.\n\nFor example, if a woman decides with her doctor to terminate her pregnancy, or if she decides to use IVF to become pregnant, that is her decision. Not yours, not the government's. Mind your own damn business!\n\nAnd finally a word about minding your own business from Jesus himself:\n\n\"Why do you see the speck in your neighbor's eye, but do not notice the log in your own eye? Or how can you say to your neighbor, \"Let me take the speck out of your eye\", while the log is in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your neighbor's eye.\"\n\nThis is Jesus literally saying to the crowds gathered on the mountain, mind your own damn business! Stop passing judgment on people. You don't know what they're going through. You don't know what challenges they are facing. It feels awful when people do that to you, so don't do it to others.\n\nWhen you point out the insignificant things about people to draw attention to them in a negative way and make them feel ashamed about who they are and what and who they love - while expecting people to ignore your obvious faults - you are a hypocrite. It's petty, it's juvenile, and it sullies your own integrity. So just stop.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have targeted people who are trans, gender-fluid, gay, lesbian, bisexual, and anything other than cisgender heteronormative for decades. It's especially heinous that they are picking on children by passing laws against gender-affirming care in some states and banning books with LGBTQIA stories and characters.\n\nKeep in mind that in Jesus's time, they did not have the modern parlance about gender that we do today. But he says something very interesting about eunuchs in the Gospel of Matthew:\n\n'Not everyone can accept this teaching, but only those to whom it is given. For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept this who can.' Matthew 19:11-12\n\nEunuchs were castrated men placed in charge over a king's harem of wives and concubines. But what Jesus is saying here is that some people are a certain gender because of their physical conditions or their inclinations from birth. Others are made eunuchs not by their own choice but by force. Still others choose to express their gender \"for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.\" In other words, it is to the glory of God that they are who they are.\n\nThus, gender and gender expression are personal matters that should in no way be legislated by the state or judged by others.\n\nJesus concludes by saying, \"The one who can accept this should accept it.\" What I hear him saying without words is: the rest of you can mind your own damn business!\n\nStated in a more positive way, Walz's words and these biblical passages are about living a life guided by practical, common-sense wisdom, respecting others, and allowing people to live without unnecessary conflict and interference.\n\nWhen we focus on our own responsibilities and practice humility and self-reflection, we encourage others to do the same. It's about personal integrity, freedom from harassment, and freedom to pursue joy.\n\nAnd all of this is, indeed, biblical.\n\n3 New Testament Messages for Resisting Autocracy\n\n3 Old Testament Passages about the Tyranny of Kings\n\nPreaching 2024 Election - How will Clergy Navigate Issues?"],"source":{"uri":["patheos.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Patheos - Seek.

It reminds me a bit of the first day of school. So, let's get this done, folks! Join us.\"\n\nThe Associated Press (AP) celebrated as well the fact that Kamala is the official Democratic presidential nominee despite never having been voted on by members of her party to hold the spot.\n\nOne of the big reasons why Kamala picked Walz is because he is \"a leading driver of Democrats' attacks on Trump,\" according to CNN. Democrats wanted an attack dog, in other words, which they got with Walz.\n\n(Related: Even the DNC's compliance manager believes that Kamala has no chance of winning - at least not without rigging the election.)\n\nWhile it was initially thought that Kamala would pick someone else like Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro or Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Walz took the spot after a viral cable news interview in which he called the nation's Republicans \"weird.\"\n\n\"Walz was also seen by many as a safer choice for Harris thanks to his liberal bona fides and the fact that some of the other contenders had come under fire from certain segments of the left,\" reported The Hill.\n\nKeep in mind that the same media celebrating Kamala's pick of Walz, who is 60 years old (but looks about 75), had previously criticized Republicans for nominating Trump, who is 78.\n\nWalz, by the way, failed to send in the National Guard in a timely fashion after the George Floyd incident, which is why parts of Minneapolis ended up burned to the ground in the 2020 summer of rage. Other actions by Walz that voters probably want to know include:\n\n- Fueling the George Floyd riots with his actions and rhetoric\n\n- Calling Trump supporters \"fascists\" after the recent assassination attempt\n\n- Championing extreme LGBT trans surgeries and abortion laws\n\nWalz also used to work for Israel Defense Forces (IDF); is a proud member of Antifa; and signed into law legislation allowing illegal aliens in Minnesota to obtain drivers' licenses.\n\nAs for the many Americans who are calling out Joe Biden for being too old and demented to occupy the Oval Office, Walz says these people are guilty of \"ageism\" because Biden is just fine, in his opinion.\n\n\"Two sickening commies to run against two sickening Zionists,\" one commenter wrote about the race between Kamala-Walz and Trump-Vance. \"Love it. What a cool country.\"\n\nAnother warned that World War III is sure to materialize if Walz ends up as vice president. During the Barack Obama years, Walz, a retired Army officer, told AIPAC that the U.S. supports Israel's settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem because Israel \"is our truest and closest ally in the region with a commitment to values of personal freedoms and liberties, surrounded by a pretty tough neighborhood.\"\n\n\"His daughter was an active loot and burner, too,\" noted another commenter about Walz's offspring.\n\nThe latest news about the 2024 presidential election can be found at Rigged.news."],"source":{"uri":["naturalnews.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["NaturalNews.com"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2024/08/Tim-Walz-Press-Conference.jpg"],"eventUri":["eng-9795783"],"sentiment":[0.1137],"wgt":[460760767],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["2024-08-447364461"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["20:53:13"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T20:53:13Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T20:44:22Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://gazette.com/news/wex/harris-resets-electoral-map-moving-three-states-in-democrats-favor/article_aacb4644-1782-52c8-9ba8-cf9661823c35.html"],"title":["Harris 'resets' electoral map, moving three states in Democrats' favor"],"body":["A nonpartisan election handicapper has updated ratings for three states in the 2024 presidential election cycle, shifting them toward Democrats after Vice President Kamala Harris became the party's nominee for president.\n\nSabato's Crystal Ball is now moving Georgia into the \"toss-up\" category, and Minnesota and New Hampshire are now rated as \"likely Democratic.\" Georgia had previously been identified as leaning Republican, and Minnesota and New Hampshire had been identified as likely Democratic.\n\nGeorgia has 11 electoral votes, Minnesota has 10, and New Hampshire has four. The election projector now shows Democrats with 226 electoral votes from states at a minimum leaning Democrat, while Republicans have 235 electoral votes from states that at least lean Republican. There are currently 77 votes in play from \"toss-up\" states.\n\nIn rationalizing the change in ratings, the group said in the weeks since Harris \"emerged as Democrats' standard-bearer, she has 'reset' the electoral map to some degree\" after polling better than President Joe Biden before he ended his 2024 run. Gov. Tim Walz's (D-MN), Harris's newly announced running mate, state also shifted toward the Democratic ticket.\n\n\"It appears that at least in the short term, Harris has reversed the slippage -- or has at least been able to stop the bleeding -- that Democrats have seen since the Biden-Trump debate in June,\" J. Miles Coleman of Sabato's Crystal Ball wrote.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"Looking nationally, Harris currently leads in all national polling aggregators. When Biden left the race, he was generally polling behind Trump.

Earlier in June, Georgia's rating was shifted from \"toss-up\" to \"leans Republican\" in the wake of Biden's poor debate performance in early June. At that time, Pennsylvania, which was once rated as \"leans Democratic,\" was changed to a \"toss-up,\" and the rating has not changed.\n\n\"Unlike Harris's other top prospect for the second-place position, Pennsylvania Gov.

Walz, the Democrat Party's nominee for vice president, purportedly never saw combat and left the service before his unit was sent to Iraq in 2005.\n\n\"We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war,\" Walz said in the past.\n\nHowever, a number of veterans who were personally familiar with Walz have now openly asserted that Harris's vice presidential pick never even deployed.\n\nRetired Command Sergeants Major Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr claimed in a letter published on Facebook in 2018 that during Walz's initial gubernatorial campaign, he left the National Guard after discovering his battalion would be sent to Iraq, even though he had promised his fellow soldiers that he would be joining them.\n\n\"On May 16, 2005, [Walz] quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war,\" wrote Behrends and Herr.\n\n60-year-old Walz left the military in time to begin his political career the next year, winning a congressional bid in 2006.\n\nAdditionally, Walz's radical far-left policies as governor has seemingly been ignored by left-wing mainstream media outlets, which praised him as a \"down-to-earth White guy\" who could win over rural America in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nMeanwhile, Walz has also made a number of offensive jokes about a true decorated war hero, JD Vance (R-Ohio), while viciously ridiculing him.\n\n\"I came from a family where nobody in my family had ever gone to law school, I grew up in a poor family,\" Vance said. \"The fact that Tim Walz wants to turn it into a bad thing is that I worked myself through college, through law school, and made something of myself. To me, that's the American dream, and if Tim Walz wants to insult it, frankly that's pretty bizarre.\"\n\nDonald Trump's running mate, Vance, was in the U.S. Marines and he was deployed to Iraq for six months in late 2005. The Ohio senator \"enlisted in the military directly out of high school\" and \"joined the Marines in 2003,\" serving as a \"combat correspondent,\" USA Today reported.\n\nA reporter had previously approached Vance in regards to Walz ridiculing him on his past service.\n\nAfter highlighting the extraordinary effort it required to fulfill his educational goals and after paying tribute to his modest beginnings, Vance unleashed a torrent of criticism on Walz for his heinous betrayal of his National Guard brethren.\n\n\"Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?\" Vance asked. \"What was this weapon you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went into Iraq? And he has not spent a day in a combat zone.\"\n\n\"Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, he dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him. I think that's shameful,\" Vance continued.\n\nStay informed! Receive breaking news blasts directly to your inbox for free.

The decrease in net revenues was primarily driven by a 14.0% decrease in volume of products sold, partially offset by a 6.1% increase in net revenue per pound. The increase in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by lower trade discounts, price increases of certain of our products in our U.S. retail and foodservice channels and, to a lesser extent, changes in product sales mix, partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nU.S. retail channel net revenues decreased 7.5% to $44.9 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $48.5 million in the year-ago period, primarily due to a 23.2% decrease in volume of products sold, primarily reflecting weak category demand and the lapping of substantial promotional sales to a club channel customer in the year-ago period, partially offset by a 20.5% increase in net revenue per pound, primarily driven by lower trade discounts, changes in product sales mix and price increases of certain of our products. U.S. retail channel net revenues included $0.8 million from ingredient sales in the quarter.\n\nU.S. foodservice channel net revenues decreased 18.9% to $10.4 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $12.8 million in the year-ago period, primarily due to a 20.0% decrease in volume of products sold, primarily reflecting weak category demand and, to a lesser extent, distribution losses, partially offset by a 1.4% increase in net revenue per pound, primarily driven by price increases of certain of our products and changes in product sales mix, partially offset by higher trade discounts.\n\nInternational retail channel net revenues decreased 12.1% to $17.6 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $20.0 million in the year-ago period, primarily due to a 6.9% decrease in net revenue per pound and a 5.5% decrease in volume of products sold, mainly reflecting reduced sales of chicken products in the EU and, to a lesser extent, demand softness in certain geographic regions. The decrease in net revenue per pound was primarily due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, increased trade discounts and pricing changes, partially offset by changes in product sales mix.\n\nInternational foodservice channel net revenues decreased 2.5% to $20.4 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $20.9 million in the year-ago period, primarily due to a 1.4% decrease in volume of products sold, and a 0.9% decrease in net revenue per pound, primarily resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in product sales mix, partially offset by lower trade discounts and pricing changes.\n\nNet revenues by channel (unaudited):\n\nThe following table presents the Company's net revenues by channel for the periods presented:\n\nThe following table presents consolidated volume of the Company's products sold in pounds for the periods presented:\n\nGross profit in the second quarter of 2024 was $13.7 million, or gross margin of 14.7%, compared to gross profit of $2.3 million, or gross margin of 2.2%, in the year-ago period. Gross profit and gross margin in the second quarter of 2024 were positively impacted by decreased cost of goods sold and increased net revenue per pound, partially offset by decreased volume of products sold. The decrease in cost of goods sold per pound primarily reflected lower inventory provision, lower manufacturing costs, including depreciation, and lower logistics costs, partially offset by higher materials costs.\n\nOperating expenses were $47.6 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $56.0 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to reduced marketing expenses and reduced non-production salaries and related costs, partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2024 included a $0.3 million increase in loss on sale of fixed assets compared to the year-ago period.\n\nLoss from operations was $33.9 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $53.8 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in loss from operations was driven by increased gross profit and reduced operating expenses.\n\nNet loss was $34.5 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $53.5 million in the year-ago period. Net loss per common share was $0.53 in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $0.83 in the year-ago period. The decrease in net loss was primarily driven by the reduction in loss from operations and a reduction in losses related to the Company's joint venture with PepsiCo, Inc., The Planet Partnership, LLC (\"TPP\"), partially offset by a reduction in Other income, net.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was a loss of $23.0 million, or -24.7% of net revenues, in the second quarter of 2024, compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $40.8 million, or -40.0% of net revenues, in the year-ago period.\n\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights\n\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents balance, including restricted cash, was $158.0 million and total outstanding debt was $1.1 billion as of June 29, 2024.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions, not historical fact, and involve certain risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by which or whether, such performance or results will be achieved. Actual results, levels of activity, performance, achievements and events could differ materially from those stated, anticipated or implied by such forward-looking statements. While Beyond Meat believes that its assumptions are reasonable, it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors and, of course, it is impossible to anticipate all factors that could affect actual results. There are many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements made herein including, but not limited to, the impact of inflation and higher interest rates across the economy, including higher food, grocery, raw materials, transportation, energy, labor and fuel costs; a continued decrease in demand, and the underlying factors negatively impacting demand, in the plant-based meat category; risks and uncertainties related to certain cost-reduction initiatives, cost structure improvements, workforce reductions and executive leadership changes, and the timing and success of reducing operating expenses and achieving certain financial goals and cash flow positive objectives;

Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful additional information to investors about current trends in the Company's operations and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of operations. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assess operating performance and for business planning purposes. Management also believes these measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts, rating agencies and other parties in evaluating companies in our industry as a measure of our operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\n\"Adjusted loss from operations\" is defined as loss from operations adjusted to exclude, when applicable, costs attributable to special items, which are those items deemed not to be reflective of the Company's ongoing normal business activities.\n\n\"Adjusted operating margin\" is defined as Adjusted loss from operations divided by net revenues.\n\n\"Adjusted net loss\" is defined as net loss adjusted to exclude, when applicable, costs attributable to special items, which are those items deemed not to be reflective of the Company's normal business activities.\n\n\"Adjusted net loss per diluted common share\" is defined as Adjusted net loss divided by the number of diluted common shares outstanding.\n\nWe consider Adjusted loss from operations, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted net loss and Adjusted net loss per diluted common share to be useful indicators of operating performance because excluding special items allows for period-over-period comparisons of our ongoing operations. Adjusted net loss per diluted common share is a performance measure and should not be used as a measure of liquidity.\n\n\"Adjusted EBITDA\" is defined as net loss adjusted to exclude, when applicable, income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, restructuring (income) expenses, share-based compensation expense, accrued litigation settlement costs and Other, net, including interest income, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses.\n\n\"Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net revenues\" is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenues.\n\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted loss from operations, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted net loss, Adjusted net loss per diluted common share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net revenues rather than their most directly comparable GAAP measures.

(\"Jushi\" or the \"Company\") (CSE: JUSH) (OTCQX: JUSHF), a vertically integrated, multi-state cannabis operator, is pleased to announce its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024 (\"Q2 2024\"). All financial information is unaudited and provided in U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated and is prepared under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\").\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights\n\nSee \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\" and \"Unaudited Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin\" below.\n\nManagement Commentary\n\n\"Our second quarter performance underscores our efforts to strengthen our asset base while maintaining prudent cost-saving measures, and we believe this will help position us on a steady path to sustained profitability,\" said Jim Cacioppo, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman, and Founder of Jushi. \"Our organization-wide operational improvement plan is yielding promising results, with gross margin reaching 50.4% and Adjusted EBITDA further improving to 22.4% of revenue for the quarter. These successes were driven by efficiencies achieved mainly at our Virginia grower-processor facility and our ability to maintain a consistent output of our high-margin, top-selling product offerings. Additionally, Todd West, our newly appointed COO, has already played a crucial role in guiding additional enhancements across our business and we anticipate further progress throughout the remainder of the year under his direction.\"\n\nMr. Cacioppo continued, \"Our commercialization strategy remains a pivotal driver of our performance improvements, particularly in markets such as Ohio and Virginia. This includes the diversification of our brands and product offering with new, exclusive cultivars, and consistent enhancements to quality, potency, and yields. Throughout the second quarter, we launched an additional 308 new, high-margin SKUs across our footprint, bringing our year-to-date total to an impressive 751 new SKUs. We were thrilled to bring our full offerings of The Lab and Tasteology brands to Nevada to bolster our presence in this market, as well as launch our highly anticipated The Lab 2g vape cartridges in Pennsylvania. Our wholesale business also continues to perform well, particularly in Ohio which saw a 110% sequential and 76% year-over-year sales increase, signaling an encouraging trajectory following yesterday's launch of non-medical sales in the commonwealth. We will continue to scale our operations in Ohio, with plans to expand our capacity by approximately 15,000 square feet of double stacked cultivation, upgrades to our newly enhanced processing operations, as well as the anticipated opening of a non-medical dispensary in Springdale during the first quarter of 2025.\"\n\nMr. Cacioppo concluded, \"Subsequent to the quarter end, we took crucial steps to enhance our capital structure by reducing our debt to increase our financial flexibility, aligning us positively for the second half of the year. We've successfully refinanced our Acquisition Facility debt with a new term loan in the amount of $48.5 million and payments in July of $6.8 million from cash on hand. In addition, we repaid $3.6 million of promissory notes. With this strategic move, we are in a stronger position to further pursue expansion opportunities in Ohio following the launch of non-medical sales, as well as developing markets such as Pennsylvania and Virginia. As we believe a number of potential exciting regulatory developments may occur in the near-term, we remain vigilant for the anticipated rapid growth in several of our key markets, including Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.\"\n\nFinancial Results for the Second Quarter Ended June 30, 2024\n\n($ in millions)\n\nRevenue in Q2 2024 decreased 2.8% to $64.6 million as compared to $66.4 million in Q2 2023. The year-over-year decrease in revenue can be attributed to:\n\nThese declines were partially offset by an increase in sales in Virginia of 18% primarily due to the opening of one new store in August 2023. The Company ended the quarter with thirty-five operating dispensaries in seven states, as compared to thirty-four in seven states at the end of Q2 2023.\n\nWholesale revenue increased 11.6% year-over-year to $7.6 million in Q2 2024 as compared to $6.8 million in Q2 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to wholesale revenue growth in Virginia of 72% as the cultivation and processing facility in Virginia matured and had more product available for sale to third-parties. The growth in Virginia was partially offset by a 37% decline in wholesale revenue in Massachusetts due to continued competition.\n\nGross profit in Q2 2024 was $32.6 million, or 50.4% of revenue, compared to $30.6 million, or 46.0% of revenue in Q2 2023. The increase in gross profit and gross profit margin was driven by efficiencies at our cultivation and processing facilities which have enabled us to be more competitive on cost. During Q2 2024, we generated positive gross profit and gross profit margin from our wholesale revenue whereas in Q2 2023, we generated a loss. In our retail channel, gross profit declined due to lower sales; however, gross profit margin improved 110 basis points as a result of increased sell-through of Jushi branded products at our retail stores. Jushi branded product sales as a percentage of total retail revenue were 56% in Q2 2024 across the Company's five vertical markets compared to 47% in the prior year.\n\nOperating expenses for Q2 2024 were $24.2 million, compared to $27.2 million in Q2 2023, a reduction of $3.0 million or 11.0% year-over-year. The decrease was due primarily to (i) lower share-based compensation expense which reflects lower value of share-based compensation granted as well as forfeitures; and (ii) gains on the sale of certain non-core assets and operating lease terminations. These declines were partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense due to the expansion of our retail operations which resulted in certain fixed assets placed into service, as well amortization of our business licenses which commenced during the current quarter as we concluded, based on our assessment, that the Company's business licenses no longer have indefinite useful lives.\n\nNet loss for Q2 2024 was $1.9 million, primarily due to other expense, net of $1.0 million and income tax expense of $9.3 million, which was partially offset by income from operations of $8.4 million. Other expense, net, included interest expense of $9.1 million, which was partially offset by fair value gain on derivatives of $5.3 million and other income, net of $2.7 million.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in Q2 2024 was $14.5 million compared to $12.6 million in Q2 2023, representing an improvement of $1.9 million year-over-year.\n\nSee \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\" and \"Unaudited Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin\" below.\n\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $35.0 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company paid approximately $1.8 million in capital expenditures. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $11.1 million and $200.4 million in gross principal amount of short-term and long-term total debt, respectively, excluding leases and property, plant, and equipment financing obligations. Subsequent to the quarter end, the company reduced its total gross debt by approximately $10.5 million which includes $2.4 million for the July 1st regularly scheduled payment on the Acquisition Facility, $4.3 million payment in connection with the refinancing of the Acquisition Facility, as well as early extinguishment of $3.8 million in promissory notes. As a result, our short-term debt reduced to less than $1.0 million. Excluding the $21.5 million notes payable to Sammartino, as we currently have no obligation to repay these notes, the total debt balance subject to scheduled repayments after the post-quarter end payments was $180 million.\n\nAs of August 2, 2024, the Company's issued and outstanding shares were 196,643,264 and its fully diluted shares outstanding were 330,964,842.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\n\nThe Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial information provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations. For further information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please refer to the \"Unaudited Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin\" section of this press release.\n\nConference Call and Webcast Information\n\nThe Company will host a conference call and audio webcast for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024 at 4:30 p.m. ET today, Wednesday, August 7, 2024.\n\nFor interested individuals unable to join the conference call, a webcast of the call will be available for one month following the conference call and can be accessed via webcast on Jushi's Investor Relations website.\n\nAbout Jushi Holdings Inc.\n\nWe are a vertically integrated cannabis company led by an industry-leading management team.

We use non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes and to evaluate our financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin (each as defined below). We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect our ongoing business by excluding the effects of expenses that are not reflective of our operating business performance and allow for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in our business. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies. As there are no standardized methods of calculating these non-GAAP measures, our methods may differ from those used by others, and accordingly, the use of these measures may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by others, thus limiting their usefulness. Accordingly, these non-GAAP measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are financial measures that are not defined under GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income (loss), or \"earnings\", before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before: (i) non-cash share-based compensation expense; (ii) inventory-related adjustments; (iii) fair value changes in derivatives; (iv) other (income)/expense items; (v) transaction costs; (vi) asset impairment; (vii) gain/loss on debt extinguishment; and (viii) start-up costs. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue. These financial measures are metrics that have been adjusted from the GAAP net income (loss) measure in an effort to provide readers with a normalized metric in making comparisons more meaningful across the cannabis industry, as well as to remove non-recurring, irregular and one-time items that may otherwise distort the GAAP net income measure. Other companies in our industry may calculate this measure differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures."],"source":{"uri":["greenstocknews.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Green Stock News"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://greenstocknews.com/images/ogimage.jpg"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.4902],"wgt":[460758151],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8264156737"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["20:19:26"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T20:19:26Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T20:18:17Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.socialnews.xyz/?p=6054001"],"title":["Where Trump, Harris stand on abortion rights (Video)"],"body":["Ahead of the 2024 presidential election, CBS News' Lana Zak breaks down how Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are defining their stances on abortion rights as reproductive care and women's health continue to resonate as top issues in this election.\n\nCBS News 24/7 is the premier anchored streaming news service from CBS News and Stations that is available free to everyone with access to the internet and is the destination for breaking news, live events, original reporting and storytelling, and programs from CBS News and Stations' top anchors and correspondents working locally, nationally and around the globe.

(\"Jushi\" or the \"Company\") (CSE: JUSH) (OTCQX: JUSHF), a vertically integrated, multi-state cannabis operator, is pleased to announce its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024 (\"Q2 2024\"). All financial information is unaudited and provided in U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated and is prepared under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\").\n\nSee \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\" and \"Unaudited Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin\" below.\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Company Highlights\n\nPost Quarter-End Developments\n\nManagement Commentary\n\n\"Our second quarter performance underscores our efforts to strengthen our asset base while maintaining prudent cost-saving measures, and we believe this will help position us on a steady path to sustained profitability,\" said Jim Cacioppo, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman, and Founder of Jushi. \"Our organization-wide operational improvement plan is yielding promising results, with gross margin reaching 50.4% and Adjusted EBITDA further improving to 22.4% of revenue for the quarter. These successes were driven by efficiencies achieved mainly at our Virginia grower-processor facility and our ability to maintain a consistent output of our high-margin, top-selling product offerings. Additionally, Todd West, our newly appointed COO, has already played a crucial role in guiding additional enhancements across our business and we anticipate further progress throughout the remainder of the year under his direction.\"\n\nMr. Cacioppo continued, \"Our commercialization strategy remains a pivotal driver of our performance improvements, particularly in markets such as Ohio and Virginia. This includes the diversification of our brands and product offering with new, exclusive cultivars, and consistent enhancements to quality, potency, and yields. Throughout the second quarter, we launched an additional 308 new, high-margin SKUs across our footprint, bringing our year-to-date total to an impressive 751 new SKUs. We were thrilled to bring our full offerings of The Lab and Tasteology brands to Nevada to bolster our presence in this market, as well as launch our highly anticipated The Lab 2g vape cartridges in Pennsylvania. Our wholesale business also continues to perform well, particularly in Ohio which saw a 110% sequential and 76% year-over-year sales increase, signaling an encouraging trajectory following yesterday's launch of non-medical sales in the commonwealth. We will continue to scale our operations in Ohio, with plans to expand our capacity by approximately 15,000 square feet of double stacked cultivation, upgrades to our newly enhanced processing operations, as well as the anticipated opening of a non-medical dispensary in Springdale during the first quarter of 2025.\"\n\nMr. Cacioppo concluded, \"Subsequent to the quarter end, we took crucial steps to enhance our capital structure by reducing our debt to increase our financial flexibility, aligning us positively for the second half of the year. We've successfully refinanced our Acquisition Facility debt with a new term loan in the amount of $48.5 million and payments in July of $6.8 million from cash on hand. In addition, we repaid $3.6 million of promissory notes. With this strategic move, we are in a stronger position to further pursue expansion opportunities in Ohio following the launch of non-medical sales, as well as developing markets such as Pennsylvania and Virginia. As we believe a number of potential exciting regulatory developments may occur in the near-term, we remain vigilant for the anticipated rapid growth in several of our key markets, including Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.\"\n\nFinancial Results for the Second Quarter Ended June 30, 2024\n\n($ in millions)\n\nRevenue in Q2 2024 decreased 2.8% to $64.6 million as compared to $66.4 million in Q2 2023. The year-over-year decrease in revenue can be attributed to:\n\nThese declines were partially offset by an increase in sales in Virginia of 18% primarily due to the opening of one new store in August 2023. The Company ended the quarter with thirty-five operating dispensaries in seven states, as compared to thirty-four in seven states at the end of Q2 2023.\n\nWholesale revenue increased 11.6% year-over-year to $7.6 million in Q2 2024 as compared to $6.8 million in Q2 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to wholesale revenue growth in Virginia of 72% as the cultivation and processing facility in Virginia matured and had more product available for sale to third-parties. The growth in Virginia was partially offset by a 37% decline in wholesale revenue in Massachusetts due to continued competition.\n\nGross profit in Q2 2024 was $32.6 million, or 50.4% of revenue, compared to $30.6 million, or 46.0% of revenue in Q2 2023. The increase in gross profit and gross profit margin was driven by efficiencies at our cultivation and processing facilities which have enabled us to be more competitive on cost. During Q2 2024, we generated positive gross profit and gross profit margin from our wholesale revenue whereas in Q2 2023, we generated a loss. In our retail channel, gross profit declined due to lower sales; however, gross profit margin improved 110 basis points as a result of increased sell-through of Jushi branded products at our retail stores. Jushi branded product sales as a percentage of total retail revenue were 56% in Q2 2024 across the Company's five vertical markets compared to 47% in the prior year.\n\nOperating expenses for Q2 2024 were $24.2 million, compared to $27.2 million in Q2 2023, a reduction of $3.0 million or 11.0% year-over-year. The decrease was due primarily to (i) lower share-based compensation expense which reflects lower value of share-based compensation granted as well as forfeitures; and (ii) gains on the sale of certain non-core assets and operating lease terminations. These declines were partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense due to the expansion of our retail operations which resulted in certain fixed assets placed into service, as well amortization of our business licenses which commenced during the current quarter as we concluded, based on our assessment, that the Company's business licenses no longer have indefinite useful lives.\n\nNet loss for Q2 2024 was $1.9 million, primarily due to other expense, net of $1.0 million and income tax expense of $9.3 million, which was partially offset by income from operations of $8.4 million. Other expense, net, included interest expense of $9.1 million, which was partially offset by fair value gain on derivatives of $5.3 million and other income, net of $2.7 million.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in Q2 2024 was $14.5 million compared to $12.6 million in Q2 2023, representing an improvement of $1.9 million year-over-year.\n\nSee \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\" and \"Unaudited Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin\" below.\n\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $35.0 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company paid approximately $1.8 million in capital expenditures. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $11.1 million and $200.4 million in gross principal amount of short-term and long-term total debt, respectively, excluding leases and property, plant, and equipment financing obligations. Subsequent to the quarter end, the company reduced its total gross debt by approximately $10.5 million which includes $2.4 million for the July 1st regularly scheduled payment on the Acquisition Facility, $4.3 million payment in connection with the refinancing of the Acquisition Facility, as well as early extinguishment of $3.8 million in promissory notes. As a result, our short-term debt reduced to less than $1.0 million. Excluding the $21.5 million notes payable to Sammartino, as we currently have no obligation to repay these notes, the total debt balance subject to scheduled repayments after the post-quarter end payments was $180 million.\n\nAs of August 2, 2024, the Company's issued and outstanding shares were 196,643,264 and its fully diluted shares outstanding were 330,964,842.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\n\nThe Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial information provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations.

Does she mean more than just abortion?"],"body":["With less than 100 days to go before the 2024 presidential election, the Democratic ticket has pivoted hard in the direction of \"freedom\" as a campaign strategy. But how serious are they about it, really?\n\nWithin 48 hours of President Joe Biden ending his reelection campaign, Vice President Kamala Harris locked up enough of his delegates to secure the Democratic nomination. Yesterday, Harris announced her choice for running mate: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a plain-speaking progressive who pioneered the strategy of calling Republicans \"weird.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, at their first joint campaign rally in Philadelphia, Walz deployed some of the folksiness that apparently won him Harris' pick. On the topic of abortion rights, he offered some choice words for their opponents.\n\n\"Some of us are old enough to remember when it was Republicans who were talking about freedom. It turns out now, what they meant was, the government should be free to invade your doctor's office,\" he said. \"In Minnesota, we respect our neighbors and the personal choices that they make. Even if we wouldn't make the same choice for ourselves, there's a golden rule: mind your own damn business!\" The crowd erupted in cheers and applause, and Walz said he heard chants of \"mind your own damn business.\"\n\nIn a fawning segment on his MSNBC show, Lawrence O'Donnell called Walz's turn of phrase \"nothing less than the single best political message the Democrats have ever delivered about abortion and reproductive freedom.\"\n\nIndeed, the message is striking -- even downright libertarian. It fits well into Harris' campaign theme, in which she dropped Biden's focus on \"democracy\" in favor of \"freedom.\" Within days of securing her party's presumptive nomination, Harris deployed her first campaign ad, which not only chose \"freedom\" as its theme but featured the Beyoncé song of the same name.\n\nBut Harris' ad, like Walz's declaration at the rally, is unfortunately limited in its view of what \"freedom\" truly means.\n\n\"We choose freedom,\" Harris intones in her ad, \"the freedom not just to get by, but get ahead; the freedom to be safe from gun violence; the freedom to make decisions about your own body. We choose a future where no child lives in poverty, where we can all afford health care, where no one is above the law\" -- that last one delivered over an image of former President Donald Trump's mug shot taken last year in Georgia.\n\nLibertarians may feel that much of this rhetoric stretches the definition of what freedom truly means. After all, \"the freedom to be safe from gun violence\" is a laudable goal, but in practice, it seems to run against the constitutionally guaranteed right to keep and bear arms. \"Throughout her career, Harris has been a vocal advocate for reinstating a ban on assault weapons, the weapon of choice for mass shooters and extremists,\" touts a press release from the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety. \"As California Attorney General, Harris led the fight to pass a Red Flag law, becoming only the third state at the time to do so.\" Walz, as Minnesota's governor, similarly signed legislation to institute red flag laws.\n\nIf you truly believe in \"the freedom not just to get by, but get ahead,\" then you should support making it as easy as possible for a person to earn a living.\n\nYet the Biden-Harris administration has favored tougher enforcement of tax laws in ways that would disadvantage people with lower incomes. While gig economy companies like Uber and Etsy were previously required to report users to the IRS who earn at least $20,000 on their platform, a provision in Biden's 2021 pandemic relief bill would have lowered the threshold to $600. And when the administration proposed hiring 87,000 new IRS agents, it suggested that the extra enforcement would allow the agency to monitor people's use of services like PayPal and Venmo, to make sure their transactions match their reported incomes.\n\nThe Harris ad's support for \"the freedom to make decisions about your own body\" is also commendable, as is Walz's exhortation for anti-abortion Republicans to \"mind your own damn business.\" But that involves more than just abortion rights: It also includes the right to access experimental drug treatments that have not been officially sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). MDMA, for example, shows great promise for treating mental health disorders like post-traumatic stress, but the FDA has yet to approve its use, and in June, an FDA advisory panel voted overwhelmingly to recommend against approval.\n\nTrue bodily autonomy would also include the right to take drugs that are approved in other countries but have not been sanctioned by the FDA. But the Right to Try Act of 2017 was introduced by a Republican, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), and signed into law by Trump, who bragged about the law in his speech at the Republican National Convention. But the FDA reported that in 2023, only four drugs were used under Right to Try.\n\n\"While more exceptions made more often would be an improvement on the status quo, the need for these exceptions and the extremely high stakes for obtaining them shows that there is something deeply wrong with the underlying process,\" Reason Editor in Chief Katherine Mangu-Ward wrote in 2021 about the FDA.\n\nIn fairness, Harris and Walz have been liberty-friendly on other issues: Last year, Walz signed a bill legalizing recreational marijuana in Minnesota. And despite a history of locking up marijuana users as a prosecutor in California, she has been a more forceful advocate of legalization than either Trump or Biden.\n\nBut if the Democratic presidential ticket is going to choose \"freedom\" as its rhetorical guiding light, the candidates should consider opening up their respective definitions of what that means and the numerous ways in which people can be free. \"Mind your own damn business\" makes a perfect rallying cry for more than just abortion and reproductive rights."],"source":{"uri":["reason.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Reason"]},"authors":[{"uri":["joe_lancaster@reason.com"],"name":["Joe Lancaster"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2024/08/rollcallpix160386-scaled.jpg"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.2392],"wgt":[460757380],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8264142304"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["20:06:13"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T20:06:13Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T20:05:30Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://lacrossetribune.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/elections/wisconsin-marquette-law-school-poll-kamala-harris-donald-trump-eric-hovde-tammy-baldwin-charles-franklin-election-2024/article_8705c452-e056-57e6-928c-dd9d61bc0705.html"],"title":["Harris, Trump dead even in latest Wisconsin poll"],"body":["Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz appeared at a Pennsylvania rally together on Tuesday just hours after it was announced Walz had joined the Democratic ticket, giving many Americans their first glimpse at the vice presidential hopeful.\n\nAs is almost always the case in Wisconsin, the upcoming presidential election still appears to be a toss up in the battleground state, despite Vice President Kamala Harris replacing President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket to challenge former President Donald Trump in November, a Marquette Law School Poll released Wednesday shows.\n\nBut while Wisconsin continues to live up to its reputation as a key swing state, Marquette's new poll does underscore that Harris' entry into the race appears to have boosted Democratic voters' enthusiasm following several previous polls this year that showed Republicans largely holding the advantage when it came to their level of enthusiasm to vote this fall.\n\nThe latest poll comes after several tumultuous weeks surrounding the 2024 presidential election; including Biden's poor debate performance in late June; the assassination attempt against Trump just days before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee; Harris' transition to the Democratic Party's presidential nominee after Biden dropped out of the race; and the announcement of both presidential candidates' running mates -- Harris' selection of Minnesota Gov.

The margin of error among likely voters is 4.8%.\n\nHarris officially launched her campaign in late July after Biden, who faced mounting pressure from within the Democratic Party following his poor debate performance with Trump in June, ended his re-election bid. On Monday, Democratic National Convention delegates formally approved Harris as the party's presidential nominee.\n\nAmong Democratic registered voters, 92% said they're very or somewhat satisfied with Harris as the party's nominee, compared with 7% who said they're very or somewhat dissatisfied with the choice, according to Marquette's latest poll.\n\n\"The bottom line is Democrats are pretty satisfied with Harris as the nominee,\" Poll Director Charles Franklin said.\n\nMarquette's June poll, the last conducted before Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed his vice president, found Biden and Trump locked in a dead even race, with both candidates receiving support from 50% of registered voters -- largely mirroring results from Marquette's previous polling this year.\n\nIn a hypothetical matchup in the latest poll asking registered voters who they'd support if Biden remained in the race, 47% of respondents backed Trump, compared with 42% supporting Biden. Another 10% of respondents said they did not know.\n\nThe poll, which was conducted by phone and online July 24 - August 1 and surveyed 877 registered voters, wrapped up before Harris picked Walz as her running mate on Tuesday. Harris and Walz held a rally in Eau Claire Wednesday afternoon. The visit is Harris' sixth to the battleground state this year and second since Biden dropped out of the race.\n\nVance also traveled to Eau Claire Wednesday as he trails Harris on her tour this week of battleground states. Vance secured the GOP vice presidential nomination last month at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nU.S. Senate\n\nIn a race that could determine which party controls the U.S. Senate next year, Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Madison, continues to maintain her narrow lead over Republican businessman Eric Hovde, also of Madison. Among registered voters, 53% back Baldwin, compared with 46% supporting Hovde.\n\nThe margin remains comparable to Marquette's June poll, which found Baldwin receiving support from 52% of both registered and likely voters, compared with 47% for Hovde. April polling found Baldwin backed by 52% of registered voters, compared with Hovde's 47%. That poll found the race to be evenly split among likely voters, with both candidates receiving 50%.\n\nIn terms of favorability, Baldwin has remained largely consistent, with 44% of registered voters saying they have a favorable view of the incumbent, while 44% said they have an unfavorable view. Another 12% of respondents said they hadn't heard enough about Baldwin to form an opinion.\n\nTo compare, Baldwin was viewed favorably by 40% of respondents in Marquette's June 2023 poll, compared with 37% who viewed her unfavorably and 22% who said they hadn't heard enough about her.\n\nHovde, who entered the race in February, has been working to build his name recognition heading into the Republican primary next Tuesday.\n\nWhile 85% of respondents said in June 2023 they hadn't heard enough about the Madison business owner to form an opinion, that number has since dropped to 38% in the most recent poll. But while the number of respondents who have a favorable view of Hovde has grown from 19% in April to 24% this month, those who have an unfavorable view has grown from 24% to 37% in that same timeframe.\n\n\"So far, people making his acquaintance have been more likely to form unfavorable views,\" Franklin said. \"Especially if you think about everything that's happened this summer, the senate race really has been kind of lost in the turmoil at the presidential level. Once we get through the primary and get through the DNC, I think we'll see the senate race fully engaged, but it will still be in the shadow of the presidential, of course.\"\n\nEnthusiasm\n\nWhile the race between Harris and Trump appears deadlocked, similar to how Biden matched up with the former president, Harris' entry into the race does appear to have boosted Democratic voters' level of enthusiasm heading into November.\n\nSixty-one percent of registered voters said they are very enthusiastic to vote this fall, compared with just 46% in Marquette's June survey. Voter enthusiasm had remained between 46% and 49% in Marquette's four previous polls dating back to October 2023, marking a considerable dip when compared to polling conducted in August 2020, when 62% of registered voters said they were very enthusiastic to vote.\n\n\"This is just the direct evidence of how much enthusiasm changed,\" Franklin said.\n\nMuch of those gains appear to have occurred among Democratic voters. Among those who say they are very enthusiastic to vote, 47% support Harris, compared with 52% for Trump. In Marquette's June poll, 61% of very enthusiastic voters supported Trump, while 39% backed Biden.\n\n\"Now we're seeing nearly equal levels of enthusiasm within Republicans and Democrats,\" Franklin said.\n\nAsked who they think will win the presidential election, 51% of respondents said Trump is definitely or probably going to win, compared with 38% who said Harris will likely win.\n\nIn a hypothetical matchup between Biden and Trump, only 20% of registered voters said Biden would have definitely or likely won the November election, compared with 69% who said Trump would win.\n\n\"Even though the race is incredibly close in terms of people's voting preferences, the perception that Trump has an advantage going into the fall still remains,\" Franklin said.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nLocations Madison Get Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national government and political topics with our newsletter.\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."],"source":{"uri":["lacrossetribune.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["La Crosse Tribune"]},"authors":[{"uri":["mitchell_schmidt_mschmidt@lacrossetribune.com"],"name":["Mitchell Schmidt Mschmidt"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/lacrossetribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/70/8705c452-e056-57e6-928c-dd9d61bc0705/66b3ccce84ff2.preview.jpg?crop=1682%2C884%2C6%2C68&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.098],"wgt":[460757173],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8264136573"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["20:00:53"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T20:00:53Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T20:00:05Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://uk.pcmag.com/security/153775/us-cybersecurity-chief-dont-get-your-election-info-from-influencers"],"title":["US Cybersecurity Chief: Don't Get Your Election Info From Influencers"],"body":["LAS VEGAS -- Black Hat 2024 started off with warnings about election security tinged with optimism about the future of democracy around the world.

Tim Walz to join the ticket. The governor was relatively unknown before Tuesday but his history, experience and record are now being scrutinized as voters and pollsters attempt to determine how this decision will impact the race.\n\nHere's a closer look at how voters are feeling amid this unusual and rapidly shifting race for the White House.\n\nGenerally, Harris has been rising in the polls since it was announced that she would be running and became the Democratic party's presumptive nominee -- although she's only beating the former president out by a small margin so far.\n\nThe smallest margins are seen in the latest CBS News and New York Times polls.\n\nCBS shows Harris leading Trump but one point nationally. The poll was released Sunday and suggests that Harris' boost is due in part to younger and Black voters, who appear to be more engaged and therefore more likely to vote, and by women who believe Harris will favor their interests.\n\nThe New York Times also puts Harris one point ahead of Trump, noting significant improvement from when her candidacy was hypothetical to when she secured enough delegates to become the party's presumptive nominee. Harris will officially be confirmed as the nominee at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which could bring a further jump for the vice president.\n\nThe latest Morning Consult poll released Monday hows that Harris is steadily extending her lead. Their numbers show Harris leading Trump 48% to 44% with 5% of registered voters saying they would vote for \"someone else\" and 4% saying they don't know. It's the third consecutive week that the poll has shown Harris ahead of Trump.\n\nAccording to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist National Poll, Harris leads Trump by 3 percentage points with 51% of the vote compared to Trump's 48%. Two percent of respondents remain undecided. The gap widens among independent voters with 53% saying they would vote for Harris and 44% saying they would vote for Trump. Among those independents, 3% are undecided.\n\nTrump isn't down in all the polls though. He was leading Harris in the July Harvard CAPS-Harris poll by four points -- 52% to 48%. A Wall Street Journal poll published shortly after Biden dropped out showed the former president was beating Harris 49% to 47%, though they noted that Harris' entry into the race effectively ended the solid lead Trump had over Biden amid the serious age concerns troubling young voters.\n\nIn a poll generated by RealClearPolitics, which averages the latest data from 11 major polling sites, Harris leads Trump by a 0.5% margin. That small lead is exemplified by data that shows while she has an overall favorable outlook nationally, Harris and Trump face extremely tight races in battleground states including Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nIt's a bit early to see how adding Walz name to the ticket is going to impact the race. The governor was little-known outside of his home state ahead of the announcement and voters are still familiarizing themselves with his record.\n\nAt a rally Tuesday, Harris spoke to Walz's accolades, highlighting his progressive policies that led to legislation protecting women's reproductive rights, cutting taxes for the middle class, expanding paid leave for workers and establishing free school meal programs statewide.\n\nBut according to another NPR/PBS News/Marist National survey published Tuesday, nearly three-fourths of registered voters said they didn't know enough about Walz to have either a favorable or unfavorable impression of him. Just 17% of those surveyed said they viewed Walz positively and 12% said they had an unfavorable view of him.\n\nOverall, Walz favored lower than others who made the shortlist of contenders for the vice presidential nomination. Mark Kelly and Josh Shapiro were better known and more popular than Walz.\n\nIt's yet to be seen how voters react to Walz but his folksy, Midwestern roots and past professions as both a high school teacher and football coach, and a military veteran are seen as overwhelmingly favorable traits. It could be the key to boosting Harris' chances at the White House.\n\nWalz is also an outspoken gun owner but believes in stricter regulation -- a middle-of-the-road approach to a contentious issue that could attract moderate voters.\n\nSupport for 60-year-old Walz appears to be growing on social media, particularly with a viral clip of the governor starting the Harris campaign's \"weird\" attack line against former President Donald Trump and JD Vance.\n\n\"These are weird people on the other side.

Mark Warner, D-Va., issued back in May, where companies including X, Google, Anthropic, Meta, Microsoft and McAfee provided details about their internal commitments to monitoring their online platforms for AI-augmented content related to the forthcoming 2024 presidential elections. That's out of the 24 total companies Warner sent letters to as signatories of the AI Elections Accord established in February at the Munich Tech Conference.\n\n\"I appreciate the thoughtful engagement from the signatories of the Munich Tech Accord,\" Warner said in a press release. \"Their responses indicated promising avenues for collaboration, information-sharing, and standards development, but also illuminated areas for significant improvement.\"\n\nThe content of each company's letter varied. Leadership from social media site X, formerly Twitter, said that its internal Safety Teams are continuing to monitor the validity of content published on its platform.\n\n\"In times of elections and at all times, we believe that it is critical to maintain the authenticity of the conversation on X,\" Wifredo Fernández, X's head of U.S. and Canada global government affairs, wrote. \"Our Safety teams remain alert to any attempt to manipulate the platform by bad actors and networks. We have a robust policy in place to prevent platform spam and manipulation, and we routinely take down accounts engaged in this type of behavior.\"\n\nMeta, the parent company of platforms like Facebook and Instagram, referenced the company's new approaches to identifying and labeling AI generated content, as well as requiring third-party advertisers to disclose when they leverage AI technology in their image generation.\n\n\"We remain focused on providing people reliable election information while combating misinformation across languages,\" the letter, signed by Meta's Vice President of North America Policy Kevin Martin wrote. \"We know this work is bigger than any one company and will require a huge effort across industry, government, and civil society. We will continue to work collaboratively with others to develop common standards and guardrails.\"\n\nMartin also noted that the company is employing strict licensing regimes for its proprietary Llama 2 and 3 large language AI models, notably requiring that Meta retain auditing authorities.\n\nMichael Beckerman, the vice president and head of public policy of Americas at TikTok, also sent a letter noting that his company does not allow paid political ads on the video platform, and that TikTok focuses on actively removing \"harmful\" content, including AI-generated material. The platform will also label AI-generated content which contains specific, realistic imagery.\n\nCompanies building AI and large language models, like Anthropic and OpenAI, also issued letters to Warner. Anthropic Chief Executive Officer Dario Amodei said that the company both warns end users about misusing its AI models, such as the generative interface Claude, but is taking stronger steps to route user inputs to factual information.\n\n\"In the United States, we are implementing an approach where we use our classifier and rules engine to identify election-related queries and redirect users to accurate, up-to-date authoritative voting information,\" Amodei wrote. \"While generative AI systems have a broad range of positive uses, our own research has shown that they can still be prone to hallucinations, where they produce incorrect information in response to some prompts.\"\n\nGiven that Anthropic's models are not trained in a timely manner to validate every election-related question, the company is guiding users away from entering queries where errors or hallucinations would be \"unacceptable\" and toward official websites.\n\nSimilarly, OpenAI is redirecting users to \"authoritative sources of information\" when a potentially sensitive search query is detected, and also said it is developing new tools within its AI model offerings to effectively label AI-generated content.\n\n\"OpenAI is also developing a detection image classifier -- a tool that uses artificial intelligence to assess the likelihood that an image was created using DALLE 3,\" Anna Makanju, the vice president of global affairs at OpenAI, wrote, along with tamper-resistant watermarking.\n\nDespite the detail offered by the responding entities, Warner said that he was \"disappointed\" in the lack of information the letters offered on specific company reporting structures to counter digital impersonation of election and political officials.\n\n\"Lastly -- and perhaps most relevant ahead of the 2024 Presidential Election -- I am deeply concerned by the lack of robust and standardized information-sharing mechanisms within the ecosystem,\" Warner said in the press release. \"With the election less than 100 days away, we must prioritize real action and robust communication to systematically catalogue harmful AI-generated content.\"\n\nA common issue mentioned by responding companies was that the AI landscape is rapidly changing and innovating, making rapid responses to fraudulent content, online impersonation and other misinformation, particularly challenging.\n\n\"The history of AI development has been characterized by rapid advancements and novel applications,\" Amodei wrote on behalf of Anthropic. \"We expect that 2024 will bring forth new uses of AI systems, which is why we are proactively building methods to identify and monitor novel uses of our systems as they emerge. We will communicate openly and frankly about what we discover.\"\n\nAs the U.S.'s 2024 Presidential election looms, multiple experts, including the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, have cited synthetic AI-generated content as a notable threat to election security operations.\n\nSpeaking before a Senate hearing in May, CISA Director Jen Easterly said that, against a complex threat landscape, her agency is partnering with private tech companies to establish misinformation mitigation tactics.\n\nIn Las Vegas, Easterly told a group of reporters at the Black Hat cybersecurity conference on Wednesday that she has not yet viewed the responses from the companies, but that a meeting with them is expected in the coming weeks."],"source":{"uri":["nextgov.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Nextgov"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/cd/2024/08/07/080724WarnerNG/860x394.jpg"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.2471],"wgt":[460756303],"relevance":[13]},{"uri":["8264126043"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["19:50:49"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T19:50:49Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T19:49:57Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://me.pcmag.com/en/security/25188/us-cybersecurity-chief-dont-get-your-election-info-from-influencers"],"title":["US Cybersecurity Chief: Don't Get Your Election Info From Influencers"],"body":["LAS VEGAS -- Black Hat 2024 started off with warnings about election security tinged with optimism about the future of democracy around the world. This year's big question is, \"What can the cybersecurity community do to ensure safe and secure elections?\" After all, some 50 elections, including the US presidential election, are set to happen in 2024.\n\n\"Elections are complicated,\" Jen Easterly, director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), said on a panel of US and EU cybersecurity experts. \"I can guarantee that things will go wrong. The good news is: These types of events are disruptive, but they won't invalidate the votes cast.\"\n\nEasterly stressed that the best way to protect democracy is to ignore or invalidate attempts to spread disinformation and misinformation about elections or election results. \"Identify the signal through the noise,\" she said, warning that there will be attempts to spread lies or half-truths in the lead-up to and after the 2024 presidential election.\n\nFelicity Oswald, CEO of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), had a similar warning. AI-generated memes are fun, but they can also be used to spread false information and influence people around high-profile elections, she said.\n\nEasterly urged people to get information from local, state, and federal officials, not social media influencers, media outlets, or politicians. If you're in the US, visit the National Association of State Election Directors' website and choose your state from the drop-down menu, she said.\n\nThose agencies, of course, need to work together. Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election prompted many local and state election officials to reexamine how they protect the voting process. Easterly recommended that Black Hat attendees sign up as poll workers, an \"on-the-ground\" approach to securing elections and understanding how votes are cast and counted."],"source":{"uri":["me.pcmag.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["PC Mag Middle East"]},"authors":[{"uri":["wrote_about_tech@me.pcmag.com"],"name":["Wrote About Tech"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]},{"uri":["did_field_producing@me.pcmag.com"],"name":["Did Field Producing"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]},{"uri":["worldwide_audiences_yes@me.pcmag.com"],"name":["Worldwide Audiences.

Tim Walz her running mate in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nHarris and Walz made their debut appearance as this year's full Democratic ticket Tuesday night at a rally in Philadelphia, less than three weeks after President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid. The Harris-Walz campaign also comes over a month after former President Donald Trump announced Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance as his running mate at the Republican National Convention in July.\n\nDemocratic and Republican political figures with Louisiana ties were quick to weigh in on Walz, who surfaced from a field of candidates that included Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly.\n\nRepublican politicians react\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry described the Harris-Walz campaign as \"the most radical left in American history,\" stating that their presidential partnership would lead to another four years of a \"crashing economy.\" Landry emphasized his support for the Trump-Vance campaign, adding that the two \"prioritize everyday Americans.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, of Benton, stressed his disapproval of Harris' take on immigration policies in a full statement on the social media platform X. He, too, cast Harris and Walz as \"radical left-wing\" candidates.\n\n\"I look forward to highlighting the vast differences between the most radical left-wing ticket in American history and the American First agenda that President Donald Trump and Senator J.D. Vance are fighting for everyday,\" Johnson said in a statement.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise, of Jefferson, said on X that Walz \"is a radical who let rioters burn Minneapolis to the ground in 2020 -- the same rioters Kamala Harris raised money to bail out. They're a dangerous duo that'll let crime destroy our communities.\"\n\nDemocratic politicians react\n\nRandal Gaines, chair of the Louisiana Democratic Party, said on Facebook that Louisiana officials could learn from Walz ability to govern, build coalitions and implement \"effective policies\" for all U.S. citizens. He also emphasized the importance of the vice president's role.\n\n\"It's never mattered more against the threats Donald Trump and J.D. Vance pose to our democracy and our future,\" Gaines said in the statement.\n\nFormer New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, a co-chair the Harris-Walz campaign, said Walz understands issues that affect working class.\n\n\"Tim Walz is the real deal,\" Landrieu said in another X post. \"Just a normal guy and such a contrast with the weird guys on the other side.\"\n\nDemocratic strategist James Carville, of New Orleans, said on CNN's \"The Lead with Jake Tapper\" that the more people know about Walz's life story, \"the better they will like him.\"\n\nCarville, who was the lead strategist for President Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign, said that Walz will play a pivotal role in winning the male vote. He told CNN that he doesn't think that Trump will debate or get \"within 50 miles\" of Walz.\n\nAt a campaign event Tuesday, Vance said that he \"absolutely\" wants to debate Walz at some point.\n\nA date for a presidential and vice presidential debate has not been set yet."],"source":{"uri":["theadvocate.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["The Advocate"]},"authors":[{"uri":["poet_wolfe@theadvocate.com"],"name":["Poet Wolfe"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/be/7be93391-94dd-56c0-9336-912b87885e5b/66b2aa0949ad4.image.jpg?crop=1762%2C925%2C0%2C125&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.0431],"wgt":[460755899],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8264113904"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["19:39:20"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T19:39:20Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T19:38:45Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.fox5ny.com/news/who-is-leading-polls-president-2024-presidential-polling-harris-trump-poll"],"title":["Who is leading the polls for president in 2024?"],"body":["WASHINGTON - With just 90 days to go until the 2024 presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris announced who would be running on the ticket with her.\n\nSpeculation about who she would choose began within days of President Joe Biden's announcement that he would not be running again and his endorsement of Harris and that came with a spate of polls considering who would best bolster Harris' chances against former President Donald Trump.\n\nHarris selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to join the ticket. The governor was relatively unknown before Tuesday but his history, experience and record are now being scrutinized as voters and pollsters attempt to determine how this decision will impact the race.\n\nHere's a closer look at how voters are feeling amid this unusual and rapidly shifting race for the White House.\n\nGenerally, Harris has been rising in the polls since it was announced that she would be running and became the Democratic party's presumptive nominee -- although she's only beating the former president out by a small margin so far.\n\nThe smallest margins are seen in the latest CBS News and New York Times polls.\n\nCBS shows Harris leading Trump but one point nationally. The poll was released Sunday and suggests that Harris' boost is due in part to younger and Black voters, who appear to be more engaged and therefore more likely to vote, and by women who believe Harris will favor their interests.\n\nThe New York Times also puts Harris one point ahead of Trump, noting significant improvement from when her candidacy was hypothetical to when she secured enough delegates to become the party's presumptive nominee. Harris will officially be confirmed as the nominee at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which could bring a further jump for the vice president.\n\nThe latest Morning Consult poll released Monday hows that Harris is steadily extending her lead. Their numbers show Harris leading Trump 48% to 44% with 5% of registered voters saying they would vote for \"someone else\" and 4% saying they don't know. It's the third consecutive week that the poll has shown Harris ahead of Trump.\n\nAccording to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist National Poll, Harris leads Trump by 3 percentage points with 51% of the vote compared to Trump's 48%. Two percent of respondents remain undecided. The gap widens among independent voters with 53% saying they would vote for Harris and 44% saying they would vote for Trump. Among those independents, 3% are undecided.\n\nTrump isn't down in all the polls though. He was leading Harris in the July Harvard CAPS-Harris poll by four points -- 52% to 48%. A Wall Street Journal poll published shortly after Biden dropped out showed the former president was beating Harris 49% to 47%, though they noted that Harris' entry into the race effectively ended the solid lead Trump had over Biden amid the serious age concerns troubling young voters.\n\nIn a poll generated by RealClearPolitics, which averages the latest data from 11 major polling sites, Harris leads Trump by a 0.5% margin. That small lead is exemplified by data that shows while she has an overall favorable outlook nationally, Harris and Trump face extremely tight races in battleground states including Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nIt's a bit early to see how adding Walz name to the ticket is going to impact the race. The governor was little-known outside of his home state ahead of the announcement and voters are still familiarizing themselves with his record.\n\nAt a rally Tuesday, Harris spoke to Walz's accolades, highlighting his progressive policies that led to legislation protecting women's reproductive rights, cutting taxes for the middle class, expanding paid leave for workers and establishing free school meal programs statewide.\n\nBut according to another NPR/PBS News/Marist National survey published Tuesday, nearly three-fourths of registered voters said they didn't know enough about Walz to have either a favorable or unfavorable impression of him. Just 17% of those surveyed said they viewed Walz positively and 12% said they had an unfavorable view of him.\n\nOverall, Walz favored lower than others who made the shortlist of contenders for the vice presidential nomination. Mark Kelly and Josh Shapiro were better known and more popular than Walz.\n\nIt's yet to be seen how voters react to Walz but his folksy, Midwestern roots and past professions as both a high school teacher and football coach, and a military veteran are seen as overwhelmingly favorable traits. It could be the key to boosting Harris' chances at the White House.\n\nWalz is also an outspoken gun owner but believes in stricter regulation -- a middle-of-the-road approach to a contentious issue that could attract moderate voters.\n\nSupport for 60-year-old Walz appears to be growing on social media, particularly with a viral clip of the governor starting the Harris campaign's \"weird\" attack line against former President Donald Trump and JD Vance.\n\n\"These are weird people on the other side. They want to take books away. They want to be in your exam room,\" Walz said in a TV interview last month.\n\nThe line took off among young voters -- a key demographic Democrats continue to rely upon to boost poll numbers."],"source":{"uri":["fox5ny.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["FOX 5 New York"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox5dc.com/www.fox5dc.com/content/uploads/2024/07/1280/720/Kamala-Harris-Donald-Trump.png?ve=1&tl=1"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.1608],"wgt":[460755560],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8264111322"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["19:37:15"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T19:37:15Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T19:36:11Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/24/08/40231026/taylor-swift-photo-sparks-kamala-harris-endorsement-speculation-what-fans-voters-should-kno"],"title":["Taylor Swift Photo Sparks Kamala Harris Endorsement Speculation: What Fans, Voters Should Know"],"body":["Speculation has begun that Swift will endorse Harris, but internet sleuths say \"you need to calm down.\"\n\nMusician and global superstar Taylor Swift is one of the most followed artists and her endorsement of a presidential candidate could shake things up for the 2024 presidential election.\n\nA new photo shared by Swift has sparked speculation that an endorsement could have happened or to be announced soon.\n\nWhat Happened: Vice President Kamala Harris has surged higher in 2024 election polls ahead of her head-to-head battle with Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nHarris has landed key endorsements from politicians, business leaders and celebrities.\n\nA photo shared by Swift on Instagram has sparked speculation that the singer is backing Harris in the 2024 election.\n\n\"Oh I loved those Warsaw shows SO much!!!

She previously endorsed Joe Biden and Harris in the 2020 election.\n\nPresidential candidate Donald Trump argued earlier this year that Swift should not endorse Biden.\n\n\"Why would she endorse this dope,\" Trump said, referring to Biden at the time. \"He doesn't know how to get off a stage.\"\n\nTrump argued that Swift would have more of a reason to support him after he signed the Music Modernization Act that helped musicians.\n\nPreviously, Trump supporters attacked Swift and started rumors alleging that the singer was in a conspiracy with the NFL and would endorse Biden.\n\nA February Morning Consult survey of registered voters showed that many Swift fans might not vote in the 2024 election. The survey found that of the Swift fans polled aged 18 to 34, only 51% said they would definitely vote in the 2024 election. A majority (54%) of the Swift fans polled who participated in the 2020 election voted for Biden, compared to 25% who voted for Trump.\n\nSwift encouraged fans to vote back in 2023 making a non-partisan post for voters to register on National Registration Day. The post led to Vote.org seeing a 1,226% jump in visits in the hour after Swift's Instagram story was posted.\n\nThe voter registration organization said the day saw the largest amount of people registering in three years, with the number of 18-year-old voters doubling from the previous year, potentially boosted by Swift's encouragement.\n\nHarris attracted a large amount of young voters according to a recent Morning Consult poll. In the poll, Harris had a four-point lead over Trump among all voters.

Tim Walz her running mate in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nHarris and Walz made their debut appearance as this year's full Democratic ticket Tuesday night at a rally in Philadelphia, less than three weeks after President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid. The Harris-Walz campaign also comes over a month after former President Donald Trump announced Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance as his running mate at the Republican National Convention in July.\n\nDemocratic and Republican political figures with Louisiana ties were quick to weigh in on Walz, who surfaced from a field of candidates that included Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly.\n\nRepublican politicians react\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry described the Harris-Walz campaign as \"the most radical left in American history,\" stating that their presidential partnership would lead to another four years of a \"crashing economy.\" Landry emphasized his support for the Trump-Vance campaign, adding that the two \"prioritize everyday Americans.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, of Benton, stressed his disapproval of Harris' take on immigration policies in a full statement on the social media platform X. He, too, cast Harris and Walz as \"radical left-wing\" candidates.\n\n\"I look forward to highlighting the vast differences between the most radical left-wing ticket in American history and the American First agenda that President Donald Trump and Senator J.D. Vance are fighting for everyday,\" Johnson said in a statement.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise, of Jefferson, said on X that Walz \"is a radical who let rioters burn Minneapolis to the ground in 2020 -- the same rioters Kamala Harris raised money to bail out. They're a dangerous duo that'll let crime destroy our communities.\"\n\nDemocratic politicians react\n\nRandal Gaines, chair of the Louisiana Democratic Party, said on Facebook that Louisiana officials could learn from Walz ability to govern, build coalitions and implement \"effective policies\" for all U.S. citizens. He also emphasized the importance of the vice president's role.\n\n\"It's never mattered more against the threats Donald Trump and J.D. Vance pose to our democracy and our future,\" Gaines said in the statement.\n\nFormer New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, a co-chair the Harris-Walz campaign, said Walz understands issues that affect working class.\n\n\"Tim Walz is the real deal,\" Landrieu said in another X post. \"Just a normal guy and such a contrast with the weird guys on the other side.\"\n\nDemocratic strategist James Carville, of New Orleans, said on CNN's \"The Lead with Jake Tapper\" that the more people know about Walz's life story, \"the better they will like him.\"\n\nCarville, who was the lead strategist for President Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign, said that Walz will play a pivotal role in winning the male vote. He told CNN that he doesn't think that Trump will debate or get \"within 50 miles\" of Walz.\n\nAt a campaign event Tuesday, Vance said that he \"absolutely\" wants to debate Walz at some point.\n\nA date for a presidential and vice presidential debate has not been set yet."],"source":{"uri":["nola.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["NOLA"]},"authors":[{"uri":["poet_wolfe@nola.com"],"name":["Poet Wolfe"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/94/b946ecdd-a608-54d4-b7b6-319adba82725/66b2a9f950121.image.jpg?crop=1762%2C925%2C0%2C125&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize"],"eventUri":["eng-9795783"],"sentiment":[0.0431],"wgt":[460755324],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["2024-08-447310621"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["19:35:02"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T19:35:02Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T19:34:47Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.pcmag.com/articles/us-cybersecurity-chief-dont-get-your-election-info-from-influencers"],"title":["US Cybersecurity Chief: Don't Get Your Election Info From Influencers"],"body":["LAS VEGAS -- Black Hat 2024 started off with warnings about election security tinged with optimism about the future of democracy around the world. This year's big question is, \"What can the cybersecurity community do to ensure safe and secure elections?\" After all, some 50 elections, including the US presidential election, are set to happen in 2024.\n\n\"Elections are complicated,\" Jen Easterly, director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), said on a panel of US and EU cybersecurity experts. \"I can guarantee that things will go wrong. The good news is: These types of events are disruptive, but they won't invalidate the votes cast.\"\n\nEasterly stressed that the best way to protect democracy is to ignore or invalidate attempts to spread disinformation and misinformation about elections or election results. \"Identify the signal through the noise,\" she said, warning that there will be attempts to spread lies or half-truths in the lead-up to and after the 2024 presidential election.\n\nFelicity Oswald, CEO of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), had a similar warning. AI-generated memes are fun, but they can also be used to spread false information and influence people around high-profile elections, she said.\n\nEasterly urged people to get information from local, state, and federal officials, not social media influencers, media outlets, or politicians. If you're in the US, visit the National Association of State Election Directors' website and choose your state from the drop-down menu, she said.\n\nThose agencies, of course, need to work together. Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election prompted many local and state election officials to reexamine how they protect the voting process. Easterly recommended that Black Hat attendees sign up as poll workers, an \"on-the-ground\" approach to securing elections and understanding how votes are cast and counted."],"source":{"uri":["pcmag.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["PC Magazine"]},"authors":[{"uri":["kim_key@pcmag.com"],"name":["Kim Key"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/041RJ5mw24Moa2LYPll44h5-1.fit_lim.size_1200x630.v1723056356.jpg"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.1137],"wgt":[460755302],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8264104358"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["19:30:26"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T19:30:26Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T19:29:06Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://roanoke.com/life-entertainment/nation-world/movies-tv/disney-hikes-price-for-disney-hulu-and-espn-subscription-services/article_7c05b626-1a20-57a5-88f7-a80a11480556.html"],"title":["Disney hikes price for Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ subscription services"],"body":["TheStreet's Conway Gittens brings you the biggest news of the day, including what investors are watching and why Disney is hiking the price of all of its streaming services.\n\nDisney's streaming services are about to get more expensive.\n\nOn Tuesday, the media company announced price hikes across the board for Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+.

Notably, the three Republicans on the election board had received accolades from former President Donald Trump only days earlier when he name-dropped them at a campaign rally at Georgia State University.\n\n\"They're on fire. They're doing a great job, three members: Janice Johnston, Rick Jeffares and Janelle King,\" the 34-count convicted felon and nominee for the 2024 GOP presidential ticket said, according to the newspaper. \"Three people are all pit bulls fighting for honesty, transparency and victory.\"\n\nThe new rule will officially take effect in 20 days but it can be challenged in court.\n\nRepublican state election board member Janice Johnston said after the vote that if elections are \"conducted fairly and legally and accurately, most of the time, they are certified.\"\n\n\"So it's not the end of the world,\" she said of the rule, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \"We're not asking the board to do a full election audit or a forensic audit. We're just asking for a reasonable inquiry.\"\n\nThe votes against the policy came from the body's sole Democrat, Sara Tindall Ghazal, and John Fervier, a Republican who crossed the aisle to join her. Notably, he was only recently appointed to the Georgia State Election Board by Gov. Brian Kemp, also a Republican.\n\nDemocrats and voting rights advocates argue that the policy is ill-defined and unnecessary since the state has not historically had issue certifying its votes until the recent meritless voter fraud claims brought by Republicans in 2020 and a resurgence again during primaries when local Republican election board members refused to certify votes while citing minor voting machine errors. More recently, the America First Policy Institute, a pro-Trump organization staffed by former Trump White House officials, sued on behalf of Fulton County Elections Board member Julie Adams seeking a ruling that would give Adams the right not to certify an election.\n\nCurrent laws make Adams' role on the election board ministerial. Ultimately, Adams, who was appointed to the Fulton County Election board in February, ended up abstaining when it came to certifying Georgia's recent primary election. Adams is a member of the Election Integrity Network, a group founded by Trump ally Cleta Mitchell. Mitchell, an attorney and onetime adviser to Trump's 2016 campaign, was on the call Trump had with Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger when Trump asked him to \"find\" 11,780 votes so he could be declared victor.\n\nAs Law&Crime reported, Mitchell left her law firm after the call was leaked.\n\nToday, Georgia Democrats, like the state's House Minority Whip Sam Park, argue the policy is \"egregious\" and fear it will trigger a wave of litigation not dissimilar from what unfolded in the state in 2020 when pro-Trump elector and attorney Lin Wood sued to block the certification results.\n\nAt a press conference after the vote, Park stressed that the new policy would give local election officials the ability to slow down or flat out refuse results merely by stating that they think there is a discrepancy but not offering much more than that.\n\nThis means election board officials will now perform their duties as if they are discretionary, not mandatory, he said.\n\nAnd this, the legislator underlined, conflicts with state law.\n\nThe alleged vagueness of the word \"reasonable\" in \"reasonable inquiry\" also gave pause to governmental watchdog groups like Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\n\nOne attorney for the group, Nikhel Sus, reportedly reminded election board members on Tuesday that the language they approved would apply to all 159 counties and that made little sense given that \"the word 'reasonable' is inherently subjective.\"\n\n\"What's reasonable to board members in one county may not be reasonable to members in another county,\" Sus said. \"This sort of open-ended language invites arbitrary and patchwork decision-making across counties.\"\n\nThe rule is the brainchild of Michael Heekin, a Republican-appointed member of the Fulton County Election board. He first introduced it in May.\n\n\"This is not a ministerial act where I take out a stamp and say, 'It's hereby certified.' There's a higher order of mental processes that go on in this. If we go forward on this, I won't get any more nasty letters from lawyers threatening to put me in jail,\" Heekin said at a meeting of the state's election board this spring, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nHeekin also opposed certifying election results declaring Joe Biden the winner in Georgia in 2020.\n\nFervier, the Republican who sided with the election board's sole Democrat, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution he was \"sympathetic\" to the idea of being able to review voting materials before certification but there needed to be \"guardrails\" in place.\n\nYet, he said, \"there don't appear to be any guardrails around that process.\"\n\nKing, a Republican, said she was for it because if she was \"going to ask a county election worker to sign their name on a legal document saying this is in accurate, when in fact, they may see that there's some discrepancies, then we're setting them up for failure.\"\n\nMemorably, as Law&Crime reported, it was Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani who admitted that he made up claims of voter fraud in Georgia and specifically those accusations involving the election workers he defamed Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss. Giuliani nonetheless defended his claims as protected under his First Amendment right to free speech. He filed for bankruptcy in New York after he was ordered to pay a $148 million defamation judgment to the women in December.

The Democratic and Republican presidential nominees have a lot of plans for tax cuts and government giveaways, customized to please each candidate's desired constituencies.\n\nBoth candidates, however, are whistling past America's biggest economic challenge: A gargantuan national debt that is going to hamstring the flexibility of future presidents like never before. In the worst outcome, a debt crisis could trigger a nasty recession and years of punishing fiscal austerity that will drive voters to new levels of vexation.\n\nThe national debt recently hit a new record high of $35 trillion, and it's only going to keep growing. Debt scolds have been warning about unsustainable levels of US debt for 30 years, and many predictions of a debt crisis haven't come to pass.\n\nBut the United States is now in unprecedented territory for any government, ever, and financial markets have begun flinching at all the debt the US Treasury is issuing. Some analysts think the debt crisis has already begun.\n\nIn a recent episode of the Yahoo Finance Capitol Gains podcast above -- see the 13:30 mark -- debt expert Brian Riedl of the Manhattan Institute summarized what the nation needs to do to get the debt under control and forestall a crisis. Riedl recently wrote a 43-page report on the problem, which Yahoo Finance explained in a July 9 story.\n\nThe good news is that the United States doesn't need to pay off the entire national debt -- far from it. If we can stabilize the debt at current levels, which means sharply reducing annual deficits, it would put the nation on much sounder footing and probably be sustainable indefinitely, barring dramatic unforeseen developments such as a large war.\n\nWhile the total national debt is $35 trillion, about $7 trillion of that is special securities held by the government in accounts such as the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. The amount that matters to markets is federal debt held by the public, which is all securities sold to investors by the Treasury Dept. That totals about $28 trillion, which is roughly the size of the US economy. So, federal debt held by the public equals about 100% of GDP.\n\nThe goal is to keep debt levels no higher than 100% of GDP. Alas, that's not going to happen unless there's dramatic change. Social Security and Medicare are both paying out more than they're taking in, and that will only get worse as more Americans enter those programs. Net interest payments are rising sharply because interest rates have risen and the total amount of debt the government is financing has risen too. Other portions of the federal budget are simply underfunded.\n\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office sees publicly held federal debt rising from 100% of GDP now to 122% within 10 years and only going up from there. The CBO doesn't forecast recessions, so that doesn't include any chance of a downturn during the next decade that would require fiscal stimulus, which always adds to deficits and makes the federal debt even bigger.\n\nIn Riedl's analysis, closing the federal revenue-spending gap will require about $10 trillion of savings during the next decade. That could come in the form of budget cuts or new taxes, or a combination of both. But the scale of such an effort needs to be massive. Trimming a few programs or instituting new taxes on their own won't come close to solving the problem.\n\nWhat would solve the problem are changes to Social Security and Medicare cutting benefits for wealthier enrollees and raising the eligibility age. Medicare would have to be restructured to become more efficient. All that could be done while safeguarding benefits for lower-income seniors, who rely most on these safety net programs. Any such changes would doubtless be unpopular, yet far better than what would happen if the programs ran short of money and the only options were to cut benefits across the board.\n\nNeither presidential candidate, needless to say, is campaigning on the vote-losing promise of cutting retiree benefits for some in order to sustain some benefits for all. More than that, each candidate is proposing tax cuts and deficit-funded policies that will make the whole problem worse, not better.\n\nThe biggest budget battle looming during the next two years is what to do about the 2017 Trump tax cuts for individuals, which expire at the end of 2025. Trump and his fellow Republicans want to keep all the 2017 tax cuts in place, while perhaps cutting the business tax a bit from its current 21% level. Trump also wants to eliminate taxes on income derived from tips and get rid of income taxes on Social Security benefits. All told, that would add about $6 trillion to the national debt.\n\nHarris, like President Joe Biden when he was the Democrats' 2024 presidential candidate, wants to let the 2017 tax cuts expire for those earning more than $400,000 but keep them in place for everybody else. Democrats also want to eliminate the cap on state and local tax deductions, which was part of the 2017 tax law, while also boosting tax credits for working parents and lower-income households. Her plan would add about $5 trillion to the national debt.\n\nBoth candidates, in other words, are going the wrong direction, if stabilizing the debt is the priority. \"The reality is, 10 trillion is hard enough,\" Riedl told Yahoo Finance on the Capitol Gains podcast. \"Harris and Trump are probably going to push it up to 15 or 16 trillion right away.\"\n\nBoth candidates, meanwhile, say they'll protect Social Security and Medicare, with no changes to benefits. That \"makes it mathematically impossible to stabilize the debt,\" Rield says.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., everybody knows what it will take to finally do something to get the debt under control: a crisis that makes it apparent to everybody that something needs to be done and there's no other choice. That's the least competent and most expensive way to deal with the problem -- but voters themselves probably wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nNo politician can get elected by vowing to reform retiree programs -- remember when President George W. Bush tried to reform Social Security back in the day? That's especially true now that mass disinformation allows cranks and scaremongers to transmogrify any reasonable-sounding plan into Armageddon.\n\nMany voters say they're worried about the imposing size of the national debt, but most people want somebody else to pay to fix it. The inevitable result is that we'll all end up paying, and it will be a lot more than necessary.\n\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

We had to take a break, but I love the D,\" he said at the Borderlands premiere in Los Angeles. \"Everybody takes a break sometimes. We'll be back.\"\n\nSpeaking to Variety on the red carpet as well, Black confirmed that he and Gass, 64 -- who made up the musical duo -- are still \"friends\" following the latter's Trump comment. \"That hasn't changed,\" he added. \"These things take time sometimes... And we'll be back when it feels right.\"\n\nBlack addressed Tenacious D's fate via Instagram on July 16, revealing that he felt \"blindsided\" by what Gass said about the former president at one of their shows in Sydney that month. According to fan-recorded footage shared on X (formerly Twitter), Gass joked about the July assassination attempt against Trump, saying his 64th birthday \"wish\" would be \"don't miss Trump next time.\"\n\nIn his Instagram post, Black wrote, \"I would never condone hate speech or encourage political violence in any form. After much reflection, I no longer feel it is appropriate to continue the Tenacious D tour, and all future creative plans are on hold.\"\n\nHe added, \"I am grateful to fans for their support and understanding.\"\n\nIn a now-deleted Instagram post, Gass apologized for his joke, saying, \"The line I improvised onstage Sunday night in Sydney was highly inappropriate, dangerous and a terrible mistake.\"\n\n\"I don't condone violence of any kind, in any form, against anyone,\" he continued. \"What happened was a tragedy, and I'm incredible [sic] sorry for my severe lack of judgment. I profoundly apologize to those I've let down and truly regret any pain I've caused.\"\n\nPrior to the incident, Black and Gass planned a short fall tour benefitting Rock the Vote, marking their second time teaming up with the nonpartisan nonprofit, per Rolling Stone. The longtime duo -- who have been friends for nearly 40 years and formed their band in 1994 -- had five shows scheduled in October in states like Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania leading up to the 2024 presidential election on Nov. 5."],"source":{"uri":["people.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["PEOPLE.com"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://people.com/thmb/y_5bIjud5CkFKhYyPtdbWFJTr2I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(711x265:713x267)/jack-black-tour-canceled-with-kyle-gass-080724-6854c27bd90c421c89d8f4eb6342c111.jpg"],"eventUri":["eng-9796871"],"sentiment":[0.1843],"wgt":[460754344],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["2024-08-447297962"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["19:17:58"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T19:17:58Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T19:04:00Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.mor-tv.com/article/pelosi-new-book/61798273"],"title":["Pelosi warns in her new book that political threats and violence 'must stop'"],"body":["Nancy Pelosi thought briefly she might have died on Jan. 6, 2021.Not quite two years later, the threat of political violence would come for her husband at their home.\"Where's Nancy?

Tim Walz to join the ticket. The governor was relatively unknown before Tuesday but his history, experience and record are now being scrutinized as voters and pollsters attempt to determine how this decision will impact the race.\n\nHere's a closer look at how voters are feeling amid this unusual and rapidly shifting race for the White House.\n\nGenerally, Harris has been rising in the polls since it was announced that she would be running and became the Democratic party's presumptive nominee -- although she's only beating the former president out by a small margin so far.\n\nThe smallest margins are seen in the latest CBS News and New York Times polls.\n\nCBS shows Harris leading Trump but one point nationally. The poll was released Sunday and suggests that Harris' boost is due in part to younger and Black voters, who appear to be more engaged and therefore more likely to vote, and by women who believe Harris will favor their interests.\n\nThe New York Times also puts Harris one point ahead of Trump, noting significant improvement from when her candidacy was hypothetical to when she secured enough delegates to become the party's presumptive nominee. Harris will officially be confirmed as the nominee at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which could bring a further jump for the vice president.\n\nThe latest Morning Consult poll released Monday hows that Harris is steadily extending her lead. Their numbers show Harris leading Trump 48% to 44% with 5% of registered voters saying they would vote for \"someone else\" and 4% saying they don't know. It's the third consecutive week that the poll has shown Harris ahead of Trump.\n\nAccording to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist National Poll, Harris leads Trump by 3 percentage points with 51% of the vote compared to Trump's 48%. Two percent of respondents remain undecided. The gap widens among independent voters with 53% saying they would vote for Harris and 44% saying they would vote for Trump. Among those independents, 3% are undecided.\n\nTrump isn't down in all the polls though. He was leading Harris in the July Harvard CAPS-Harris poll by four points -- 52% to 48%. A Wall Street Journal poll published shortly after Biden dropped out showed the former president was beating Harris 49% to 47%, though they noted that Harris' entry into the race effectively ended the solid lead Trump had over Biden amid the serious age concerns troubling young voters.\n\nIn a poll generated by RealClearPolitics, which averages the latest data from 11 major polling sites, Harris leads Trump by a 0.5% margin. That small lead is exemplified by data that shows while she has an overall favorable outlook nationally, Harris and Trump face extremely tight races in battleground states including Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nIt's a bit early to see how adding Walz name to the ticket is going to impact the race. The governor was little-known outside of his home state ahead of the announcement and voters are still familiarizing themselves with his record.\n\nAt a rally Tuesday, Harris spoke to Walz's accolades, highlighting his progressive policies that led to legislation protecting women's reproductive rights, cutting taxes for the middle class, expanding paid leave for workers and establishing free school meal programs statewide.\n\nBut according to another NPR/PBS News/Marist National survey published Tuesday, nearly three-fourths of registered voters said they didn't know enough about Walz to have either a favorable or unfavorable impression of him. Just 17% of those surveyed said they viewed Walz positively and 12% said they had an unfavorable view of him.\n\nOverall, Walz favored lower than others who made the shortlist of contenders for the vice presidential nomination. Mark Kelly and Josh Shapiro were better known and more popular than Walz.\n\nIt's yet to be seen how voters react to Walz but his folksy, Midwestern roots and past professions as both a high school teacher and football coach, and a military veteran are seen as overwhelmingly favorable traits. It could be the key to boosting Harris' chances at the White House.\n\nWalz is also an outspoken gun owner but believes in stricter regulation -- a middle-of-the-road approach to a contentious issue that could attract moderate voters.\n\nSupport for 60-year-old Walz appears to be growing on social media, particularly with a viral clip of the governor starting the Harris campaign's \"weird\" attack line against former President Donald Trump and JD Vance.\n\n\"These are weird people on the other side. They want to take books away. They want to be in your exam room,\" Walz said in a TV interview last month.\n\nThe line took off among young voters -- a key demographic Democrats continue to rely upon to boost poll numbers."],"source":{"uri":["fox5dc.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["FOX 5 DC"]},"authors":[{"uri":["jillian_smith@fox5dc.com"],"name":["Jillian Smith"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox5dc.com/www.fox5dc.com/content/uploads/2024/07/1280/720/Kamala-Harris-Donald-Trump.png?ve=1&tl=1"],"eventUri":["eng-9792426"],"sentiment":[0.1608],"wgt":[460754045],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["2024-08-447294615"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["19:13:57"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T19:13:57Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T19:04:00Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.kcra.com/article/pelosi-new-book/61798273"],"title":["Pelosi warns in her new book that political threats and violence 'must stop'"],"body":["Nancy Pelosi thought briefly she might have died on Jan. 6, 2021.Not quite two years later, the threat of political violence would come for her husband at their home.\"Where's Nancy?

It comes in a deeply uncertain environment for media companies, which face rapidly changing consumer behavior, rising costs of doing business, a revitalized labor movement in Hollywood and harsh regulators that are skeptical of mergers.\n\nNetflix remains the runaway leader in the streaming business - and the only consistently profitable competitor in the segment. Disney is the closest to building a semblance of a Netflix rival, barely squeezing out a profit in parts of its streaming business in the first quarter.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nBeginning on October 17, U.S. subscribers to Disney+ will have to pay $2 more per month for its plans: Disney+ with ads will cost $9.99, up from $7.99. Its ad-free plan will cost $15.99, up from $13.99.\n\nPeople are also reading...

ESPN+, the company's sports streaming service, will also rise by $1 to $11.99 per month.\n\nThe company said it would also add new features to Disney+, along with the price hikes: Ahead of the 2024 Presidential Election, all Disney+ subscribers will have access to ABC News Live and a continuous playlist of content aimed at preschool-aged children.\n\nThe company also hiked the price of its subscription services by several dollars last year in an effort to make its streaming services profitable. Disney has steadily raised the prices of its streaming offerings since its flagship service, Disney+, launched nearly five years ago with a relatively low monthly subscription fee of $6.99.\n\nDisney's direct-to-consumer business, which includes its streaming services Disney+ and Hulu, long a money-losing endeavor for the company, eked out its first profit in May. The company reports its third-quarter results on Wednesday.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

It comes in a deeply uncertain environment for media companies, which face rapidly changing consumer behavior, rising costs of doing business, a revitalized labor movement in Hollywood and harsh regulators that are skeptical of mergers.\n\nNetflix remains the runaway leader in the streaming business - and the only consistently profitable competitor in the segment. Disney is the closest to building a semblance of a Netflix rival, barely squeezing out a profit in parts of its streaming business in the first quarter.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nBeginning on October 17, U.S. subscribers to Disney+ will have to pay $2 more per month for its plans: Disney+ with ads will cost $9.99, up from $7.99. Its ad-free plan will cost $15.99, up from $13.99.\n\nHulu's ad-supported plan will also increase to $9.99 per month, from $7.99, and its ad-free plan will rise by one dollar to $18.99. ESPN+, the company's sports streaming service, will also rise by $1 to $11.99 per month.\n\nThe company said it would also add new features to Disney+, along with the price hikes: Ahead of the 2024 Presidential Election, all Disney+ subscribers will have access to ABC News Live and a continuous playlist of content aimed at preschool-aged children.\n\nThe company also hiked the price of its subscription services by several dollars last year in an effort to make its streaming services profitable. Disney has steadily raised the prices of its streaming offerings since its flagship service, Disney+, launched nearly five years ago with a relatively low monthly subscription fee of $6.99.\n\nDisney's direct-to-consumer business, which includes its streaming services Disney+ and Hulu, long a money-losing endeavor for the company, eked out its first profit in May. The company reports its third-quarter results on Wednesday."],"source":{"uri":["muscatinejournal.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Muscatine Journal"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/muscatinejournal.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/c8/8c81945c-5f4f-5180-93a8-fbc36b3bcc79/66b3abd9b2310.preview.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.0275],"wgt":[460753822],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["2024-08-447290822"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["19:09:38"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T19:09:38Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T19:04:00Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.wpbf.com/article/pelosi-new-book/61798273"],"title":["Pelosi warns in her new book that political threats and violence 'must stop'"],"body":["Nancy Pelosi thought briefly she might have died on Jan. 6, 2021.Not quite two years later, the threat of political violence would come for her husband at their home.\"Where's Nancy?

And we'll be back when it feels right.\"\n\nBlack addressed Tenacious D's fate via Instagram on July 16, revealing that he felt \"blindsided\" by what Gass said about the former president at one of their shows in Sydney that month. According to fan-recorded footage shared on X (formerly Twitter), Gass joked about the July assassination attempt against Trump, saying his 64th birthday \"wish\" would be \"don't miss Trump next time.\"\n\nIn his Instagram post, Black wrote, \"I would never condone hate speech or encourage political violence in any form.

It comes in a deeply uncertain environment for media companies, which face rapidly changing consumer behavior, rising costs of doing business, a revitalized labor movement in Hollywood and harsh regulators that are skeptical of mergers.\n\nNetflix remains the runaway leader in the streaming business - and the only consistently profitable competitor in the segment. Disney is the closest to building a semblance of a Netflix rival, barely squeezing out a profit in parts of its streaming business in the first quarter.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nBeginning on October 17, U.S. subscribers to Disney+ will have to pay $2 more per month for its plans: Disney+ with ads will cost $9.99, up from $7.99. Its ad-free plan will cost $15.99, up from $13.99.\n\nPeople are also reading...

ESPN+, the company's sports streaming service, will also rise by $1 to $11.99 per month.\n\nThe company said it would also add new features to Disney+, along with the price hikes: Ahead of the 2024 Presidential Election, all Disney+ subscribers will have access to ABC News Live and a continuous playlist of content aimed at preschool-aged children.\n\nThe company also hiked the price of its subscription services by several dollars last year in an effort to make its streaming services profitable. Disney has steadily raised the prices of its streaming offerings since its flagship service, Disney+, launched nearly five years ago with a relatively low monthly subscription fee of $6.99.\n\nDisney's direct-to-consumer business, which includes its streaming services Disney+ and Hulu, long a money-losing endeavor for the company, eked out its first profit in May. The company reports its third-quarter results on Wednesday.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

We had to take a break, but I love the D,\" he said at the Borderlands premiere in Los Angeles. \"Everybody takes a break sometimes. We'll be back.\"\n\nRelated: Jack Black Cancels Tenacious D Tour as Bandmate Kyle Gass Apologizes for 'Inappropriate' Trump Joke\n\nSpeaking to Variety on the red carpet as well, Black confirmed that he and Gass, 64 -- who made up the musical duo -- are still \"friends\" following the latter's Trump comment. \"That hasn't changed,\" he added. \"These things take time sometimes... And we'll be back when it feels right.\"\n\nBlack addressed Tenacious D's fate via Instagram on July 16, revealing that he felt \"blindsided\" by what Gass said about the former president at one of their shows in Sydney that month. According to fan-recorded footage shared on X (formerly Twitter), Gass joked about the July assassination attempt against Trump, saying his 64th birthday \"wish\" would be \"don't miss Trump next time.\"\n\nIn his Instagram post, Black wrote, \"I would never condone hate speech or encourage political violence in any form.

After gloating about his past movie roles, he said \"You can trust me,\" before expressing how excited he is about the first U.S. woman president.\n\n'Vice President Kamala can win this thing if we all rally around and really take advantage of this incredible energy that's happening,\" the 58-year-old stated before noting he wants a president who doesn't lie and that values democracy over themselves.\n\n\"It's going to be the first woman president and that's incredibly exciting. She's Indian, she's Black, she's everything. You can be more than one thing, it's incredible,\" Stiller stated on the Comics for Kamala Zoom video conference on Aug. 5.\n\nThe Primetime Emmy Award winner also added, \"I'm Jewish and Irish. I wish I was Black, every white Jewish guy wishes he was Black.\"\n\nStiller's comments about \"white Jewish\" men wanting to be Black received negative reactions online. X users slammed the Hollywood insider from multiple angles.\n\nOne person asked, \"What kind of bs pandering is this,\" while another person said, \"Lying...you don't wish you was black at all Foh now y'all just tryna say what you think we want to hear.\"\n\nEven Stiller's non-Black counterparts took issue, with one X user suggesting, \"Alright. It's time for Ben to give up all his possessions and money to black people. It's only right.\"\n\nOther commenters suggested the \"Madagascar\" star was looking for clout because his acting career is on the decline. For example, a critic tweeted, \"He didn't have to say as many words to let everyone know he's washed up.\"\n\nAnother X user joked, \"I think Ben lost too many girlfriends to Black guys.\" Additionally, Stiller's possible attempt at humor got called out, \"I think he was trying to be funny, but it was so dry and lamely delivered, it wasn't funny.\"\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell of California organized the Comics for Kamala fundraising event. Whoopi Goldberg, Tiffany Haddish, D.L. Hughley, Kathy Griffin, John Stamos, Mark Hamill, Jon Hamm, and other celebrities were among the attendees.\n\nAccording to Entertainment Weekly, Comics for Kamala raised over $532,000 for the Harris campaign.\n\nPreviously, other groups such as Win with Black Women, Win with Black Men, Out for Kamala Harris, White Women: Answer the Call, and White Dudes for Harris held fundraising virtual rallies for the Democratic politician.\n\nX owner Elon Musk recently faced backlash after the social media platform reportedly suspended the White Dudes for Harris account. Musk is an outspoken advocate for Donald Trump and a donor to the Republican Party.\n\n\"We scared @elonmusk and @DonaldJTrumpJr so much tonight they suspended our account and won't let us back in. These guys are running scared of the success we've had tonight, but we're not going to quit,\" Mike Nellis, a founder of White Dudes For Harris, tweeted on July 29.\n\nThe @dudes4harris X page is currently active. Over the last 24 hours, White Dudes for Harris has been enthusiastically promoting the newly announced Kamala Harris-Tim Walz ticket.\n\nKamala Harris officially selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate on Aug. 6. The Democrats face off against former President Donald Trump and his vice-presidential pick, Ohio Senator JD Vance, in the 2024 presidential election."],"source":{"uri":["atlantablackstar.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Atlanta Black Star"]},"authors":[{"uri":["yohance_kyles@atlantablackstar.com"],"name":["Yohance Kyles"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ben-Stiller-Instagram.jpg"],"eventUri":["eng-9796902"],"sentiment":[0.4039],"wgt":[460753220],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8264068067"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["18:57:02"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T18:57:02Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T18:56:09Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.5725],"url":["https://statesville.com/life-entertainment/nation-world/movies-tv/disney-hikes-price-for-disney-hulu-and-espn-subscription-services/article_12dc40b5-9974-54a0-999e-7682342c3e57.html"],"title":["Disney hikes price for Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ subscription services"],"body":["TheStreet's Conway Gittens brings you the biggest news of the day, including what investors are watching and why Disney is hiking the price of all of its streaming services.\n\nDisney's streaming services are about to get more expensive.\n\nOn Tuesday, the media company announced price hikes across the board for Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+.

Vance, was shelved at a time when former President Donald Trump and his campaign have been trying to distance themselves from the project, which pushes a radical overhaul of the federal government that would give the president power to fire career civil servants and replace them with political loyalists.\n\nHowever, progressive media watchdog Media Matters for America has obtained a copy of the book and has found that it contains tirades against contraception, childless Americans, and even dog parks.\n\nWhen it comes to contraception, Roberts makes the case that it is at the root of much of what ails modern society.\n\nALSO READ: 21 worthless knick-knacks Donald Trump will give you for your cash\n\n\"We need to understand what could be called contraceptive technologies -- revolutionary inventions that shape American culture away from abundance, marriage, and family -- in the same vein,\" writes Roberts. \"They shift norms, incentives, and choices, often invisibly and involuntarily. Conservatives inveigh against no-fault divorce, the Sexual Revolution, and the destruction of a culture of hope without recognizing that these cultural changes are all downstream of technological ones.\"\n\nLater in the book, Roberts claims that contraception is directly responsible for the number of abortions American women have.\n\n\"As other kinds of contraceptive technologies spread, abortion rates went up, not down,\" he argues. \"Why? Because technological change made having a child seem like an optional and not natural result of having sex and destroyed a whole series of institutions and cultural norms that had protected women and forced men to take responsibility for their actions.\"\n\nRoberts sees signs of decay as a result of making having children optional -- including in the proliferation of dog parks, which he calls the result of \"antifamily culture shaping legislation, regulation, and enforcement throughout our sprawling government.\""],"source":{"uri":["rawstory.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Raw Story"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/kevin-roberts-president-of-the-far-right-heritage-foundation-tom-williams-cq-roll-call-inc-getty-images.jpg?id=52540759&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C66%2C0%2C67"],"eventUri":["eng-9798723"],"sentiment":[-0.0196],"wgt":[460752833],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8264061290"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["18:50:57"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T18:50:57Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T18:49:57Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.5882],"url":["https://magicvalley.com/life-entertainment/nation-world/movies-tv/disney-hikes-price-for-disney-hulu-and-espn-subscription-services/article_661b2f14-9d62-5333-b1f4-b51545832355.html"],"title":["Disney hikes price for Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ subscription services"],"body":["TheStreet's Conway Gittens brings you the biggest news of the day, including what investors are watching and why Disney is hiking the price of all of its streaming services.\n\nDisney's streaming services are about to get more expensive.\n\nOn Tuesday, the media company announced price hikes across the board for Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+.

Despite that excitement and what you'd think would be a friendly environment for Walz as he makes his national debut, he managed to draw some boos from the crowd.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, he also got a lot of cheers and even some laughs. That said, it wasn't all 100% positive feedback from the crowd.\n\nIn a politically friendly environment, you wouldn't think a candidate would get booed. While it was limited to one particular comment, Walz ended up making a comment that didn't land too well with the crowd.\n\nThe first thing to know is where the rally was held. Far from Walz's Minnesota home, he and Harris went to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for their first rally together. At this rally, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro offered opening remarks. Shapiro was also a finalist in the \"veepstakes\", with Walz ultimately beating him out for the role.\n\nWhile this might seem a little awkward, Shapiro had nice things to say about Walz, and Walz had nice things to say about Shapiro. Walz explained that he and Shapiro are friends, declaring how he's seen him just being a normal person while they went to a Bruce Springsteen concert together.\n\nIn the quick comment, Walz mentioned that the concert was in \"Jersey\", a rival location across state lines. The comment can be heard at the 1:22 mark in the video below. Initially, the crowd cheered, then a number of members in the crowd started to boo.\n\nNot everyone agrees that these boo-birds were actually disapproving of the comment. Someone on X suggested that perhaps they were saying \"Bruuuuuuuce\" in approval of Springsteen, and not booing.\n\nI don't know that I personally believe that, but it's hard to tell from seeing it on TV. At least he wasn't booed from the get-go being Governor of the state that is home to the Vikings deep in Eagles territory."],"source":{"uri":["mix108.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["MIX 108"]},"authors":[{"uri":["nick_cooper@mix108.com"],"name":["Nick Cooper"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://townsquare.media/site/164/files/2024/08/attachment-GettyImages-2165610255.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.2235],"wgt":[460752408],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8264056913"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["18:46:12"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T18:46:12Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T18:45:50Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/business/media/media-coverage-tim-walz.html"],"title":["'Fun Midwestern Dad' or 'Radical'?

Tim Walz, who complied with the organization's rules by resigning after chosen to be Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nKelly, who served as vice chair since December 2022, assumed the chair's position of the partisan organization dedicated to electing and reelecting Democratic candidates for governor.\n\n\"With reproductive freedom, democracy and voting rights on the line, the stakes couldn't be higher, and it's never been more important to elect Democratic governors,\" Kelly said.\n\nWalz stepped down Tuesday from the DGA post in accordance with bylaws that prohibit candidates for federal office to lead the organization.\n\nIn addition to the presidential election in November, 11 states conduct simultaneous gubernatorial elections.\n\n\"I know what it means to win tough races in a red state,\" Kelly said. \"The DGA was by my side for two tough fights in 2018 and 2022, and I'm glad to be by theirs as we sprint to the finish line to elect Democratic governors in key states across the country and build on the DGA's record of success this fall.\"\n\nIn 2022, Kelly won reelection against then-Attorney General Derek Schmidt. Four years prior, she beat then-Secretary of State Kris Kobach to move from the Kansas Senate to the governor's office. Republican Donald Trump, who endorsed Schmidt and Kobach in those gubernatorial races, carried Kansas in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections.\n\nKelly credited Walz with the DGA's fundraising success from January to June. Reports showed the organization raised $61 million in the period.\n\nMeghan Meehan-Draper, executive director of the association, said the DGA's objective during the final three months of the 2024 election cycle was to bring attention to issues of greatest concern to voters.\n\n\"By focusing on the issues that matter most to Kansans, Governor Kelly has shown what effective leadership looks like, and has been a huge asset to the DGA in her role as vice chair these last two years.
