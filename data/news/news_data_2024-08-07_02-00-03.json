Mobile ordering at Starbucks was down, as were certain online services from the UK government's courts and tribunals service and the Dutch football club FC Twente.\n\nMicrosoft 365, which includes popular applications like Outlook and Excel, was also impacted.\n\nTo make matters worse, an error in Microsoft's automated defence mechanism \"amplified\" the attack instead of mitigating it, the company said in a status update.\n\nDDoS attacks were once considered a \"solved problem,\" according to Boaz Gelbord, chief security officer at Akamai Technologies.\n\n\"Attackers could clog the pipes, and then providers could buy bigger pipes, and then they'd be safe from DDoS.\"\n\nBut today, they are cheaper and easier than ever and can even be purchased on the dark web for as little as $11 (R219), according to Akamai.\n\n\"One of the phenomena we've seen in recent years is DDoS attacks resurging,\" Gelbord said.\n\n\"They're a problem for small sites, but especially now for enterprise companies. It used to be the opposite.\"\n\nDDoS attacks, which have been around for decades, aim to flood web servers with so much traffic that they become virtually inaccessible to legitimate users.\n\nThe proliferation of internet-connected devices has helped intensify the attacks. Specialized malware is used to infect everything from smart TVs and fitness trackers to baby monitors and video cameras.\n\nThe malware weaves those infected devices into a single network known as a \"botnet,\" a zombie army that can be directed to overwhelm servers with millions of requests at once.\n\nAside from making political statements, DDoS attacks are sometimes part of broader extortion schemes in which hackers seek a payment to make them stop. It's not yet clear who was behind the Microsoft attacks.\n\nDDoS mitigation efforts often involve filtering out malicious traffic.\n\nHowever, requests from bots -- those zombie computers -- can look nearly identical to requests from real users, said Pavel Odintsov, chief technology officer of DDoS-mitigation company FastNetMon.\n\nOdintsov and five other DDoS experts told Bloomberg News that Microsoft likely exacerbated the impacts of Tuesday's attack by blocking out real Azure users in its attempt to isolate illegitimate ones.\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson said \"a network device misconfiguration\" contributed to the service interruption, but didn't provide further details.\n\nThe company is still investigating the Azure outage, which has now been fully resolved, the spokesperson said.\n\n\"When you have a hammer, everything is a nail,\" Odintsov said.\n\n\"It's quite easy to make a mistake and block real customers.\" Over the past four years, Odintsov said, the number of DDoS attacks his company has observed has approximately doubled each year.\n\nDDoS attacks are getting tougher to defend against, Gelbord said, because botnets are getting bigger and more accessible.\n\nWith an ever-increasing number of web-connected devices and gadgets, cybercriminals have more potential electronic devices to enlist as unwitting participants in their attacks.\n\n\"You have much more readily available botnet armies,\" Gelbord said. \"It's almost like an industry. You can rent them for hire, fairly inexpensively.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, known as CISA, jointly warned of potential DDoS attacks during the upcoming 2024 US presidential election.\n\nThe attacks have been used in the past to target election infrastructure, and the government agencies said they will likely be used again for the same purpose.\n\nIn Venezuela, DDoS attacks have spiked tenfold since President Nicolás Maduro declared victory in a disputed election, according to NetScout Systems Inc. Political demonstrations have erupted on the streets of Caracas to protest what some are calling a fraudulent win.\n\n\"It's not a specific hacktivist group, but a form of digital protest to real-world events,\" said Richard Hummel, a senior threat intelligence manager at NetScout. \"This is cyberactivity where adversaries are trying to effect chaos.\""],"source":{"uri":["mybroadband.co.za"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["MyBroadband"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Microsoft-800x450.jpg"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[-0.051],"wgt":[460706907],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8262923814"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["05:52:12"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T05:52:12Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T05:51:41Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.7098],"url":["http://www.hiiraan.com/news4/2024/aug/197426/fact_check_vp_pick_tim_walz_didn_t_change_minnesota_flag_to_somali_flag.aspx"],"title":["FACT CHECK: VP pick Tim Walz didn't change Minnesota flag to Somali flag"],"body":["Wednesday August 7, 2024\n\nWalz greets Kamala Harris in St. Paul, Minn., on March 14.Stephen Maturen / AFP via Getty Images\n\nMINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (HOL) -- Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, recently announced as Kamala Harris's running mate for the 2024 presidential election, did not change the state flag to resemble the Somali flag or Puntland's state flag. This claim, which surfaced on social media after the announcement, is false.\n\nThe new Minnesota state flag and seal, introduced in May, were redesigned to address concerns from Native American communities about the old design. The previous flag depicted a white settler and an Indigenous man, imagery criticized for being a painful reminder of conquest and displacement. In 2023, the Minnesota Legislature established the State Emblems Redesign Commission to oversee the redesign. Governor Walz signed the bill into law but did not participate in the design process. The commission comprised public officials, design experts, and representatives from tribal and other communities of colour.\n\nThe commission received over 2,600 design proposals from the public and selected a design by Andrew Prekker, a 25-year-old from Luverne, Minnesota. Prekker's design originally included three horizontal stripes (white, green, and light blue) and a navy blue Minnesota outline with an eight-pointed star. The final design simplified the elements, featuring a dark blue shape of Minnesota with a white, eight-pointed star and a light blue background representing the state's abundant waters.\n\nContrary to the claims, the new flag does not resemble the Somali national flag, which features a five-pointed star on a light blue background. Instead, comparisons have been drawn to the flag of Puntland, a region in Somalia. Minnesota is home to the largest Somali population in the U.S., including U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, who hails from this region, contributing to these misconceptions. Prekker confirmed that neither Governor Walz nor any Somali flag influenced his design. The inspiration came from Minnesota's own history, symbolized by its motto, \"L'etoile Du Nord,\" meaning \"star of the north.\"\n\nThe redesign aimed to create a unifying symbol reflecting Minnesota's diverse history and culture. Experts praised the new design for its simplicity, uniqueness, and meaningful symbols. The North American Vexillological Association awarded the new flag an \"A+\" for its design. It was officially flown for the first time on May 11, 2024.\n\nWalz's selection as Harris's running mate highlights his appeal to rural, conservative voters and his record of progressive accomplishments as governor. His background as a soldier, teacher, coach, and congressman complements Harris's experience and aims to broaden the Democratic ticket's appeal in battleground states."],"source":{"uri":["hiiraan.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Hiiraan Online"]},"authors":[],"image":["http://www.hiiraan.com/2024/images/Aug/202487638585921161123714.jpg"],"eventUri":["eng-9796289"],"sentiment":[-0.051],"wgt":[460705932],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8262909723"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["05:39:52"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T05:39:52Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T05:39:12Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://dnyuz.com/2024/08/07/mark-cuban-says-the-2024-election-is-coming-down-to-ivy-league-insiders-versus-outsiders/"],"title":["Mark Cuban says the 2024 election is coming down to Ivy League insiders versus outsiders"],"body":["The 2024 presidential election is shaping up to be a smackdown between Ivy League insiders and outsiders, \"Shark Tank\" star Mark Cuban said on Tuesday.\n\nHarris and Walz, on the other hand, didn't go to Ivy League colleges.\n\nHarris earned her bachelor's degree at Howard University, a historically black college, in 1986. She went on to earn her law degree at UC Hastings, which has since been renamed to UC Law, in 1989.\n\nWalz pursued his undergraduate education at Chadron State College, a small public college in Nebraska, and graduated in 1989. He later earned a master's degree from Minnesota State University, Mankato, in 2001.\n\nCuban would later acknowledge that calling the matchup a fight between public schools and the Ivy League wasn't wholly accurate, given that Howard University is a private college and Vance is an Ohio State alum.\n\nBut while most would assume that an Ivy League education would be a plus among voters, Cuban says that Harris' and Walz's relatability would serve them well.\n\n\"People are tired of the ideologues and hate from both parties.

Tim Walz to be her running mate in the 2024 Presidential election. The selection feels out of left field for many, as Walz was not a well-known figure nationally prior to his selection. However, Walz reportedly received support from prominent Democrats including Nancy Pelosi, and his star has been rising in recent weeks.\n\nWith Walz joining the ticket, the question many are asking is - what are his positions on Israel?\n\nIn 2009, Walz traveled to Israel as a part of a diplomatic trip to the Middle East. He met with both Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, and Syrian dictator Bashar al-Asad. During his time in Congress, Walz voted alongside his fellow Democrats to send foreign military aid to Israel. However he also joined his fellow democrats in supporting the Iran deal.\n\nFollowing Hamas's brutal attacks on October 7th, Walz ordered the flags in his state of Minnesota to be flown at half mast, and spoke out against those who did not condemn the attacks.\n\nAt a service at Congregation Beth El in suburban Minneapolis following the attacks, Walz said: \"If you did not find moral clarity on Saturday morning, and you find yourself waiting to think about what you needed to say, you need to reevaluate where you're at,\"\n\n\"What was evident on Saturday morning was the absolute lack of humanity, the terrorism and the barbarism,\" \"That's not a geopolitical discussion. That's murder.\"\n\nHowever since that time, Walz has mostly stayed out of political discussions on the issue, and has not taken a firm stance on the conflict itself.\n\nHowever, Walz has indicated he believes in tolerance for anti-Israel protesters, despite their antisemitism. When over 18% of Minnesota voters decided to protest President Biden's support of Israel by voting \"uncommitted\" in the Democratic primary, Walz emphasized that their criticism should not be dismissed out of hand.\n\n\"We've got eight months. We've got to bring these people back in and listen to what they're saying,\" Walz said. \"Take them seriously. Their message is clear, that they think this is an intolerable situation and we can do more, and I think the president is hearing that.\"\n\nAt the same time, Walz has expressed support for Jews facing hostility over the conflict, telling PBS: \"I think when Jewish students are telling us they feel unsafe in that, we need to believe them, and I do believe them,\"\n\n\"Creating a space where political dissent or political rallying can happen is one thing.

He later earned a master's degree from Minnesota State University, Mankato, in 2001.\n\nCuban would later acknowledge that calling the matchup a fight between public schools and the Ivy League wasn't wholly accurate, given that Howard University is a private college and Vance is an Ohio State alum.\n\nBut while most would assume that an Ivy League education would be a plus among voters, Cuban says that Harris' and Walz's relatability would serve them well.\n\n\"People are tired of the ideologues and hate from both parties. They want to vote for normal people they can relate to. Walz can sit at the kitchen table and make you feel like you have known him forever,\" Cuban wrote in a separate X post.\n\nCuban declined to comment further on his posts when approached by Business Insider.\n\nFor what it's worth, since entering politics, Vance has been trying to distance himself from his college years at an elite institution.\n\nVance, who wrote in his memoir that graduating from Yale is the \"coolest thing\" he has ever done, ripped the US higher education system during his keynote address at the National Conservatism Conference in 2021.\n\n\"How ridiculous is it that we tell our young people to go to college to get brainwashed?\" Vance said then.\n\n\"We have got to get out of the mindset that the only way to live a good life in this country, the only way for our children to succeed, is to go to a four-year university where people will learn to hate their country and acquire a lot of debt in the process.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Trump has been more than eager to flaunt his educational credentials and smarts.\n\nThe property mogul once touted his Wharton education as \"super genius stuff\" and often mentions his late uncle, John Trump, who was an MIT faculty member, during rallies.\n\n\"Same genes. We have genes. We're smart people,\" Trump told rally-goers in Las Vegas in January. \"We're like racehorses, too. You know, the fast ones produce the fast ones, and the slow ones, well it doesn't work out so well, right?\"\n\nRepresentatives for the Harris and Trump campaigns didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"],"source":{"uri":["businessinsider.nl"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Business Insider Nederland"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/66b2d7acb4912df3ae197e7a.jpg?ver=1723006839"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.0902],"wgt":[460703647],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8262869028"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["05:05:18"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T05:05:18Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T05:04:28Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.4275],"url":["https://www.yahoo.com/news/campaign-context-presidential-candidate-campaign-033420486.html"],"title":["Campaign Context: New presidential candidate, new campaign strategy?"],"body":["As campaign season continues, politicians are turning up the volume on campaign rhetoric. To cut through the noise, we're launching Campaign Context, a series providing clarity on the messages you're hearing from candidates on the campaign trail. We're digging past the politics and into the facts to provide you with the transparent, spin-free information you need to make informed decisions this election season.\n\nAUSTIN (KXAN) -- Just hours after Vice President Kamala Harris announced Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate Tuesday, Harris and Walz wasted no time appealing to battleground state voters by holding a rally in Philadelphia.\n\nREAD MORE: Campaign Context\n\nPennsylvania is widely considered a battleground state in the 2024 presidential election along with six other states -- Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona, Nevada and Georgia.\n\nAfter President Biden stepped aside in the race, KXAN wondered whether the Harris campaign would follow the same playbook used by Biden, so we reached out to Dr. Richard Pineda, a professor at University of Texas at El Paso. Pineda said there are a few key areas where Harris will likely adjust her strategy.\n\n\"In some of the traditional industrial states -- we're talking about Michigan and Pennsylvania -- I think that the vice president needs to really talk about the economic benefits that this administration has brought, especially on infrastructure development,\" Pineda said. \"I don't think that the president would not have done that, but I think that it's even more important for her to talk about her role in making those decisions and being a part of the conversation.\"\n\nPineda said South Carolina and Georgia could be in play for Democrats this election in part because virtually all polling shows Harris leads Trump among Black voters by a wide margin. A national polling average shows Harris leads with Black voters by 53.1 points (72.4 percent to 19.3 percent).\n\nPineda also said Harris has an opportunity to gain votes from women who identify as moderately conservative and \"who might be afraid of a four-year Trump term and the impact potentially on reproductive rights.\"\n\nAs for former President Trump's campaign, Pineda said a big shift in strategy is unlikely.\n\n\"On the Republican side, I don't necessarily see there's going to be much of a change,\" Pineda said. \"You've already heard some of the rhetoric. The former president is really good at using immigration and forcing that as an issue no matter where he goes, so I don't think that changes.\"\n\nWhile Trump isn't expected to make a significant shift in campaign strategy, Pineda did say he sees mounting pressure on Trump and his running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance, to talk more about how they plan to empower the middle class now that Harris is the Democratic nominee.\n\nTrump is set to travel to Montana on Friday, a state where he won almost 57% of the vote in 2020, followed by Colorado on Saturday. Harris and Walz will continue to target those battleground states -- hitting all seven in a campaign blitz over the next four days.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

As we get closer to Election Day, the media, philanthropic institutions and everyday citizens alike focus on which candidate will win. The outcomes matter -- they matter a great deal -- and so it is tempting and understandable to fixate on them.\n\nBut overly focusing on what we do not and cannot know distracts us from being prepared to actually live and have impact following Nov. 5. Regardless of who wins the election, we must remain committed to strengthening civil society and trust in our institutions, and combating polarization and eschewing political violence -- not only for funders directly focused on democracy, but all funders, because polarization and the absence of trust threaten all of us, not just some of us.\n\nBut on this front at least, there is good news: There are strong strategies to maximize our ability to work and be resilient to any outcome. I'll break many larger strategies into two buckets: embracing the possibility of many outcomes, and moving to where you have greater certainty.\n\nStrategically this means planning with implementing partners for any eventuality after the election. Ahead of the election, work to identify organizations and causes to support so you can begin deepening relationships and developing a giving strategy. Look for national, state-level and grassroots organizations to impact efforts at various levels that align with your mission and understand where your support can have the greatest potential impact. Prepare for every scenario.\n\nActual scenario planning -- which can be as simple as holding a meeting to just share how your actions and objectives would respond to different electoral outcomes -- can help clarify your next steps. Evaluate your goals and what can be done to achieve them in various scenarios to ensure your philanthropic support continues uninterrupted, regardless of the results, which will likely be received with discontentment by many voters. This planning will give you and your partners hope and agency -- powerful counter-agents for the feelings some results may evoke.\n\nOperationally this means you need to remove the bureaucratic hurdles so grantees can respond in the moment. Goals won't change, but how to achieve them, and with whom, might. Making it easy for your chosen implementing partners to leverage your support is critical to the continuation of this work. You can offer flexible terms and longer-term funding to provide budget stability, extend reporting deadlines to spread the workload and write contracts making it clear to grantees that pivots are welcome and expected.\n\nBucket two: Moving to where you have greater certainty\n\nIn a world of much uncertainty, make investments in areas of higher certainty. For example your decision should be based on long-term strategy, rather than the pressures of the moment, or based on states and local community investments. The period between now and the final certification of election results will be fraught with uncertainty and heightened emotions. In such a volatile environment, it's tempting to make financial commitments based on the news of the day, public pressure or other external factors. Nevertheless, remain steadfast in your strategic priorities.\n\nState-level and grassroots causes can serve as a valuable complement to national organizations, which may have more resources but are often less agile and more susceptible to internal bureaucracy and external pressures. That's why since September 2023, Common Ground USA has worked in Pennsylvania and Texas to build cross-partisan coalitions of community leaders including veterans, faith leaders and business groups committed to addressing political divisiveness and hyper-partisanship in their communities to mitigate potential violence around the 2024 election results.\n\nThis work is critical, and cannot continue without the support of donors dedicated to making an impact during this tense political time. As donors, you must lay the groundwork now to ensure that you can remain a good partner to philanthropic organizations in times of political uncertainty. This requires you to plan for resilience with partners now, make investments based on long-term strategy and clear the bureaucratic field so that groups can respond in the moment, ensuring that we can safely navigate any outcome on and after Election Day.\n\nThis is also why Common Ground USA has worked with the Plessy & Ferguson Initiative to empower communities in New Orleans to constructively address the lasting impact of racial violence - furthering our broader goal of mitigating political violence across the United States, one community at a time.\n\nOn Nov. 6, the hard but important work of peacefully certifying our election results and preparing for the next election will begin. Government and civil society will need to combat disinformation and violence while assuring concerned Americans that the election was administered freely, fairly and in accordance with our laws and values. That work cannot begin on Nov. 6 -- it takes careful planning and execution over many months to succeed. Despite the numerous reasons to feel discouraged or upset about this election cycle, donors must resist the temptation to give up. Instead, you can take proactive steps now to strengthen relationships and enable flexibility with implementing partners, ensuring that their crucial work continues regardless of the outcome this November."],"source":{"uri":["thefulcrum.us"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["The Fulcrum"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://thefulcrum.us/media-library/american-flag-and-100-bill-overlayed.jpg?id=53104585&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C683%2C0%2C341"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.4118],"wgt":[460701666],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8262821217"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["04:19:15"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T04:19:15Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T04:17:16Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.4235],"url":["https://sputnikglobe.com/20240807/veep-mania-1119663835.html"],"title":["Veep Mania"],"body":["https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/08/06/1119661171_0:0:2000:1125_1920x0_80_0_0_3e9fb6a33bb8fa5949e743a96a0fb81e.jpg.webpUS Vice President Kamala Harris has chosen her running mate for the 2024 US presidential election. Tim Walz, 60, is the governor of Minnesota and has a history of swaying Republican districts with progressive policies. Following President Joe Biden's exit from the race the governor may help build enthusiasm for policies favored by Democrats as opposed to merely running a negative campaign against former President Donald Trump.Walz formerly worked as a teacher in China, Nebraska, and Minnesota, where he also worked as a football coach. He served in the army national guard for 24 years and was the faculty adviser for the school's first gay-straight alliance chapter in 1999.Walz's supporters say he will appeal to undecided voters as a down-to-Earth teacher but holds a track record of defeating Republicans that Democrats will view as favorable. Progressive policies he pursued in Minnesota include free school meals, abortion protection, gun control legislation and the legalization of marijuana.Walz was responsible for kicking off a new attack line against Trump and his running mate Ohio Senator JD Vance, who is also a Midwesterner, as \"weird\". The label has resonated with Harris' supporters and has been difficult for Trump and other Republicans to respond to.\"I met Tim Walz and I knew Tim Walz,\" she said. \"I didn't have to say, what's this guy all about and what's his agenda? I knew his agenda, because I had high school teachers just like him, who cared about their students and cared about their community.\"Republicans will likely attack his state's handling of the George Floyd - a Black man who was murdered by police - protests in 2020. Some believe he should have deployed the state's National Guard sooner to combat the looting, arson and violence which took place during the racial justice protests.Perhaps the most trying issue for Harris, who is still tied to the Biden administration, will be the White House's support for Israel's ethnic cleansing of Gaza.Fears of a regional war in the Middle East have been growing since the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in an attack on his residence in Tehran. Hamas has blamed Israel and the US for Haniyeh's death and vowed retaliation. Intelligence Minister Ismail Khatib said Israel ordered the strike after receiving a green light from the US.Nearly 40,000 people in Gaza have been killed since Israel's operation in Gaza began in October, according to the territory's health ministry. The US has given Israel more aid than any other nation since World War II."],"source":{"uri":["sputnikglobe.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Sputnik International"]},"authors":[{"uri":["mary_manley@sputnikglobe.com"],"name":["Mary Manley"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/images/sharing/article/eng/1119663835.jpg?11196611531723004018"],"eventUri":["eng-9795783"],"sentiment":[0.1294],"wgt":[460700355],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["2024-08-446393269"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["04:14:05"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T04:14:05Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T04:03:14Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.7882],"url":["https://indianexpress.com/article/world/slpp-namal-rajapaksa-sri-lanka-presidential-polls-9499666/"],"title":["SLPP to field Mahinda Rajapaksa's son Namal Rajapaksa for Sri Lankan presidential polls | World News - The Indian Express"],"body":["Namal Rajapaksa, 38, could become the youngest candidate to contest Sri Lanka presidential polls\n\nIn a surprising move late on Tuesday, the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) decided to field Namal Rajapaksa in the upcoming presidential polls. A formal announcement, expected shortly after the SLPP's high-level meeting on Wednesday morning, comes at a crucial time as the party and country are still grappling with the impacts of economic crisis and chaos.\n\nThe September 21 presidential election in Sri Lanka, the first since the 2022 people's uprising that ousted President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, promises to be a fiercely contested four-way race. Incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe will face off against Sajith Premadasa of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the leader of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP).\n\nThe decision to field Namal Rajapaksa, 38, emerged after MP Dhammika Perera, the SLPP candidate, informed the party he would not contest the 2024 Presidential Election due to personal reasons. Namal volunteered to contest, and the party backed the idea at a meeting on Tuesday night, a top SLPP source said. \"A high-level party meeting would formally announce the decision on Wednesday,\" the source added.\n\nNamal, the national organiser of the SLPP, will be the youngest candidate in this presidential poll. A senior SLPP leader said many believed the Mahinda family should step away from the contest due to the ongoing chaos in the country. \"This election will not be easy for anyone. Even as there are challenges and nobody is going to get 50 per cent vote share, Namal has been working hard in the past few years, especially focusing on the Northern region,\" the leader said.\n\nLast week, several SLPP Parliamentary groups supported President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who announced his intention to contest as an independent candidate, defying the party's decision to field its candidate. When asked about the MPs supporting Wickremesinghe, the party leader said, \"Those young SLPP MPs who supported Ranil Wickremesinghe's candidature will now support Namal.\"\n\nNamal is the eldest son of Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is seen as the most popular Sinhala Buddhist leader in Sri Lankan history. Namal has been slowly building his team for nearly a decade, focusing on both the south and east and permanently deploying and visiting Tamil-majority Northern Sri Lanka, escalating his direct engagements with the Tamil population.\n\nNamal contested the 2010 parliamentary election as one of the United People's Freedom Alliance's candidates in the Hambantota district and was elected to Parliament. His father, Mahinda, was an MP from Hambantota for 16 years before becoming the president in 2005.\n\nWhile Mahinda and his brother and former president Gotabaya are all known for their extreme Sinhala Buddhist views, Namal Rajapaksa in an interview with The Indian Express in 2018 spoke about his Sinhalese identity. \"Everyone believes in what they believe in. Protecting your own beliefs and culture is not extremism. I believe that it is always good to have a culture and belief in something. It is very important to take that forward to our next generation,\" he said.\n\nNamal graduated with a law degree from the City, University of London, and later qualified as an attorney at law from Sri Lanka Law College. He married Limini Weerasinghe in 2019 and they have two children."],"source":{"uri":["indianexpress.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["The Indian Express"]},"authors":[{"uri":["arun_janardhanan@indianexpress.com"],"name":["Arun Janardhanan"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/08/namal-rajapaksa.jpg"],"eventUri":["eng-9796500"],"sentiment":[0.0588],"wgt":[460700045],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8262809769"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["04:08:00"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T04:08:00Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T04:06:59Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["http://ctmirror.org/2024/08/07/ct-2024-election-equal-ballot-access/"],"title":["Opinion: CT must ensure equal ballot access before 2024 election"],"body":["According to our 2020 Census, 22.1 percent of Connecticut's population five years old and over speak a language other than English at home. Of that number, 8.3 percent - that's 275,126 people - speak English less than very well. The U.S. does not have an official language - not in federal law nor in our Constitution. Nor does Connecticut. In fact, according to work done by the Department of Consume Protection, \"the specific languages spoken across Connecticut are not uniformly distributed. Each region has a unique constituency with unique needs.\"\n\nWith unprecedented elections just weeks away, it's imperative that leaders act judiciously and with precision to allow all voters to have equal access in their own language when they go to the ballot box.\n\nBut Connecticut does not benefit from an Office of Language Access, as do other states, to ensure that limited English proficient (LEP) individuals have meaningful access and are able to participate fully in state-funded services. Instead, many agencies hire an out-of-state company without technical assistance or compliance to a federally required Language Access Plan.\n\nLast November, Hartford ballots failed to provide meaningful access and accuracy to voters and voting information for Spanish language constituents. The inaccuracy was not only inconceivable but unconstitutional, since it may have provided misinterpreted information to voters. The city's solution -- including an additional piece of paper with the ballot that includes correct instructions in Spanish, and assuming the inserts would ensure that \"everyone will be able to understand\" -- is cause for pause.\n\nIf similar errors were repeated during the 2024 presidential election, it would leave the Constitution State under scrutiny of epic proportions. Now is the opportunity to commit to meaningful access as indicated by numerous federal laws. The 1964 Civil Rights Act Title VI states: \"No person in the United States shall, on ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, or be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity.\" Civil Rights Executive Order 13166 of 2000 requires federal agencies to examine the services they provide, identify any need for services to those with limited English proficiency (LEP), to develop and implement a system which provides those services so LEP persons can have meaningful access to them.\n\nI had the opportunity to meet with Secretary of the State Stephanie Thomas several months ago on language issues, and she shared her concerns over how we can solve this problem. Not only does her office not have oversight over municipalities' ballots, she explained, but it does not have funding or a language access protocol and budget to secure federally mandated compliance.\n\nIn fact, a few state agencies shared concerns about their financial constraints and limitations in meeting compliance, despite Gov. Ned Lamont recently touting the fact that, \"the state's financial position is stable, and, unlike other states, we are not facing deficits that would result in deep cuts in spending or substantial increases in taxes.\"\n\nSecretary Thomas's work in civic engagement seems exhaustive and commendable, however, ballot access remains at a local level. She emphatically reiterated that her office requested for the Hartford ballots to be reprinted along with recommended language - something that did not happen.\n\nAs a linguist, certified language teacher, language access lead for Family Voices National, a national Municipal Language Access Network (MLAN) member and having formerly presided over several federally funded and federal funding entities in Connecticut, I have collaborated with hundreds of national government and quasi-government agencies regarding 60 years of federally mandated compliance best practices. The federal Department of Justice Office of Civil Rights has provided practical tips for addressing language barriers and equitable language access program planning while understanding the need for accurate communication with the public regardless of English proficiency. In fact, the DOJ has a four-factor test: the number of multilingual learners who need the service, the frequency of their contact, the importance of the service to their lives, and the resources available.\n\nVoter information access is about inclusion and access to our democracy, empowering civic responsibility and remaining competitive in today's global market. And we have a great example of what can be done in this state. In 2011, the Connecticut Judicial Branch adopted its first Language Access Plan, committed to \"providing equal access to all of its facilities, processes and information through the identification and elimination of barriers. As stated in its Strategic Plan, \"[c]onfidence in the judicial system stems from an individual's belief that he or she is being treated with respect, regardless of . . . proficiency in English.\"\n\nI plead for legislators to act with warp speed to ensure that all registered voters in the Constitution State can access their voter rights. State Rep. Gary Turco has committed to championing a bill that will codify 1964 Civil Rights Act Title VI Language Access to ensure Connecticut's federal compliance. We, the people know that time is of the essence with Election Day just around the corner. To wait for our next session, which begins January 8, 2025, would be too late! Connecticut needs a special session asap.\n\nWe're already scrambling as a nation to have a Constitutional election.

Voters looking for a more electable alternative to Trump now have somewhere to go -- a fact that could boost Democratic turnout.\n\nWhile Harris may present a liability for red-state Democrats, like Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., because of her progressive record, having her atop the ticket could be a help embattled Democrats in other close Senate races, like Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., according to experts and voters in the Silver State.\n\n\"When you're running in a presidential year, it's all about the top of the ticket,\" said Kenneth Miller, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, in an interview with the Deseret News. \"(Rosen's) fortunes rise and fall with the with the fortunes of the presidential race. So Biden's exit and Kamala Harris' entry was a massive boon for her campaign.\"\n\nRosen, a one-term member of the U.S House and a former synagogue president, is running against Army veteran Sam Brown, who narrowly survived a roadside bomb in Afghanistan. Echoing national messaging by their respective parties, Rosen has emphasized abortion access while Brown has focused on inflation, immigration and energy.\n\nRosen has consistently led Brown in the polls, with the Real Clear Politics average putting her up by 4 percentage points, significantly outperforming Biden, who was down 5.6 points on average in the state. But polling better than your party's presidential candidate isn't typically a good sign, Miller said, because your election showing \"is going to come down to the president's number, you're not going to bring the president's number up.\"\n\n\"(Rosen) was in a situation where it really looked like Biden was going to drag her down,\" Miller said. \"Biden's exit has eliminated that problem.\"\n\nOnly one poll has been conducted in Nevada since Biden withdrew himself on July 21 and Harris emerged as the party's presumptive nominee. It shows Trump's lead in the state disappearing, and Harris ahead by 2 points, according to the Bloomberg-Morning Consult poll.\n\nPolls only represent a snapshot of how voters are feeling. But the current national snapshot is of a race moving in Harris' direction.\n\nThe latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll shows Harris up 51%-48% over Trump, 4 percentage points better than her showing two weeks ago, according to the same poll. A new University of Massachusetts Amherst-YouGov poll conducted over the weekend also shows Harris with a 3-percentage-point lead -- a 7-point swing from the poll's findings of a Trump-Biden rematch in January.\n\nHarris led Trump by 1 percentage point nationally, and was tied in the key battleground states, according to a CBS News/YouGov poll released Sunday. And a Morning Consult poll published on Monday showed Harris leading Trump by 4 points. The Hill/Decision Desk HQ now shows Harris and Trump neck and neck in an average of national polls. And pollster Nate Silver's electoral forecast showed Harris leading Trump for the first time on Monday.\n\nJust a few days after Biden dropped out, Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio predicted a \"Harris Honeymoon\" period that would exaggerate her popularity as voters expressed interest in a relatively unknown candidate. The temporary shift in polling would not represent a shift in the fundamentals of the race, Fabrizio said.\n\nBut Miller said the shift from Biden to Harris will have a very real impact on who comes out to vote: \"People decide whether or not participate in the election based on the biggest races.\"\n\nLifelong Nevada resident Lindsey Forbes told the Deseret News she was a \"decided\" vote for Rosen because of her stance on abortion. But having Harris as the Democratic standard bearer has increased her motivation to volunteer her time for the campaign.\n\n\"I think that I was always going to vote but I feel more energized to get people around me to vote,\" Forbes said.\n\nRobert Ellis, who works in casino security in Reno, Nevada, told the Deseret News his electoral decisions are motivated by a desire to keep Trump out of office because Ellis sees the former president as irresponsible and a threat to the country's democratic institutions. While he said he would \"vote for any Democrat over Trump,\" Ellis believes that Biden being replaced expands the Democratic base from anti-Trump voters to those who want to vote for Harris.\n\n\"The morale has been lifted and people are more energized for sure,\" Ellis said. \"I think people would vote against Trump. Now there's going to be more people who will vote Democrat.\"\n\nTo Zach Guymon, a Las Vegas-based GOP strategist at Reformation Strategies, it's no surprise that Nevadans are now more likely to vote for Democrats in November, including for Rosen. But don't let the recent wave of positive polls create an exaggerated perception of Harris' popularity, Guymon cautioned.\n\n\"They replaced the worst Democratic candidate they could ever have with a still deeply flawed, pretty unpopular Democratic nominee,\" Guymon said.\n\nRepublicans have attacked Harris for her role in the Biden administration's efforts to stem migration at the southern border, as well as her past stances on universal health care programs, gun control and a Green New deal. Harris has yet to face significant media scrutiny and hasn't sat down for an interview since becoming her party's nominee for president.\n\nBut as the electorate gets to know Harris better, and even when she does make an inevitable gaffe, it is unlikely to derail her campaign because the bar was set so low by Biden, Guymon said."],"source":{"uri":["yahoo.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Yahoo"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://media.zenfs.com/en/deseret_news_992/c8af32611ea3e722ffa2500f437cd4d9"],"eventUri":["eng-9792426"],"sentiment":[0.2157],"wgt":[460697066],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8262768616"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["03:21:45"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T03:21:45Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T03:20:49Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.8745],"url":["https://www.businessinsider.in/entertainment/news/taylor-swift-fans-are-celebrating-kamala-harris-running-mate-tim-walz-as-a-certified-swiftie-vp/articleshow/112328048.cms"],"title":["Taylor Swift fans are celebrating Kamala Harris' running mate Tim Walz as a certified 'Swiftie VP' | Business Insider India"],"body":["Some of Taylor Swift's fans have celebrated her choice on social media, dubbing Walz \"one of us.\"\n\nTaylor Swift fans are rejoicing after Vice President Kamala Harris selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate.\n\nAfter the announcement Tuesday, Swifties quickly unearthed Walz's tweets and statements about their musical idol.\n\nIn November 2022, shortly after Ticketmaster bungled the general sale for Swift's Eras Tour, Walz shared an anguished-looking photo of his cat: \"Afton after being online all day and not getting Taylor Swift tickets,\" Walz wrote on X. (Swift famously loves cats and owns three.)\n\nTicketmaster's underwhelming response sparked uproar among Swifties; since then, Walz has continued to advocate for consumer rights and anti-monopoly regulations. Earlier this year, he signed the so-called \"Taylor Swift Bill,\" which guarantees more transparency and protection for people buying tickets online, into law in Minnesota.\n\nSwifties were also delighted that Walz proclaimed two \"Taylor Swift Days\" in Minnesota last year, June 23 and 24, to celebrate The Eras Tour coming to US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis.\n\n\"As followers of music and Taylor Swift's fans know all too well, Swift is one of the world's most influential, top-earning artists in the music and entertainment industry,\" Walz wrote in the official document that he shared on X, weaving in a reference to Swift's fan-favorite song, \"All Too Well.\"\n\nThe pun-filled document also included nods to song titles like \"Wildest Dreams,\" \"Mastermind,\" \"Lover,\" and \"The 1.\"\n\nThe fan account @Swifties4Kamala, which aims to mobilize Swift's passionate fan base and raise money for Harris' campaign, shared an enthusiastic reaction to Walz's announcement using a familiar strategy.\n\n\"SWIFTIE VP!! TICKETMASTER COUNT YOUR DAYS BABYYYYY!!!!!!!!\" one fan wrote on X, collecting over 43,000 likes at the time of writing.\n\nSome of Swift's fans have already made friendship bracelets in honor of Walz -- a longtime Eras Tour tradition that was inspired by the lyrics in Swift's song \"You're On Your Own, Kid.\" (\"So make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it / You've got no reason to be afraid.\")\n\nOne fan's bracelet reads, \"Long live the Walz,\" a nod to the lyric, \"Long live the walls we crashed through / How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you.\"\n\nHowever, Swift isn't the only pop star who's won Walz's support. Last year, Walz also declared July 20 as \"Beyoncé Day\" in Minnesota to mark her arrival for the Renaissance World Tour, thrilling members of the Beyhive on social media. \"He really gets it,\" one fan wrote.\n\nBeyoncé has already granted Harris permission to use her song \"Freedom\" during campaign events after gifting the vice president tickets to the Renaissance World Tour.\n\nAs for Swift, she has not yet endorsed Harris or publicly spoken about the 2024 presidential election. She previously endorsed President Joe Biden in 2020 and criticized then-president Donald Trump for \"stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism.\""],"source":{"uri":["businessinsider.in"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Business Insider India"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://staticbiassets.in/thumb/msid-112327582,width-700,resizemode-4,imgsize-108596/img66b26572a5247369a3e9d99b.jpg"],"eventUri":["eng-9796851"],"sentiment":[0.3961],"wgt":[460696905],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8262765906"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["03:18:18"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T03:18:18Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T03:17:42Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.451],"url":["https://sputnikglobe.com/20240807/dont-kick-the-left-wing-in-the-teeth-harris-unveils-new-running-mate-1119662901.html"],"title":["'Don't Kick the Left Wing in the Teeth': Harris Unveils New Running Mate"],"body":["Vice President Kamala Harris has chosen her running mate for the 2024 US presidential election. Tim Walz, 60, is a Minnesota governor who has a history of swaying Republican districts with progressive policies. Dan Lazare, an independent investigative journalist and author, joined Sputnik's The Critical Hour Tuesday to discuss Harris' pick.\"I don't want to exaggerate, certainly, but he has been on the progressive side. So, I guess Harris chose the guy who she thinks will unite, best unite the Democratic Party's various factions,\" he added.Walz was responsible for kicking off a new, and now popular, attack against former President Donald Trump and his running mate Ohio Senator JD Vance by labeling the two as \"weird.\" The label has resonated with Harris' supporters and has proven difficult for Trump and other Republicans to respond to.\"I think there probably will be a debate after all this maneuvering takes place. I mean, I'd be very surprised if no debate occurs, number one. Number two, I've been saying all along that I think that Harris may actually be a better campaigner than people expect,\" Lazare said.Trump has reportedly backed out of a planned debate with Harris as he struggles to find a way to attack his new opponent. The 78-year-old previously said he was prepared to do \"10 debates\" with President Joe Biden, but is now dodging a debate with Harris who still plans to appear on September 10 on ABC, regardless of whether or not Trump is present. Trump has said he would like to change the debate's platform so it can be held by Fox News and would prefer for it to take place before a \"full arena audience\".\"..All the stuff about Tim Walz being a nice guy and progressive, that's just window dressing. There is no doubt that the Democratic Party and the Washington foreign policy establishment are just arm and arm, and there's no deviation whatsoever from that war-like foreign policy,\" Lazare explained. \"I am sure that Harris will pursue exactly the same policy in the Ukraine and in Gaza, in Israel-Gaza and even with regard to China.\"Fears of a regional war in the Middle East have been growing since the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in an attack on his residence in Tehran. Hamas has blamed Israel and the US for Haniyeh's death and vowed retaliation. Intelligence Minister Ismail Khatib said Israel ordered the strike after receiving a green light from the US.Nearly 40,000 people in Gaza have been killed since Israel's operation in Gaza began in October, according to the territory's health ministry.

The campaign announced Tuesday evening it had raised more than $20 million since that very morning's announcement of Walz as Harris' running mate.\n\nWalz, 60, said he'll campaign every single day to defeat Donald Trump and J.D. Vance. \"We'll sleep when we're dead,\" he thundered, his own voice drowned out by the crowd's exuberance.\n\n\"I can't wait to debate the guy,\" Walz said of Vance, adding -- seemingly unable to contain himself -- \"that is, if he's willing to get off the couch and show up.\"\n\n\"He's weird as hell,\" the new vice presidential aspirant said, repeating the viral label he created to describe the Trump-Vance ticket.\n\nHarris said comparing her running mate's resume with Trump's running mate's resume is \"like a match-up between the varsity team and the JV squad.\"\n\nBut at other points, she didn't appear so confident.\n\n\"We are the underdogs in this race,\" Harris said, \"but we have the momentum and I know exactly what we are up against,\" opening her now pat salvo against Trump, who she said reminds her of the perpetrators, predators and scammers she prosecuted back in the day.\n\n\"So hear me when I say,\" she said, pausing long enough for the cheering to quiet. \"I know Donad Trump's type.\n\n\"Lock him up, lock him up, lock him up,\" supporters chanted, taking a page out of Trump's 2016 playbook against Hillary Clinton and turning it against Trump, a convicted felon who faces more trials to come on other federal charges.\n\nHarris described herself and Walz as \"middle class kids\" who grew up in different places, but both \"believe in lifting people up, not knocking 'em down.\"\n\nWalz followed a slew of local and state politicians, including Josh Shapiro, the governor and a veepstakes finalist, who unleashed non-stop attacks on Trump and Vance.\n\nShapiro ripped Vance as a man with a personal identity crisis.\"Y'all see that guy?\" he asked a crowd that roared as the governor boomed in his distinctive Obama-like cadence.\n\n\"He doesn't know who he is,\" Shapiro said. \"He's not being honest with himself, so he can't be honest with the American people.\"\n\nThe crowd at one point chanted: \"He's a weirdo, he's a weirdo.\"\n\nSen.

Our county-level presidential election forecasts predict the former president will win Pennsylvania by 41,489 votes, while we predict the vice president will win Michigan by 23,948 votes and Wisconsin by 29,024 votes.\n\nWhat you will learn:\n\nPennsylvania is the biggest prize of these three swing states, and we find that election results in swing state counties are particularly sensitive to changes in unemployment. Higher unemployment, even from extremely low levels, undermines Harris' support, according to our models. In 2016, rising unemployment, particularly in the swing county of Erie, pointed to trouble for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Harris is expected to win Michigan, but her margin of victory will be much smaller than Biden's in 2020. President Biden's approval, which is highly correlated with Harris's, is holding her back in the Wolverine State, according to our county models. Meanwhile, the vice president is expected to fare best in Wisconsin, but it's worth noting that the Badger State tends to produce suspenseful election results. Harris' choice of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has limited implications for our county election forecasts. Vice presidential candidates give a slight advantage to the presidential candidate's home state, and our models do not assume that Walz's popularity in Minnesota will spill over to neighboring Wisconsin.

Both women have been trailblazers in their own right, but their paths to the nomination reveal significant differences shaped by presidential backing, the power of incumbency, their articulate spirits, and levels of public acceptance.\n\nKamala Harris enjoys robust support from President Joe Biden, who selected her as his running mate in 2020 and endorsed her candidacy after his withdrawal from the 2024 race. This strong endorsement from a sitting president provides her campaign with significant weight and credibility. In contrast, Hillary Clinton received substantial backing from then-President Barack Obama during her 2016 campaign. While Obama's endorsement was influential, Clinton did not benefit from the same level of current governmental support that Harris now enjoys.\n\nAs the sitting Vice President, Harris benefits from the power of incumbency, which grants her high visibility and a platform to influence policy. This incumbency advantage positions her as a formidable candidate with direct experience in the executive branch.\n\nIn terms of public acceptance, Harris has garnered a diverse base of support, particularly among women, minorities, and younger voters. However, she also faces significant scrutiny and mixed perceptions among the broader electorate, which her campaign must address strategically. Clinton's 2016 campaign faced polarised opinions, with strong support from many Democratic voters but substantial opposition from others, partly due to long-standing controversies and political baggage. Given these comparisons, it is essential for the Harris campaign to adopt a strategic approach focused on winning the election rather than emphasising gender equality.\n\nWhile gender equality is an important issue, the primary focus should be on addressing a wide range of voter concerns such as the economy, healthcare, and national security. This strategy involves highlighting Harris's qualifications, experience, and vision for the future, rather than solely her status as a female candidate. Additionally, the campaign should balance Harris's empathetic and nurturing qualities with the strategic and competitive nature of the political landscape. Showcasing her as a strong, capable leader while maintaining her relatability can appeal to a broader electorate. Furthermore, the campaign must not underestimate the appeal and resilience of Donald Trump. Adopting a proactive approach to countering Trump's narratives with clear, decisive messaging and robust policy proposals is crucial, especially with limited time left before the election."],"source":{"uri":["tribuneonlineng.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Tribune Online"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/letter.png"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.5529],"wgt":[460691061],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8262684871"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["01:37:54"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T01:37:54Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T01:36:51Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.4588],"url":["https://www.latestly.com/india/news/live-news-updates-today-109-6169426.html"],"title":["Live News Updates Today | 📰 LatestLY"],"body":["New Delhi, August 7: The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is preparing for the launch of the Earth Observation Satellite-8 (EOS-8), expected on August 15.

Tim Walz for the Democratic ticket.\n\nThose who have known Walz for years have collected nuggets of information about the life and times of the second-term DFL governor. He and his wife since 1994, Gwen, have two children: Hope, who recently graduated from college in Montana, and Gus, who is in public high school in St. Paul.\n\nThe couple met when both were high school teachers in temporary classrooms in Nebraska.

His beverage of choice is Diet Mountain Dew, lots of it. He got a DWI in Nebraska in 1995 before he quit drinking. He is unfailingly punctual.

Tim Walz will be her running mate in the 2024 presidential election increased the spread of false claims about the Midwestern Democrat, some of which appeared on social media even before Harris made her pick public.\n\nHere's a look at the facts.\n\nCLAIM: Walz said on CNN that he wants to invest in a \"ladder factory\" to help people scale the wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and illegally enter the U.S.\n\nTHE FACTS: That's false. Posts are misrepresenting a comment Walz made on an episode of CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360\" last week. In the full segment, the Democrat criticizes former President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall on the southern border by joking about the hypothetical investment. He then gives multiple other examples of how to address illegal crossings into the U.S. through Mexico.\n\nAmid Harris' Tuesday announcement, social media users used a clip from the segment to make it seem as though the Minnesota governor was advocating for illegal immigration.\n\n\"He talks about this wall, I always say, 'let me know how high it is, if it's 25 feet then I'll invest in a 30-foot-ladder factory,'\" Walz says, referencing Trump. \"That's not how you stop this.\"\n\nOne X post that shared the clip reads: \"FLASHBACK: Kamala's VP pick, Tim Walz, says he should invest in a 'ladder factory' to help illegal aliens climb the border wall.\"\n\nBut Walz was not offering to help people enter the U.S. without authorization. He was actually discussing how to prevent this from happening.\n\nIn the full segment, after making the investment quip, Walz gives alternative ideas for how to handle illegal crossings on the southern border. Arrests for such crossings reached a record high in December, but dropped to a new low for the Biden administration at the end of July following a temporary ban on asylum.\n\n\"You stop this using electronics, you stop it using more border control agents and you stop it by having a legal system that allows for that tradition of allowing folks to come here just like my relatives did,\" Walz says near the end of the segment. \"To come here, be able to work and establish the American dream.\"\n\nHe also spoke in support of a bipartisan border security package intended to cut back on illegal crossings that the Senate voted down in February.\n\n-- Associated Press writer Melissa Goldin contributed this report.\n\nCLAIM: Walz changed the Minnesota flag so that it resembles the Somali flag.\n\nTHE FACTS: Minnesota did unfurl a new state flag and accompanying seal in May, but the changes were made to replace an old design that Native Americans said reminded them of painful memories of conquest and displacement. The State Emblems Redesign Commission was established during the 2023 legislative session to oversee the development of a new design.\n\nChanges were made to eliminate an old state seal that featured the image of a Native American riding off into the sunset while a white settler plowed his field with a rifle at the ready. The seal was a key feature of the old flag.\n\nThe commission included public officials, design experts and members of tribal and other communities of color. Its purpose statement dictated that the designs \"must accurately and respectfully reflect Minnesota's shared history, resources, and diverse cultural communities. Symbols, emblems, or likenesses that represent only a single community or person, regardless of whether real or stylized, may not be included in a design.\"\n\nThe public submitted more than 2,600 proposals and the commission picked one from Andrew Prekker, 25, of Luverne, as the basis for the flag.\n\nPrekker said Walz had nothing to do with the creation of the flag, and Somalia had nothing to do with the flag design. Minnesota is home to the largest Somali population in the U.S. and is home to U.S. Rep. Ilhan Oman, who was born in Somalia and is a member of an informal group of progressive Democratic House members known as The Squad.\n\n\"The inspiration behind my flag were three main concepts inspired by Minnesota's history and culture: The North Star, the Minnesota shape, and three stripes representing different facets of Minnesotan identity,\" he wrote in an email.\n\nPrekker's original design had the white star on the blue background with white, green and light blue stripes stretching over the rest of the flag. The flag was compared online with flags from states in Somalia that have green, white and blue stripes and a star. The stripes were dropped by the commission in the final design.\n\nThe final version of the flag features a dark blue shape resembling Minnesota with a white, eight-pointed star on it. The right side is light blue and is meant to symbolize the state's abundant waters that led to it being known as the Land of 10,000 Lakes.\n\nThe Somali flag has a five-point star on a light blue background. \"There is no connection to Somalia or any other country, and in complete honesty I didn't even know Somalia existed before the whole flag debacle. Any similarities people want to see are a coincidence. It is a Minnesotan flag, and that is what I designed it for,\" Prekker said.\n\nFind AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck."],"source":{"uri":["eagletribune.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Eagle-Tribune"]},"authors":[{"uri":["associated_press@eagletribune.com"],"name":["Associated Press"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eagletribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/88/7888a9d1-f954-5524-a827-eb94952cd4a9/66b2c6ade53a5.image.jpg?crop=1831%2C961%2C0%2C85&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[-0.0431],"wgt":[460688932],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8262663183"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["01:08:08"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T01:08:08Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T01:07:32Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/review-journal-teams-up-with-fox-for-battleground-election-series-3119551/"],"title":["Review-Journal teams up with Fox for 'Battleground' election series"],"body":["The Las Vegas Review-Journal is teaming up with Fox-owned local television stations on a weekday political series that focuses on battleground states ahead of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nHosted by journalist S.E.

Tim Walz is the official vice-presidential running mate for Vice President Kamala Harris in her campaign for the presidency. The Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump chose Ohio Senator JD Vance as his vice-presidential running mate last month.\n\nBoth candidates for vice president are far apart on several issues. Walz and Vance share views and policy points that almost mirror their running mates.\n\nBut what are the key issues where Walz and Vance disagree? Here are some topics where the candidate stand apart and may be discussed at a vice presidential debate.\n\nReproductive rights/Abortion\n\nA major issue in the 2024 presidential election is the issue of woman's reproductive rights and abortion. Walz, in his official campaign website, says the governor \"protected women's right to choose\" while serving the state of Minnesota and \"led the fight for reproductive freedom.\"\n\nIn 2023 he signed the PRO Act into law, which gave Minnesotans the fundamental right to make their own decisions regarding reproductive health, which includes the right to obtain an abortion along with other reproductive freedoms.\n\nVance has been a pro-life supporter in his political career. The New York Times reported that Vance said: \"It's not whether a woman should be forced to bring a child to term. It's whether a child should be allowed to live,\" in a statement to an Ohio radio host in September 2021 before Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\nCNN reported that Vance said in a podcast in 2022 that \"would like abortion to be illegal nationally\" but since has stated that he sides with Trump in his stance that states should decide their own abortion laws, as reported by the Guardian.\n\nImmigration\n\nVance, like former President Trump, has taken a hard stance on immigration citing a crisis on the southern border. Recently, Vance visited the US-Mexico border and berated the Joe Biden and Harris immigration policies. During his visit, he said, \"We got kids who can not learn in schools because they are overwhelmed with migrant children who should not be there.\"\n\nVance advocates for the completed construction of the border wall and mass deportations of illegal immigrants.\n\nWalz, on the other hand, has argued that \"immigrants strengthen our communities.\" He has written a letter to Congress that says elected officials need to work together for \"Dreamers,\" undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, to achieve a pathway to citizenship.\n\nHe signed a bill in March of 2023 that allowed anyone from Minnesota to receive a state driver's license regardless of immigration status.\n\nEducation\n\nIn his time as governor, Walz has prioritized public education. In his One Minnesota Budget, he increased state funding towards public education.\n\nHe also signed into a law a universal free school lunch bill which gave students, regardless of income, free breakfast and lunch everyday.\n\nOne of Vance's most passionate stances on education deals with affirmative action. He introduced the College Admissions Accountability Act to Congress where federal student assistance and institutional aid would need to abide by Equal Protection Clause and Title VI prohibitions on racial discrimination or racial preferences.\n\nVance states on his website, \"America's higher education cartel has discriminated against applicants and students by adhering to racial preferences under the banner of 'equity.'\"\n\nEconomics\n\nWalz has said he wants to be a champion to the working class. In his One Minnesota Budget it stated that nearly 1.4 million middle-class residents from Minnesota saw a cut in taxes.\n\nLast year, Walz also signed a bill that created a new paid leave program in Minnesota that will launch in 2026. It will provide medical leave, when a person's health condition keeps them from working, and family leave for when a family member is ill or time is needed for a new child.\n\nWalz says he wants to continue to \"cut taxes for working families\" on his campaign website.\n\nVance has promoted Trump's \"America first\" economic policy which promotes U.S. manufacturing and project American jobs by placing tariffs on imports from China and other countries.\n\nThe Republican vice presidential nominee has experience as a venture capitalist who made personal investments in Walmart, Bitcoin and real estate."],"source":{"uri":["northjersey.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["North Jersey"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://www.northjersey.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/08/06/USAT/74691272007-v-ptopper.jpg?crop=3708,2082,x211,y0&width=1600&height=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp"],"eventUri":["eng-9795783"],"sentiment":[-0.0039],"wgt":[460687047],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8262619216"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["00:09:20"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T00:09:20Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T00:08:33Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.9137],"url":["https://www.thestar.com/news/world/united-states/false-claims-follow-minnesota-governors-selection-as-harris-running-mate/article_e83e50b4-b70e-5308-ad80-cb634b29275b.html"],"title":["False claims follow Minnesota governor's selection as Harris' running mate"],"body":["Vice President Kamala Harris' announcement on Tuesday that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will be her running mate in the 2024 presidential election increased the spread of false claims about the Midwestern Democrat, some of which appeared on social media even before Harris made her pick public.\n\nHere's a look at the facts.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: Walz said on CNN that he wants to invest in a \"ladder factory\" to help people scale the wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and illegally enter the U.S.\n\nTHE FACTS: That's false. Posts are misrepresenting a comment Walz made on an episode of CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360\" last week. In the full segment, the Democrat criticizes former President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall on the southern border by joking about the hypothetical investment. He then gives multiple other examples of how to address illegal crossings into the U.S. through Mexico.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAmid Harris' Tuesday announcement, social media users used a clip from the segment to make it seem as though the Minnesota governor was advocating for illegal immigration.\n\n\"He talks about this wall, I always say, 'let me know how high it is, if it's 25 feet then I'll invest in a 30-foot-ladder factory,'\" Walz says, referencing Trump. \"That's not how you stop this.\"\n\nOne X post that shared the clip reads: \"FLASHBACK: Kamala's VP pick, Tim Walz, says he should invest in a 'ladder factory' to help illegal aliens climb the border wall.\"\n\nBut Walz was not offering to help people enter the U.S. without authorization. He was actually discussing how to prevent this from happening.\n\nIn the full segment, after making the investment quip, Walz gives alternative ideas for how to handle illegal crossings on the southern border. Arrests for such crossings reached a record high in December, but dropped to a new low for the Biden administration at the end of July following a temporary ban on asylum.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"You stop this using electronics, you stop it using more border control agents and you stop it by having a legal system that allows for that tradition of allowing folks to come here just like my relatives did,\" Walz says near the end of the segment. \"To come here, be able to work and establish the American dream.\"\n\nHe also spoke in support of a bipartisan border security package intended to cut back on illegal crossings that the Senate voted down in February.\n\n-- Associated Press writer Melissa Goldin contributed this report.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: Walz changed the Minnesota flag so that it resembles the Somali flag.\n\nTHE FACTS: Minnesota did unfurl a new state flag and accompanying seal in May, but the changes were made to replace an old design that Native Americans said reminded them of painful memories of conquest and displacement. The State Emblems Redesign Commission was established during the 2023 legislative session to oversee the development of a new design.\n\nChanges were made to eliminate an old state seal that featured the image of a Native American riding off into the sunset while a white settler plowed his field with a rifle at the ready. The seal was a key feature of the old flag.\n\nThe commission included public officials, design experts and members of tribal and other communities of color. Its purpose statement dictated that the designs \"must accurately and respectfully reflect Minnesota's shared history, resources, and diverse cultural communities. Symbols, emblems, or likenesses that represent only a single community or person, regardless of whether real or stylized, may not be included in a design.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe public submitted more than 2,600 proposals and the commission picked one from Andrew Prekker, 25, of Luverne, as the basis for the flag.\n\nPrekker said Walz had nothing to do with the creation of the flag, and Somalia had nothing to do with the flag design. Minnesota is home to the largest Somali population in the U.S. and is home to U.S. Rep. Ilhan Oman, who was born in Somalia and is a member of an informal group of progressive Democratic House members known as The Squad.\n\n\"The inspiration behind my flag were three main concepts inspired by Minnesota's history and culture: The North Star, the Minnesota shape, and three stripes representing different facets of Minnesotan identity,\" he wrote in an email.\n\nPrekker's original design had the white star on the blue background with white, green and light blue stripes stretching over the rest of the flag. The flag was compared online with flags from states in Somalia that have green, white and blue stripes and a star. The stripes were dropped by the commission in the final design.\n\nThe final version of the flag features a dark blue shape resembling Minnesota with a white, eight-pointed star on it. The right side is light blue and is meant to symbolize the state's abundant waters that led to it being known as the Land of 10,000 Lakes.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe Somali flag has a five-point star on a light blue background. \"There is no connection to Somalia or any other country, and in complete honesty I didn't even know Somalia existed before the whole flag debacle. Any similarities people want to see are a coincidence. It is a Minnesotan flag, and that is what I designed it for,\" Prekker said.\n\n___\n\nFind AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck.\n\nRead more on the U.S. Election at thestar.com"],"source":{"uri":["thestar.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["The Star"]},"authors":[{"uri":["associated_press@thestar.com"],"name":["Associated Press"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[true]}],"image":["https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/40/14012519-e9b5-5041-9c2d-e697fcc4902c/66b29bb55473d.image.jpg?crop=1280%2C672%2C0%2C59&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize"],"eventUri":["eng-9796289"],"sentiment":[-0.0588],"wgt":[460685360],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8262613679"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["00:08:06"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T00:08:06Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T00:02:14Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.7333],"url":["https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/kamala-harris-vice-president-pick-235038888.html"],"title":["Kamala Harris' vice president pick Tim Walz has a history of Taylor Swift, Beyoncé fandom"],"body":["Don't be surprised to find Tim Walz sporting friendship bracelets and a cowboy hat on the campaign trail.\n\nThe Minnesota governor, who was selected as Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris' running mate on Tuesday, has a history of pop fandom in his gubernatorial work.

He's a small-town boy who grew up working on a farm. A patriot who joined the National Guard and served for 20 years. A high school social studies teacher. A high school football coach. A veteran. A hunter, a gun owner, and a skilled marksman. A midwesterner who knows rural America. He's the type of man Republicans claim to love, but unlike the men who lead today's Republican Party, Walz has a heart.\n\nWalz is pro-union, supports a strong minimum wage, and voted for President Obama's Affordable Care Act when he served in Congress. And unlike the coach stereotype, he had the courage to serve as the faculty adviser for the student LGBTQ group on campus. He's funny on the stump, but he's a great attack dog. And he means business. Walz appointed Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to prosecute Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer who murdered George Floyd. But even though progressives love him, he doesn't come across as threatening to middle America.\n\n\"And in 91 days,\" as Harris said today, \"the nation will know Coach Walz by another name: Vice President of the United States.\"\n\nAs soon as Walz was announced, independent progressive Bernie Sanders endorsed him on the left, and conservative Joe Manchin endorsed him on the right. Do you know how hard that is to get those two to agree on anything? That's like a Nobel Peace Prize in Democratic politics. Heck, even AOC endorsed him.\n\nWalz helps heal the party and avoids a big conflict at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago over Gaza. He keeps the momentum going for Harris, and he matches her joyful energy.\n\nRELATED: 10 Big Lies Trump and the Republicans Tell About Kamala Harris\n\nBut isn't he another old white guy? Um, hello. Tim Walz, Kamala Harris, and I are all about the same age. We were born 16 months apart. And all of us are younger than Barack Obama. So, in my biased opinion, he's still a young guy. Yes, he looks a lot older than Kamala and me, but we all know black don't crack.\n\nAnd actually, his avuncular appearance and relatable life story make him much more appealing to the voters Harris needs to win the battleground states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. Comparing JD Vance to Walz is like a \"matchup between the varsity team and the JV squad,\" Harris said today.\n\nI know some people wanted other candidates, and they all had different assets. Mark Kelly is an astronaut. Pete Buttigieg is a great communicator. Josh Shapiro is hugely popular in the critical state of Pennsylvania. And originally, I wanted Andy Beshear, the youthful governor of Kentucky.\n\nBut in the past few weeks of watching him campaign for Harris, Walz won me over.\n\n\"You've legalized recreational marijuana, you passed universal background checks on guns, you expanded LGBTQ protections, you implemented tuition-free college for low-income Minnesotans. There's free breakfast and lunch for school kids,\" Jake Tapper said to him in a recent CNN interview.\n\nRELATED: If Trump Wins, Republican Judges Will Rule the Courts -- and Our Lives\n\nWalz didn't skip a beat. \"What a monster,\" he said. \"Kids are having full bellies so they can learn.\" He didn't shy away from his record. He firmly defended it.\n\nRepublicans are already trying to sow division in the party by claiming that Harris didn't pick Shapiro because he's Jewish and claiming, \"No Jews allowed at the top of the Democratic Party.\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer quickly put that argument to rest, but the nerve of the straight, Christian, white male-dominated Republican Party to complain about diversity in the Democratic Party. Give me a break.\n\nDemocrats nominated the first woman for vice president in 1984 (Geraldine Ferraro, the first Jewish candidate for vice president in 2000 (Joe Lieberman), the first Black president in 2008 (Barack Obama), the first woman candidate for president in 2016 (Hillary Clinton), and now the first Black woman and first South Asian woman for president in 2024 (Kamala Harris). Meanwhile, Republicans have given us nothing but white men on the ticket for the past four elections.\n\nThat's why I like Walz. He balances the ticket, and his energy matches Kamala's. Other candidates are good on the attack, but Walz does the same with a smile. And when they join forces, they make a great team. As Walz said in Philadelphia today, \"Thank you for bringing back the joy.\"\n\nHarris and Walz are happy warriors fighting for a hopeful future, while Trump and Vance are mean-spirited men stoking fear with a backward-focused campaign of doom and gloom.\n\nMany of you don't know who Tim Walz is, but trust me, when you see him in the next few weeks, you will not be disappointed. Kamala Harris made a bold choice in picking Walz. Now let's go win."],"source":{"uri":["theatlantavoice.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["The Atlanta Voice | Atlanta GA News"]},"authors":[{"uri":["word_in_black@theatlantavoice.com"],"name":["Word In Black"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]},{"uri":["keith_boykin@theatlantavoice.com"],"name":["Keith Boykin"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://i0.wp.com/theatlantavoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165606600.jpg?fit=1024%2C713&quality=89&ssl=1"],"eventUri":["eng-9795783"],"sentiment":[-0.0353],"wgt":[460684410],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8262600410"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-06"],"time":["23:51:01"],"dateTime":["2024-08-06T23:51:01Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-06T23:46:35Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://conservativeangle.com/flashback-walz-was-in-on-the-biden-cover-up-said-hes-fit-for-office/"],"title":["FLASHBACK: Walz Was In On The Biden Cover-Up, Said 'He's Fit For Office' - Conservative Angle"],"body":["Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz was one of the many Democrats who participated in the recent cover up, saying publicly that President Joe Biden's health wasn't failing when he claimed in July that Biden was \"fit for office.\"\n\nIn a throwback clip from CNN dated July 3, 2024, Walz spoke to the press outside the White House and told the American people that Biden was going to be able to stay in the presidential race against former President Donald Trump, amid an onslaught of calls for Biden to step out of the race due to his disastrous CNN presidential debate performance against Trump.\n\n\"Yes, fit for office,\" Walz said when asked by reporters if the president was \"fit for office\" following a closed-door meeting between Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and a handful of other Democrat governors, CNN noted.\n\n\"The president has 3 ½ years of delivering for us going through what we've all been through,\" he added. \"None of us are denying Thursday night was a bad performance,\" Walz said, in reference to Biden's debate with former President Trump on June 27 of this year. \"It was a bad hit, if you will on that, but it doesn't impact what I believe: He's delivering.\"\n\nWhen pressed further by reporters about whether Biden had explained to Walz his terrible debate performance, Walz replied, \"Yeah, he did. He said, 'Look,' he didn't listen to himself.\"\n\n\"I think this idea that you get in your own head, you get a little bit cycled up on that,\" he added.

Where's Nancy?\"\n\nThat was the chilling question the intruder posed to Paul Pelosi before bludgeoning the then-82-year-old over the head with a hammer in their San Francisco house. It echoed the menacing jeers of the rioters roaming the halls of the Capitol calling out \"Nancy, Nancy\" on Jan. 6.\n\nThe through line of escalating political rhetoric and violence in American public life serves as the opening and closing message of Pelosi's new book, \"The Art of Power, My Story as America's First Woman Speaker of the House.\"\n\nPelosi recounts her nearly four-decade legislative record in Congress but also allows a rare public glimpse into the private devastation around the assault on her husband. With it, she delivers a grave warning that the casual mockery and mimicry of political violence in America is chasing a generation from public service.\n\n\"The current climate of threats and attacks must stop,\" Pelosi writes.\n\n\"We cannot ask people to serve in public life if the cost is risking the safety of their families and those they love.\"\n\nPelosi's book pages through familiar terrain for those who have followed the 84-year-old's career, rising from \"housewife to House member to House speaker.\" The steely California Democrat, the speaker emerita, is no longer in leadership but running for reelection to the House this fall.\n\nShe twice won the speakers gavel, worked alongside seven presidents and, more recently, played a pivotal role in quietly convincing President Joe Biden to reassess his decision to remain in the 2024 presidential election rematch with Republican Donald Trump. Biden bowed out.\n\nBut it's the first and final chapters that bring a new element to the Pelosi era, detailing in personal and painstaking ways the toll that America's violent strain is taking on civic life and public service.\n\n\"I don't know that we will ever feel safe,\" she writes.\n\nWritten well before the July assassination attempt on Trump, Pelosi's assessment of the nation's dangerous discourse arrives after back-to-back congressional shootings of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise and earlier of Democratic former Rep. Gabby Giffords, and it serves as a walk-off warning in what could be among her final years in Congress.\n\nPelosi recounts her disbelief at being \"pulled off the Speaker's platform\" and out of the House chamber by security the afternoon of Jan. 6 as rioters sent by Trump stormed through the halls, some searching for her.\n\n\"I can handle it,\" she protested, telling U.S. Capitol Police she wanted to stay and finish the work as Congress was certifying the 2020 election.\n\n\"Their response was curt,\" she writes. \"'No, you can't.'\"\n\nAfter being whisked away to safety at Fort McNair, she writes about huddling with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, the three of them desperately calling the Pentagon to send National Guard troops to restore order at the Capitol. She describes House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump loyalist, as almost entirely unseen.\n\nSo worried about the rioters' threats against Vice President Mike Pence in hiding at the Capitol, she called and told him, \"Don't let anybody know where you are.\"\n\n\"It still took three hours from the time I was dragged out of the House chamber for the Guard to arrive at the Capitol complex,\" she writes. \"It took about three and a half hours to clear the rioters from the building.\"\n\nLater, surveying the wreckage of broken glass and splintered wood, she was told of blood outside the Speaker's Lobby. In some places, including her office, the mob had \"literally defecated on the floors and rugs,\" she wrote. \"What was left behind was pure destruction.\"\n\nShe recalled being in war zones, and in Kyiv at the start of the Russian invasion thinking she may well die in Ukraine. \"I briefly thought the same on January 6,\" she wrote.\n\n\"When I became Speaker, I knew that I was making myself into a target,\" she writes. \"However, our accepting the risk is something that is fundamentally different for our families.\"\n\nNot quite two years later, she was awakened in the middle of the night by the \"Knock. Knock. Knock. Pound, Pound. Pound,\" of the Capitol Police security detail at her door in Washington.\n\nPelosi recounts the dizzying hours, frantic family phone calls and flight back to San Francisco, the hospital, the surgeries and the long recovery for her husband. Their youngest daughter said he looked like a bandaged-up Frankenstein.\n\nHer son, Paul Jr., went to the family's home to vacuum up the broken glass and clean up the blood. Her daughter Alexandra, who had been a high schooler when Pelosi first ran for Congress, told her, had she known what they were signing up for she would \"never have given you my blessing.\"\n\nThe attacker was tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. But Pelosi writes, the story of Paul's attack would not go away.\n\n\"Our home remains a heartbreaking crime scene,\" she wrote.\n\nPelosi said her children told her that for a long time Paul would only sleep in the bedroom when she was there. He still suffers from headaches and dizzy spells, and she said she has seen him faint and fall twice from vertigo. As of February, she wrote, she was still changing bandages from surgery on his arm.\n\nBut the \"true horror\" she writes was the dehumanizing jokes by Republicans from Trump on down, including the former president's son, Donald Trump Jr., who posted a Paul Pelosi Halloween costume to social media, and the way the crowds would \"laugh, cheer, and applaud\" their cruel remarks.\n\n\"It made me profoundly sad for our country,\" she writes.\n\nPelosi situates the two bloody episodes in the arc of her career, from the way Republicans vilified her in countless campaign ads from the time she first rose as Democratic leader to the way protesters spit on Democrats, including civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, the day the House voted for the Affordable Care Act, to the severed pig's head left outside her family's home in the days before Jan. 6.\n\nPelosi writes that when she speaks to young people about running for office, \"especially young women, too often I hear their reluctance to put their families in harm's way.\"\n\n\"This is not the way our country should be -- if you engage in public service, you should not be a target, and your family should not be a target.\""],"source":{"uri":["gorgenewscenter.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["gorgenewscenter.com"]},"authors":[],"image":{},"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[-0.4431],"wgt":[460684139],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8262599439"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-06"],"time":["23:46:14"],"dateTime":["2024-08-06T23:46:14Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-06T23:45:15Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.8196],"url":["https://nypost.com/2024/08/06/entertainment/steve-martin-top-pick-to-play-kamala-harris-vp-tim-walz-on-snl/"],"title":["Steve Martin already name-dropped to play Kamala Harris' VP choice..."],"body":["Steve Martin has been deemed the perfect person to portray Kamala Harris' recently-announced VP pick, Minnesota Gov.

And I believe Governor Josh Shapiro is the right nominee to do so.\"\n\nThe Democrat added that Shapiro was the best pick not only due to his impressive approval rating, but because of his voter base in Pennsylvania - a swing state that Harris might need come November.\n\n\"Of course, my preference for Governor Josh Shapiro being that Pennsylvania seems to be the entire ballgame in 2024,\" Lafazan said.\n\n\"Harris could win Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada, and a couple other states and still lose without Pennsylvania.\n\n\"Having a governor with 60% approval rating, again in contemporary politics, that is Taylor Swift-like level of admiration.\n\n\"So his ability to bring crossover voters and win Pennsylvania, I think is issues one two and three of who you choose for the nomination.\n\n\"I think he is the best nominee that she could put forward,\" the politician added.\n\nSURPRISE VP ANNOUNCEMENT\n\nHowever, Harris announced Walz as her pick on Tuesday - much to the surprise of many Americans who had pegged Shapiro as the favorite.\n\n\"I really am surprised that that Josh Shapiro wasn't the nomination, and I think many Democratic strategists across the spectrum were surprised,\" Lafazan said on Tuesday.\n\n\"Given the importance of those electoral votes, those 19 electoral votes in Pennsylvania.\n\n\"So the idea that this governor, with astronomical approvals in Pennsylvania and who ideally would help carry the state, would not be the nominee in a really tight race...Obviously it projects confidence that the Kamala Harris advisors have that they can win Pennsylvania on their own merits.\"\n\nThe former legislator said it's unlikely that Walz could win swing state votes like Shapiro could have.\n\n\"If if I'm in that room, I would say who the choice of Vice Presidency is all about who can help deliver votes and win,\" Lafazan said about Harris' vice president decision.\n\n\"I don't see data that shows Tim Walz moving votes in the Midwest.

Arrests for such crossings reached a record high in December, but dropped to a new low for the Biden administration at the end of July following a temporary ban on asylum.\n\n\"You stop this using electronics, you stop it using more border control agents and you stop it by having a legal system that allows for that tradition of allowing folks to come here just like my relatives did,\" Walz says near the end of the segment. \"To come here, be able to work and establish the American dream.\"\n\nHe also spoke in support of a bipartisan border security package intended to cut back on illegal crossings that the Senate voted down in February.\n\n- Associated Press writer Melissa Goldin contributed this report.\n\nCLAIM: Walz changed the Minnesota flag so that it resembles the Somali flag.\n\nTHE FACTS: Minnesota did unfurl a new state flag and accompanying seal in May, but the changes were made to replace an old design that Native Americans said reminded them of painful memories of conquest and displacement. The State Emblems Redesign Commission was established during the 2023 legislative session to oversee the development of a new design.\n\nChanges were made to eliminate an old state seal that featured the image of a Native American riding off into the sunset while a white settler plowed his field with a rifle at the ready. The seal was a key feature of the old flag.\n\nThe commission included public officials, design experts and members of tribal and other communities of color. Its purpose statement dictated that the designs \"must accurately and respectfully reflect Minnesota´s shared history, resources, and diverse cultural communities. Symbols, emblems, or likenesses that represent only a single community or person, regardless of whether real or stylized, may not be included in a design.\"\n\nThe public submitted more than 2,600 proposals and the commission picked one from Andrew Prekker, 25, of Luverne, as the basis for the flag.\n\nPrekker said Walz had nothing to do with the creation of the flag, and Somalia had nothing to do with the flag design. Minnesota is home to the largest Somali population in the U.S. and is home to U.S. Rep. Ilhan Oman, who was born in Somalia and is a member of an informal group of progressive Democratic House members known as The Squad.\n\n\"The inspiration behind my flag were three main concepts inspired by Minnesota's history and culture: The North Star, the Minnesota shape, and three stripes representing different facets of Minnesotan identity,\" he wrote in an email.\n\nPrekker´s original design had the white star on the blue background with white, green and light blue stripes stretching over the rest of the flag. The flag was compared online with flags from states in Somalia that have green, white and blue stripes and a star. The stripes were dropped by the commission in the final design.\n\nThe final version of the flag features a dark blue shape resembling Minnesota with a white, eight-pointed star on it. The right side is light blue and is meant to symbolize the state´s abundant waters that led to it being known as the Land of 10,000 Lakes.\n\nThe Somali flag has a five-point star on a light blue background. \"There is no connection to Somalia or any other country, and in complete honesty I didn´t even know Somalia existed before the whole flag debacle. Any similarities people want to see are a coincidence. It is a Minnesotan flag, and that is what I designed it for,\" Prekker said.\n\nFind AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck."],"source":{"uri":["dailymail.co.uk"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Daily Mail Online"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/06/23/wire-88239787-1722985091-913_636x382.jpg"],"eventUri":["eng-9796289"],"sentiment":[-0.0431],"wgt":[460683213],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8262584287"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-06"],"time":["23:25:44"],"dateTime":["2024-08-06T23:25:44Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-06T23:24:53Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.benzinga.com/general/politics/24/08/40207776/harris-vs-trump-vice-president-leads-former-president-by-14-points-in-new-york-but-should-there-"],"title":["Harris Vs. Trump: Vice President Leads Former President By 14 Points In New York  --  But Should There Be Concern For Pivot To A Swing State?"],"body":["Kamala Harris gains back a large lead by Democrats in the state of New York.\n\nA head-to-head battle between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris could come down to swing states deciding who wins the 2024 presidential election.\n\nWhat Happened: Since President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential election, Harris has been gaining support for the Democratic Party against Trump in election polls.\n\nA new Siena College election poll shows Harris with a sizeable lead over Trump in the state of New York. The poll shows Harris with 53% of support from voters with Trump getting 39% of support, as reported by Politico.\n\nThe 14-point lead comes after Biden had posted leads of eight to 10 points in recent months. While the support is still lower than 18-to-30 point leads than Democratic presidential candidates have had in election polls in recent years, it shows that Harris has taken back support in New York.\n\nNew York has been dominated by Democrats in recent presidential elections with the state voting for the Democratic candidate in each election since 1988, as reported by 270towin.\n\nThe 2020 election saw Biden get 60.9% of the vote in the state, while the 2016 election saw Hillary Clinton get 59.0% of the vote against Trump.\n\nHarris was ranked favorably by 53% of New York voters in the poll, compared to 43% who ranked her unfavorably, for a net favorable rating of 10 points.\n\nIn June, Biden was viewed favorably by 42% of voters and unfavorably by 53% of voters.\n\nTrump received a favorable rating of 39%, continuing a trend or rating between 37% and 39% for favorability in each Siena poll from January through July.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nCongress Is Making Huge Investments.

Florida has been mixed in recent years, but Trump's history with the state is expected to help him win the 30 electoral votes.\n\nCheck This Out:\n\nLawmakers Made Huge Investments This Year.

Tim Walz as her vice-presidential running mate in the 2024 presidential election. As conservative pundits on X raced to critique Walz's political record, one such criticism focused around a rather surprising topic: Minnesota's state flag.\n\nAccording to some posts, Walz changed the design of the Minnesota state flag in 2024 to one closely resembling the national flag of Somalia, implying that he had turned Minnesota into some kind of \"New Somalia\" and would do the same to the nation if elected.\n\nThese claims are demonstrably false -- Walz did not change the state flag of Minnesota to resemble that of Somalia. Here's what actually happened:\n\nMinnesota's old flag centered the state's seal, which featured a white settler tilling land and an Indigenous man on horseback, on a blue background. Indigenous Minnesotans, including Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, said the seal and the state flag were insulting to their heritage and attempted to erase the historical record of settler-inflicted violence against Native American groups. Meanwhile, others noted that the old flag broke several principles of \"good flag design\" as published by the North American Vexillological Association.\n\nSo, in 2023, the Minnesota Legislature created a commission to redesign the state flag and seal. According to Minnesota Public Radio, it took 10 attempts in the Legislature to pass a bill calling for a new flag and a new seal. Walz signed that bill into law, but that was the only part he played in creating the new flag.\n\nThe commission received more than 2,500 redesign proposals, both serious and unserious, before choosing its top six designs, then whittling the number down to three, before finally selecting a base design created by Andrew Prekker.\n\nPrekker's design featured a three horizontal stripes of white, green and light blue, with a navy blue stylized outline of Minnesota's shape on the left side of the flag and an eight-pointed star -- a nod to the state's motto, \"L'étoile du Nord,\" French for \"The Star of the North\" -- centered in the outline.\n\nThe commission modified Prekker's design slightly by simplifying the star and removing the horizontal stripes in favor of a field entirely of light blue, representing the water of the so-called \"Land of 10,000 Lakes\" and the headwaters of the Mississippi River. The commission released a comprehensive report on the design that is publicly available, and the new flag was officially flown for the first time on May 11, 2024.\n\nSo where does Somalia play into this? Minnesota is home to more than 60,000 Somali Americans, the largest such community in the nation. And indeed, both flags feature a star and a light blue field. But looking at both flags side by side reveals that they're not very similar.\n\nSomalia's flag features a white, five-pointed star (representing the five Somali homelands) in the center of a light blue background (inspired by the United Nations, which helped Somalia gain independence), while Minnesota's uses an eight-pointed star specifically over the simplified state outline, which is in navy blue.\n\nSure, we admit there are similarities. But the resemblance is purely a coincidence, according to the commission's explanation of the symbols on the flag. The Dispatch, an online publication that openly describes itself as conservative, spoke with a representative from the Minnesota Historical Society, who confirmed that the similarities were coincidental:\n\nThe new Minnesota flag was not designed based on the Somali flag. The designer who submitted the design concept, who is from Luverne, Minnesota, cited many symbols and references of Minnesota as his design inspiration. The Commission further refined the design to represent important features of Minnesota including the North Star, the shape of the State of Minnesota, and blue representing the waters of Minnesota.\n\nFinally, it's not uncommon for flags to look alike -- sometimes much moreso than those of Minnesota and Somalia: Romania and Chad both use a tricolor design of vertical blue, yellow and red bars, while Indonesia and Monaco's flags both are horizontal stripes of red on top of white, for example."],"source":{"uri":["snopes.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Snopes"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://mediaproxy.snopes.com/width/1200/https://media.snopes.com/2024/08/conservatives_on_x_went_after_tim_walz_for_the_minnesota_state_flag.jpg"],"eventUri":["eng-9796289"],"sentiment":[-0.051],"wgt":[460682644],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8262579166"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-06"],"time":["23:19:21"],"dateTime":["2024-08-06T23:19:21Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-06T23:18:34Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.5137],"url":["https://www.dailywire.com/news/flashback-walz-was-in-on-the-biden-cover-up-said-hes-fit-for-office"],"title":["FLASHBACK: Walz Was In On The Biden Cover-Up, Said 'He's Fit For Office'"],"body":["Minnesota Gov.

He said, 'Look,' he didn't listen to himself.\"\n\n\"I think this idea that you get in your own head, you get a little bit cycled up on that,\" he added.

We are not going back,\" he belted, starting a chant from the audience.\n\n\"We've got 91 days. My god, that's easy,\" he said. \"We'll sleep when we're dead.\"\n\nWalz shares his family's personal history with IVF\n\nWalz has made a personal connection with one of the marquee issues in this year's election: in vitro fertilization.\n\nWalz said talking about IVF \"gets personal for me and my family.\"\n\n\"It wasn't by chance that, when we welcomed our daughter into the world, we named her Hope,\" he told the crowd.\n\nAbortion opponents have been increasingly pushing for broader measures that would give rights and protections to embryos and fetuses, which could have massive implications for fertility treatments and other areas of health care.\n\nDemocrats routinely cite IVF concerns as part of a larger problem where women in some states are getting worse medical care since the fall of Roe vs. Wade, linking delayed IVF care to cases in states with abortion restrictions, where women must wait until they are very sick in order to get care.\n\nHe may be Minnesota's governor, but he's still a Nebraska native\n\nWalz sometimes talks about his native state of Nebraska more than the one he leads. He spoke about West Point, Nebraska, the \"small town of 400\" where he was born, and where he spent \"the summers working on the family farm.\"\n\n\"My mom and dad taught us to show generosity towards our neighbors and work for a common good,\" he added.\n\nWalz takes the stage\n\nWalz began his remarks by thanking Harris for selecting him. The campaigner known as being upbeat said, \"Thank you for bringing back the joy!\"\n\nFollowing a shoutout to Gov. Josh Shapiro, Walz praised his wife, a 29-year public school teacher, wryly plugging a key constituency, \"Don't ever underestimate teachers.\"\n\nDifferent backgrounds\n\nHarris noted her and Walz's different backgrounds: She's from Oakland and he's from Nebraska, but they have common ideals. \"After all, the promise of America is what makes it possible for two middle-class kids,\" Harris said, \"to make it all the way to the White House.\"\n\n\"Coach Walz and I may come from different corners of our country,\" she said, \"but we believe in picking people up not knocking them down.\"\n\nAnd without naming Vance, Harris argued for the superiority of her running mate's experience over his GOP rival, using a sports analogy as the former football coach stood by. Saying Walz would be \"ready on day one,\" Harris characterized the race between her running mate and Vance as \"a matchup between the varsity team and the JV squad.\"\n\nHarris campaign rakes in over $20 million\n\nHarris' selection of Walz as her running mate has been another fundraising boon for the Democratic presidential ticket.\n\nHer campaign announced shortly before 6:30 p.m. that it has raised more than $20 million since the vice president unveiled the Minnesota governor as her running mate.\n\nThe Harris campaign has seen a surge in fundraising since she took over the top of the ticket, raising more than $310 million in July. Well over $200 million of that total came after Harris took over top billing from President Joe Biden on July 21.\n\nWalz is certified by the DNC\n\nAs Walz took the stage with Harris in Philadelphia, his status as Democrat's No. 2 for the general election was announced as official.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison and Minyon Moore, chair of Democrats' upcoming convention, said in a statement that Harris and Walz had been certified as their party's nominees.\n\nLate Monday night, Harris officially secured the delegates needed to become her party's presidential nominee. Hours later, she named Walz as her running mate.\n\nHarris highlights Walz's political record\n\nHarris ticked through Walz's record as Minnesota governor, saying he supports her goal of fighting for the middle class.\n\nWalz was the first governor in the country to sign a law enshrining abortion as a right, she said. She noted paid leave for women and voting rights.\n\nBut the biggest applause of the list came when Harris noted Walz's move to provide meals to all public school students.\n\n\"He refused to let students go hungry,\" she said. \"So, he made school breakfast and lunch free for every child.\"\n\nHarris also pointed out that her new running mate \"is a hunter and a gun owner too,\" then immediately noting that as governor Walz \"expanded background checks and increased penalties for illegal firearm sales.\"\n\nHarris highlights Walz's teaching credentials\n\n\"Under those Friday night lights Coach Walz motivated his players,\" Harris said referring to his time as high school football coach, \"Going from a winless record to the school's first-ever state championship.\"\n\nShe went on to note how as football coach he helped start the school's gay-straight alliance \"because he's the kind of person who makes them feel like they belong,\" she said.\n\n\"That's the kind of vice president he's going to be and that's the kind of vice president America deserves.\"\n\nSergeant major, congressman, coach\n\nHarris introduced Walz as \"more than a governor\" by running through the titles he's held over the years.\n\nBeyond that of husband and father, Harris said he was \"Sergeant Major Walz\" to his fellow veterans, \"Congressman\" to voters of southern Minnesota, \"Mr. Walz\" to the high school students he used to teach and \"Coach\" to the football players he coached.\n\n\"And in 91 days, the nation will know Coach Walz by another name: vice president of the United States,\" Harris said to cheers.\n\nHarris frames Walz as the partner she's been looking for\n\nHarris took the stage in Philadelphia for the first time as the Democratic presidential nominee Tuesday, amid raucous cheers in an auditorium on the campus of Temple University.\n\nBut her intro was serious.\n\n\"We need to move to the general election and win that,\" she said. \"We also need to level set. We are the underdogs in this race, but we have the momentum and I know exactly what we're up against.\"\n\nIn preparing to hand off to Walz, Harris is building him up as the partner she had been looking for during her quick search for a running mate.\n\n\"I set out to find a partner who can help build this brighter future, a leader that will help unite our nation and move us forward,\" she said.\n\n\"Pennsylvania, I'm here today because I found such a leader, Gov. Tim Walz of the great state of Minnesota.\"\n\nHarris and Walz take the stage\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has made her first appearance with her newly chosen running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nHarris and Walz have taken the stage together at a packed rally in Philadelphia. The pair ignited sustained cheers as they appeared before thousands at Temple University's Liacouras Center.\n\nWalz, the 60-year-old governor and former U.S. House member from rural south central Minnesota, put his hands together and bowed to the crowd. He stood alongside Harris as she waved to the audience and put her hand over her heart, wrapping the other around Walz.\n\nAccording to excerpts provided by the campaign, Walz plans to use his speech to say that Minnesota values are American values.\n\nBiden learned about Walz from Harris, not the news\n\n\"He heard it first from the vice president,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at her regular briefing. She said she couldn't \"pinpoint\" exactly where the president was when Harris called on Tuesday morning, but that he was somewhere in the executive mansion.\n\n\"She called him to let him know of her pick,\" Jean-Pierre said.\n\nHarris had sought Biden's advice during her search for a running mate, but Jean-Pierre left it there and declined to get into any specifics.\n\nBiden also spoke with Walz and congratulated him on his selection.\n\nPhiladelphia mayor calls for unity among Democrats\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker, who advocated fiercely but unsuccessfully for her state's governor, Josh Shapiro, to be Harris' running mate now says, \"Our Democratic nominee has spoken and that's it. Period. End of story.\"\n\nAt a rally in her city on Tuesday, Parker urged Pennsylvania Democrats to rally behind Harris' choice. Noting that Republicans and detractors would attempt to divide Democrats over the pick Parker says that the party can't let them.\n\nParker made headlines last week for posting a video praising Harris and Shapiro, which some thought suggested Harris had already picked Shapiro as her running mate. Instead, Harris chose Walz and the pair will appear together for the first time at the Philadelphia rally.\n\nThe last politician to face off against Tim Walz has some advice for JD Vance\n\nDr. Scott Jensen, a physician and former Republican Minnesota state senator, was the last political candidate to run against Walz in a general election but lost by nearly 8 points. Jensen says Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance should be prepared for Walz's fast-talking debate style. He also thinks Walz's appeal in rural areas has been overstated.\n\n\"Tim Walz can talk around a topic extremely effectively. He will give people the impression that he is the candidate of the common, everyday person,\" Jensen said. \"But if you look at the results of the 2022 election, Tim Walz really won the election because of the Twin Cities, Duluth and Rochester.\"\n\nHe also pointed out that in the 2022 governor's race, Walz lost many of the counties in the district he previously represented in Congress.\n\n\"Tim Walz lost the district in which the people who knew him best were offered the opportunity to make a decision about his candidacy,\" Jensen said. \"I think that's telling.\"\n\nTrump will sit for an interview with Elon Musk\n\nTrump says that he will do an interview with billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk next week. Musk endorsed the Republican for president after Trump survived an assassination attempt.\n\n\"ON MONDAY NIGHT I'LL BE DOING A MAJOR INTERVIEW WITH ELON MUSK -- Details to follow!\" Trump posted on his social media network.\n\nHis campaign did not immediately have more details to share.\n\nTrump, a longtime opponent of electric cars, said over the weekend at his rally in Atlanta that he favors electric cars \"for a small slice\" of the population, saying, \"I have to be, you know, because Elon endorsed me very strongly.\" He added: \"So I have no choice.\"\n\nExpect Walz to extol Harris during his first running mate appearance\n\nAhead of a rally in Philadelphia, the Harris campaign has released experts of Walz's prepared remarks where he'll introduce himself to the nation, highlight his support for Harris and emphasize stopping Trump at the ballot.\n\nWalz will say that the vice president \"has fought on the side of the American people\" and \"brings joy to everything she does.\"\n\n\"Minnesota's strength comes from our values -- our commitment to working together, to seeing past our differences, to lending a helping hand,\" Walz plans to tell the rally. \"Donald Trump -- he sees the world differently. He doesn't know the first thing about service -- because he's too busy serving himself.\"\n\nThe phone call that sealed the deal\n\nWearing khakis and a camouflage baseball cap, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz accepted a phone call from Vice President Kamala Harris. The Harris campaign has posted a video of the call on social media.\n\n\"Hi, this is Tim,\" Walz said into his phone.\n\n\"It's Kamala Harris. Good morning, governor,\" the Democratic nominee said with a big smile. \"Listen, I want you to do this with me. Let's do this together. Would you be my running mate?\"\n\n\"I would be honored, madame vice president,\" Walz said.\n\nThe two exchanged pleasantries over the roughly minute-long video and Harris ended the call with an, \"All right, buddy. I'll see you soon. Take care.\"\n\nThe campaign said it has raised more than $10 million from \"grassroots supporters alone\" since Walz became her running mate.\n\nVoter Voices: 'I was open for whoever she picked'\n\nMarnie Fowler, a 44-year-old Philadelphia who works in concert touring, wore a blue T-shirt she recently purchased online that said: \"Childless Cat Lady,\" a reference to remarks by GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance. Farlow said she wanted Walz all along. \"He's America's dad,\" Farlow said. \"Everything he's done in Minnesota aligns with my values.\"\n\nCheryl Pitts, a 77-year-old retired state worker from Sicklerville, New Jersey, said she was \"a little bit\" disappointed that Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro wasn't picked, \"but it won't stop us from voting; it didn't diminish my excitement.\" She called Walz \"a regular kind of guy that I can believe what he says.\"\n\nBernie Strain, 66, wore a shirt he made himself for the rally that said: \"OLD WHITE MEN FOR HARRIS & FREEDOM.\" Strain said he'd met Shapiro through politics but was ready to support whoever Harris selected. \"I was open for whoever she picked,\" he said. \"I was going to support them with both feet.\"\n\nA Republican strategist actually praising Harris' VP pick\n\nMark Campbell is a rare Republican who's publicly praising Harris' choice of Walz, calling it \"a home run.\"\n\nCampbell, a veteran GOP strategist who managed Glenn Youngkin's winning 2021 Virginia governor's campaign, ticked through a number of areas he suggests Walz reinforces Harris, first as an authentic surrogate in the northern battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nAn enlisted Army veteran, \"not officer class,\" Walz is \"plainspoken, folksy in a way that will play well in the burbs and rural areas,\" Cambell said.\n\nHe's \"progressive, but not too far from center,\" he said, and will align with \"Harris on policy 90% of the time.\" Campbell called the selection \"rock steady.\"\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says Walz is a good pick for Harris' running mate\n\nBeshear said it was \"a true honor of a lifetime\" to be considered for Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate and that\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz was a good pick.\n\n\"He is a great friend,\" Beshear told reporters outside his office in the Kentucky Capitol on Tuesday afternoon. \"He'd be an amazing vice president. I am 100% onboard with doing everything I can to elect the Harris-Walz ticket this November.\"\n\nBeshear declined to comment on the process -- when he was interviewed for the job and if he heard from Harris or her team Tuesday morning.\n\nMan who owned rights to HarrisWalz.com says he's sold the domain; declined to name the buyer\n\nJeremy Green Eche, the trademark lawyer who purchased HarrisWalz.com for $8.99 in 2020, sold the domain - and a slate of others linked to Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris - on Tuesday for $15,000, he told The Associated Press shortly after the order was made.\n\nEche declined to say who bought the domains, but said they have \"no obvious connection to either campaign or anything political.\"\n\nHarris selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate Tuesday.\n\nEche bought the rights to the site and others in 2020 when the would-be vice president was in the midst of a primary campaign for president. When he learned Walz was the pick, Eche was particularly excited, both because the Harris supporter liked Walz best out of the men the vice president was considering, and because it meant someone paying his $15,000 asking price was more likely.\n\nNow that the site was sold, however, Eche says he feels glad but odd.\n\n\"I feel strange,\" he said, \"like it happened too soon.\"\n\nThe domains were sold on the website for Eche's start-up, Communer, a forum that allows people to buy and sell domains and trademarks online. Eche said the website will now draw up a domain transfer contract between himself and the buyer.\n\nGroup founded by Republican women opposed to Trump support Walz\n\nA group founded in June by current and former Republican women who oppose Donald Trump for president came out in favor of Walz as Harris' pick, in part for Walz's fiscal measures and policy accomplishments aimed at women.\n\n\"As Governor, he's cut taxes for the middle class while balancing the budget, supported paid family leave so new mothers can be home to care for their children, expanded access to pre-kindergarten, and make sure that no Minnesotan child goes hungry at school,\" a release from Women4U.S. states.\n\nThe group is a federal superPAC whose honorary advisers include former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, former New Hampshire Republican Chair Jennifer Horn and founding editor of The Weekly Standard, Bill Kristol.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi welcomes Walz to the race\n\nSpeaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi welcomed the Minnesotan to what she called the Harris-Walz \"freedom ticket.\"\n\n\"In the Congress, I saw firsthand Tim Walz's leadership, collaborative spirit and effectiveness in bringing people together and getting the job done,\" Pelosi said in a statement.\n\nThe former Democratic House speaker was pivotal in reshaping the presidential race as President Joe Biden stepped aside and she said the field of potential VP candidates \"demonstrated the strength and vitality of the next generation of Democratic leadership.\"\n\nWisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin: 'We're thrilled to see a fellow Midwesterner at the top of the ticket'\n\nIt didn't take Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin long to seize on Harris' selection of Walz as a fundraising tool for her competitive reelection campaign.\n\n\"We're thrilled to see a fellow Midwesterner at the top of the ticket,\" Baldwin said in a fundraising email sent late Tuesday morning.\n\nBaldwin, seeking a third term, is among several incumbent Democratic senators seeking reelection in states viewed as pivotal to the presidential campaign, and where an uptick in enthusiasm since Harris' takeover of Joe Biden's campaign has lifted the party's hope of holding the seat.\n\nBaldwin spoke at Harris' first campaign stop as a candidate last month, an upbeat rally in suburban Milwaukee.\n\n\"Wisconsin has emerged as the tipping point state that will determine who wins the White House and which party controls the Senate,\" Baldwin's email said.\n\nBiden carried Wisconsin in 2020 by fewer than 21,000 votes.\n\nVoto Latino co-founder says Walz as running mate will help energize Latino voters\n\nVoto Latino co-founder and President Maria Teresa Kumar said Walz's selection to the ticket would help energize Latino voters who want a more inclusive democracy.\n\nKumar said in a statement that Walz's \"strong record of defending democracy, protecting voting rights, and standing up for working families in Minnesota aligns perfectly with the values our organization and the Latino community hold dear.\"\n\nShe added that she knows the vice president and governor personally and knows they'll represent a powerful voice for \"progress, equality and opportunity for Latino communities and all Americans.\"\n\nSen. Mark Kelly urges supporters to contribute to the Harris-Walz ticket\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly said he and his wife, former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, will do everything they can to elect Harris and Walz after Kelly was passed over for the Democratic ticket.\n\nKelly sent an email to supporters urging them to contribute to the Harris-Walz ticket.\n\n\"Tim has years of experience representing Minnesota both in the House of Representatives, where he served with Gabby, and as Minnesota's governor,\" Kelly wrote. \"In that time, he has shown up time and time again for working families and I know he'll continue that work in the White House.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the head of GIFFORDS, a gun-control advocacy group founded by Kelly and Giffords, called Walz \"a strong gun safety champion.\"\n\n\"Gun violence is a top concern for Americans this election cycle and we know the Harris-Walz ticket is the only one that will stand up to the gun lobby and save lives,\" said GIFFORDS Executive Director Emma Brown, who managed Kelly's 2022 Senate campaign and was his deputy campaign manager when in his first race two years earlier 2020.\n\nVance blames Harris' policies for drug addiction deaths\n\nVance is aiming to tie what he portrays as Harris' failures along the U.S.-Mexico border to deaths from drug addiction.\n\nVance told several hundred supporters gathered in a South Philadelphia event space that, \"thanks to the policies of Kamala Harris, you've got children who've been orphaned\" when their parents die from drugs.\n\nSeveral Pennsylvanians shared personal stories of how addiction issues have impacted their families.\n\nAs he has over several speeches and interviews in recent weeks, Vance told his own story related to drug addition, noting that his mother has been drug-free for a decade but, as a child, he was \"desperately hoping and praying, Jesus, please let her wake up from this.\"\n\nU.S. government data undercuts the claim that people seeking asylum and other border crossers are responsible for drug trafficking. At a hearing last year, James Mandryck, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection deputy assistant commissioner, said 73% of fentanyl seizures at the border since the previous October were smuggling attempts carried out by U.S. citizens, with the rest being done by Mexican citizens.\n\nBarack and Michelle Obama say Harris 'has chosen an ideal partner'\n\n\"Governor Walz doesn't just have the experience to be vice president, he has the values and the integrity to make us proud,\" the former president and first lady said in a statement.\n\nThey said Walz enacted progressive priorities as Minnesota governor including paid family leave, abortion rights and gun safety measures.\n\n\"But Tim's signature is his ability to talk like a human being and treat everyone with decency and respect,\" the Obamas said.\n\nVance says he tried to get Walz on the phone\n\nThe Republican told reporters aboard his campaign plane Tuesday that he called Walz earlier in the day but \"I left him a voicemail, I didn't get him.\"\n\nIt's not clear if there will be a debate between Vance and Walz. Last week, Trump said he wouldn't take part in an ABC News debate that had been on the books for September because he made that agreement with Biden before the president exited the campaign.\n\nInstead, Trump said he would debate Harris on Sept. 4 on Fox News, but the vice president hasn't agreed to that time or network yet.\n\nPresident Joe Biden calls Harris-Walz ticket 'a powerful voice for working people' and middle class\n\nBiden called on Democrats and all Americans to rally behind them.\n\n\"They will be the strongest defenders of our personal freedoms and our democracy,\" Biden said in a social media post. \"And they will ensure that America continues to lead the world and play its role as the indispensable nation.\"\n\nBiden said choosing a running mate is a party nominee's first major decision and praised Harris' choice. He said he's known Walz for nearly two decades, praising his background as a teacher, football coach and National Guard soldier.\n\n\"Every generation of Americans faces a moment where they are asked to defend American democracy,\" Biden said. \"That moment is now.\"\n\nWhite House Senior Deputy Press Secretary Emilie Simons says Biden and Harris spoke on the phone Tuesday morning ahead of the official announcement that she selected Walz and that Biden spoke with Walz to congratulate him.\n\nVance says Walz pick as running mate 'highlights how radical' Harris is\n\nIn his first public comments since his general election foe was set, JD Vance on Tuesday called Walz a choice that \"highlights how radical Kamala Harris is.\"\n\nIn a gaggle with reporters aboard his campaign plane upon landing in Philadelphia, Vance said Walz \"is a person who listens to the Hamas wing\" of the Democratic Party and \"who wants to make the American people more reliant on garbage energy instead of good American energy.\"\n\nVance is speaking more to reporters in Philadelphia on Tuesday ahead of campaign events across Midwestern battleground states on Wednesday, in a path that somewhat mirrors Harris and Walz's planned trajectory.\n\nFormer colleagues on Capitol Hill appear thrilled with Walz as the VP pick\n\n\"Great choice,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\n\"Having served for years with Tim in the House of Representatives, I can say without reservation: there's no better person Vice President Harris could have picked to run and then govern alongside her,\" said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md.\n\nWalz \"has always put our country first,\" Van Hollen said, and he's excited to campaign for the Harris-Walz ticket for \"a brighter future for all Americans.\"\n\nRep. Mark Takano of California recalled how after Walz beat him during an internal House caucus vote to become the top Democrat on the Veterans Affairs Committee, his colleague \"immediately brought me into the fold because that's the type of leader he is: a collaborative bridge builder.\"\n\nAnd Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, who entered Congress with Walz in 2007, said he \"has always had this very straightforward, direct, open approach to things.\"\n\nWelch described Walz as \"one of these guys in the gym who wouldn't undo his tie\" because it would be faster for him to get back to work.\n\nPolling shows the appeal of Tim Walz's biography\n\nTim Walz's biography as a military veteran and former high school teacher - two broadly trusted professions - may also help him appeal to Americans as he campaigns with Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAbout 9 in 10 U.S. adults say they have a favorable opinion of military veterans, generally, according to an Ipsos poll conducted in 2024. About 8 in 10 say that about school teachers. Both measures are much higher than for government employees or elected officials. Republicans are slightly more likely than Democrats to have a positive view of veterans, while Democrats are a bit more likely to have a favorable opinion of those in a teaching career.\n\nGallup polling from 2022 found that high school teachers are generally held in high regard among Americans for their honesty and ethical standards. About half, 53%, gave them at least a high rating on ethics.\n\nAP VoteCast shows Tim Walz's electoral strengths and weakness in Minnesota\n\nDemocratic nominee Kamala Harris is hoping her VP choice, Tim Walz, will strengthen the Democratic ticket in Midwestern states and among working class voters.\n\nAP VoteCast shows that when Walz was elected Minnesota governor in 2022, he won young voters in the state. He also did well in Minnesota's union households, winning nearly 6 in 10 voters in that group. About half of Minnesota voters, 52%, had a favorable view of Walz, and about 4 in 10 had a negative one.\n\nAnd while Walz lost white voters without a college education in the state, he outperformed Democrats nationwide with this group. He also struggled among white men, a demographic Democrats have sought to win back from President Donald Trump, but did a little better among this group than Democrats nationwide.\n\nHowever, Walz lost among military veteran households in Minnesota in 2022, according to VoteCast.\n\nTim Walz will need to introduce himself to America\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz will need to introduce himself to the vast majority of Americans.\n\nAn ABC News/Ipsos survey conducted before Walz was selected as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, but after vetting began, showed that nearly 9 in 10 U.S. adults did not know enough to have an opinion about him. Among Americans with a view, opinions were split between positive and negative: 6% had a favorable view, and 7% had an unfavorable one.\n\nWalz's lack of a national profile as he joins Harris on the campaign trail extends to his own party. Nearly 9 in 10 Democrats also didn't know enough to have an opinion of Walz in the ABC News/Ipsos poll. One in 10 had a favorable view of him, and just 4% had a negative opinion. He was an unknown figure among most Democrats across the party: those older and younger were similarly likely to not know Walz, as well as white Democrats and non-white Democrats.\n\nFellow Minnesotan Sen. Amy Klobuchar says Walz is 'just unendingly optimistic and joyous'\n\nU.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar says Walz is someone who is \"just unendingly optimistic and joyous, and that is very, very important right now in our politics.\"\n\nThe fellow Minnesotan who served with Walz in Congress told The Associated Press \"he's blunt, but he's also positive\" in a way she believes will provide an upbeat message in contrast to the Trump-Vance Republican ticket.\n\n\"I always think of him in his plaid shirt because he was always making the point it's 'One Minnesota,'\" said Klobuchar, a Democrat. \"And I think that's a point you're going hear him talk about with our nation.\"\n\nShe said his background as a hunter and someone who fishes \"just brings a different perspective to the White House.\"\n\nSeveral black and white SUVs have left the Governor's residence in St. Paul\n\nThe SUVs left amid cheers from residents lined up on the sidewalk.\n\nHarris' running mate pick is good news for man who owns rights to HarrisWalz.com\n\nJeremy Green Eche was in the middle of getting his toddler dressed the moment news broke that Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris had selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate.\n\nAnd he was amped.\n\nEche was uniquely invested in Harris' pick. He currently owns the rights to HarrisWalz.com, a site he bought in 2020 -- along with a slate of other Harris sites -- when the would-be vice president was in the midst of a primary campaign for president. Four years and one vice presidential pick later, Eche is willing to sell the slate of Harris websites, including the one featuring Walz, for $15,000.\n\n\"I was constantly refreshing four different news sites on my phone,\" he told The Associated Press on Tuesday. \"I was very excited.\" He said he \"almost immediately\" began getting calls from both journalists and \"friends I hadn't heard from in a while.\"\n\nThis is not a new scenario for the 36-year-old trademark lawyer in Brooklyn, New York. Eche is a cyber squatter, someone who buys a domain with someone else's name or brand in it for very little money, hoping to sell it to that person or brand for a large profit in the subsequent months or years. In 2011, when it looked likely that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would be the Democratic nominee in 2016, then Jeremy Peter Green - he took his wife's last name - purchased ClintonKaine.com.\n\nAfter the former secretary of state picked Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, the squatter offered it to the campaign for a hefty return. They declined, so he sold it for $15,000 to a digital marketing company that turned out to be the Trump campaign. The website pushed anti-Clinton news with \"Paid for by Donald J. Trump for President, Inc\" emblazoned at the bottom.\n\nEche supported Clinton in 2016 and supports Harris today. The prospect of something like that happening again doesn't give Eche pause, however.\n\n\"The Harris campaign has hundreds of millions of dollars, so if they don't buy their own domain, that is kind of on them,\" he said Monday. But he isn't convinced they will buy the domain.\n\n\"I don't want to be too confident that somebody will reach out,\" he said after Walz was selected. \"I would say there's a 75% chance that one of the campaigns, or a PAC, will buy it from me.\"\n\nWalz says he's 'all in'\n\nIn a Tuesday morning post on X, Walz said joining the ticket with Harris is \"the honor of a lifetime.\"\n\nHis profile details on X are now \"Running to win this thing with @kamalaharris.\"\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro on Walz\n\nShapiro called Walz \"an exceptionally strong addition to the ticket\" who'll help Harris become the 47th president.\n\nShapiro, who met with Harris on Sunday about the job, said he was grateful to talk about \"her vision for the role and the campaign ahead.\"\n\n\"As I've said repeatedly over the past several weeks, the running mate decision was a deeply personal decision for the vice president - and it was also a deeply personal decision for me. Pennsylvanians elected me to a four-year term as their governor, and my work here is far from finished - there is a lot more stuff I want to get done for the good people of this commonwealth,\" Shapiro said in a statement.\n\nHe said he considers Walz a good friend and pledged to travel the state over the next three months to help Democrats defeat former President Donald Trump \"and build a better future for our country.\"\n\n\"Vice President Kamala Harris has my enthusiastic support - and I know that Governor Tim Walz is an exceptionally strong addition to the ticket who will help Kamala move our country forward,\" Shapiro said.\n\nAt the Governor's mansion, a Minnesota resident says why he likes Walz\n\nDavid Ivory, 46, stood outside the Governor's mansion with his two children. Ivory found out Walz was selected after his wife texted him \"OMG\" from work.\n\nHe and his kids immediately hopped on their bikes and rode to the Governor's residence in St. Paul.\n\nIvory and his family are longtime admirers of Walz for his liberal record and amiable political persona.\n\n\"He's just down to earth. He gets it. He can talk to anybody,\" Ivory said. \"He doesn't seem like he's above anybody. He was a teacher. He understands kids, which is very important.\"\n\nHarris says her new running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has 'delivered for working families'\n\n\"It's great to have him on the team,\" Harris said.\n\nHarris posted on X that she was proud to announce she asked Walz to join her on the 2024 ticket.\n\nVoter Coalition Pushes Issue-Based Outreach Strategy to Increase Registration, Shifting from Top of Ticket Politics\n\nState Voices launched a $3 million nationwide campaign Tuesday to encourage voters of color to vote based on the issues that affect their day-to-day lives, like grocery price spikes or growing rent and mortgage payments.\n\nUnder the Vote for Something campaign, the coalition aims to register 800,000 voters, make more than 250 million voter contacts, and encourage 100,000 people to make a plan to vote on or ahead of the 2024 election for themselves and others.\n\nThey've registered more than 400,000 voters so far.\n\nState Voices, like many voting rights advocates, hopes for messaging that transcends the top of the ticket -- a looming match between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\"Whatever the issue is that matters to you, vote for something. Get out this November and bring a friend and a family member with you,\" said Mishara Davis, the group's director of issue and electoral organizing.\n\nThe key has been reaching voters who may be tired of the political space altogether or who are eligible to vote but aren't registered and therefore may not receive voting information -- especially in presidential swing states, Georgia, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, which are primary areas under the campaign.\n\nThis comes as Harris, who is in Pennsylvania this week, has chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, sources say. The pair will continue the campaign tour to Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada starting Wednesday.\n\nEnvironmental group cheers selection of Walz as the Democratic vice presidential candidate\n\nManish Bapna, president and CEO of the NRDC Action Fund, the political arm of the Natural Resources Defense Council, called Harris and Walz \"the winning ticket on climate. The Harris-Walz administration will be ready, on day one, to build on the strongest climate action ever and lead by example in the global fight against the existential challenge of our time.''\n\nWalz has made Minnesota a national climate leader, Bapna said. Under his leadership, the state committed to 100% clean energy by 2040, and Minnesota was the first Midwestern state to adopt California's strict tailpipe emissions standards. Walz also signed a bill last year directing $240 million to replace lead service water lines statewide.\n\n\"The stakes in this election couldn't be higher nor the choice more clear. Trump would bow to billionaire oil and gas donors, slam climate progress into reverse and leave our kids to pay the price. Harris is a proven climate and justice leader with two decades of public service on the front lines of needed progress and change. She's shown us what leadership looks like, and she's earned the chance to lead,\" Bapna said.\n\nThe National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund praises Walz's selection\n\n\"The National LGBTQ Action Fund expected a strategic and bold choice as a strong addition to the ticket as a Vice-Presidential candidate,\" Sayre E. Reece, vice president of the National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, said Tuesday in a statement. \"In Governor Walz we have gotten both.\"\n\nReece continued: \"Governor Walz has been a steadfast ally and advocate for the LGBTQ community, including support for trans affirming care, bodily autonomy and reproductive freedom and gun control. As Governor, Walz signed a ban on so-called 'conversion therapy' into law, ending the harmful and cruel practice that has cost LGBTQ people their dignity and their lives. Under Walz's leadership, Minnesota is both a 'trans sanctuary' and immigration sanctuary state.\"\n\nThe National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund describes itself as lobbying for legislation and ballot initiatives that \"achieve justice\" for LGBTQ people.\n\nAt Walz's residence in Minnesota\n\nA growing crowd of residents and news reporters gathered outside Walz's residence in St. Paul, Minnesota, on Tuesday morning.\n\nBlack and white SUVs periodically pulled into the driveway as onlookers waited to catch a glimpse of Walz leaving the 20-room governor's mansion near the Mississippi River.\n\nNo immediate comment from Vance on Harris picking Walz as her running mate\n\nBoarding his campaign plane Tuesday morning in Cincinnati for a swing through battleground states this week, Ohio Sen. JD Vance did not answer shouted questions about Harris picking Walz as her running mate.\n\nOn Tuesday, Vance was heading to Pennsylvania, where Harris planned to debut with her new running mate later in the day.\n\nTrump attacks Walz in a fundraising email\n\nDonald Trump sent a fundraising email calling Walz \"Dangerously Liberal\" and saying he would \"unleash HELL ON EARTH.\"\n\nMoments after Harris' VP pick became public, the former president and Republican nominee said Walz would be the worst vice president in history, claiming the Minnesota governor would \"light TRILLIONS of dollars on fire\" and open U.S. borders to criminals.\n\n\"HE'S THAT BAD,\" the email says.\n\nThe selection process that led Harris to pick Walz as her running mate\n\nA team of lawyers and political operatives led by former attorney general Eric Holder pored over documents and conducted interviews with potential vice presidential selections.\n\nAnd Harris herself met with her three finalists on Sunday. She mulled the decision over Monday with top aides at the vice president's residence in Washington and finalized it Tuesday morning.\n\nWalz emerged as the choice.\n\nA Minnesota Democratic strategist praises Walz's ability to connect with voters\n\nMinnesota Democratic strategist Abu Amara says Walz will be a good surrogate for Harris across the upper Midwest, because he represented a rural U.S. House district but won statewide in a state with large metropolitan and suburban areas.\n\n\"He's not trying to speak in poetry. He speaks in practicality,\" Amara said. \"That's a level of accessibility for so many voters.\"\n\n\"He has the ability to connect with rural, suburban and urban voters,\" he said.\n\nSome Republicans are already reacting to the selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as Harris' VP pick\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis called it the \"most left-wing ticket in American history\" and accused Walz of not doing enough to protect Minnesota during the 2020 protests over the killing of George Floyd.\n\nHe said \"Walz sat by and let Minneapolis burn.\"\n\nTropical Storm Debby continues to upend Harris' travel plans this week\n\nThe campaign had already pulled down a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, because of the weather.\n\nBut the Democratic presidential nominee will now no longer travel to Raleigh, North Carolina, either, according to the campaign. She was set to travel to Raleigh on Thursday.\n\nHarris is launching a tour of battleground states on Tuesday evening, starting in Philadelphia.\n\nHarris picks Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as running mate, AP sources say\n\nVice President Kamala Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday. That's according to three people who spoke to The Associated Press.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she's turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families. The people were not authorized to speak publicly about the choice and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has decided on a running mate and an announcement is expected in the coming hours before the two appear together at a Philadelphia rally, according to three people familiar with her decision.\n\nIn recent days, she has zeroed in on a trio of potential finalists: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

It said it would next formally certify the vote before holding a celebratory roll call at the party's convention later this month in Chicago.\n\nHarris' coronation as her party's standard-bearer caps a tumultuous and frenetic period for Democrats prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous June debate performance.\n\nAs soon as Biden abruptly ended his candidacy, Harris and her team worked rapidly to secure backing from the 1,976 party delegates needed to clinch the nomination in a formal roll call vote. She reached that marker at warp speed, with an Associated Press survey of delegates nationwide showing she locked down the necessary commitments a mere 32 hours after Biden's announcement."],"source":{"uri":["independent.co.uk"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["The Independent"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/07/00/Election_2024_Harris_03171.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"],"eventUri":["eng-9795783"],"sentiment":[0.2157],"wgt":[460681648],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8262566157"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-06"],"time":["23:03:45"],"dateTime":["2024-08-06T23:03:45Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-06T23:03:01Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2024/08/06/fact-focus-false-claims-follow-minnesota-governors-selection-as-harris-running-mate/"],"title":["FACT FOCUS: False claims follow Minnesota governor's selection as Harris' running mate"],"body":["Vice President Kamala Harris' announcement on Tuesday that Minnesota Gov.

Tim Walz as her running mate, looking to strengthen the Democratic ticket in Midwestern states.\n\nShe introduced Walz at a rally Tuesday evening in Philadelphia.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a deadline last week. She officially claimed the nomination Monday night when the DNC released final results.\n\nFollow the AP's Election-2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nHarris highlights Walz's teaching credentials\n\n\"Under those Friday night lights Coach Walz motivated his players,\" Harris said referring to his time as high school football coach, \"Going from a winless record to the school's first-ever state championship.\"\n\nShe went on to note how as football coach he helped start the school's gay-straight alliance \"because he's the kind of person who makes them feel like they belong,\" she said.\n\n\"That's the kind of vice president he's going to be and that's the kind of vice president America deserves.\"\n\nSergeant major, congressman, coach\n\nHarris introduced Walz as \"more than a governor\" by running through the titles he's held over the years.\n\nBeyond that of husband and father, Harris said he was \"Sergeant Major Walz\" to his fellow veterans, \"Congressman\" to voters of southern Minnesota, \"Mr. Walz\" to the high school students he used to teach and \"Coach\" to the football players he coached.\n\n\"And in 91 days, the nation will know Coach Walz by another name: vice president of the United States,\" Harris said to cheers.\n\nHarris frames Walz as the partner she's been looking for\n\nHarris took the stage in Philadelphia for the first time as the Democratic presidential nominee Tuesday, amid raucous cheers in an auditorium on the campus of Temple University.\n\nBut her intro was serious.\n\n\"We need to move to the general election and win that,\" she said. \"We also need to level set. We are the underdogs in this race, but we have the momentum and I know exactly what we're up against.\"\n\nIn preparing to hand off to Walz, Harris is building him up as the partner she had been looking for during her quick search for a running mate.\n\n\"I set out to find a partner who can help build this brighter future, a leader that will help unite our nation and move us forward,\" she said.\n\n\"Pennsylvania, I'm here today because I found such a leader, Gov. Tim Walz of the great state of Minnesota.\"\n\nHarris and Walz take the stage\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has made her first appearance with her newly chosen running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nHarris and Walz have taken the stage together at a packed rally in Philadelphia. The pair ignited sustained cheers as they appeared before thousands at Temple University's Liacouras Center.\n\nWalz, the 60-year-old governor and former U.S. House member from rural south central Minnesota, put his hands together and bowed to the crowd. He stood alongside Harris as she waved to the audience and put her hand over her heart, wrapping the other around Walz.\n\nAccording to excerpts provided by the campaign, Walz plans to use his speech to say that Minnesota values are American values.\n\nBiden learned about Walz from Harris, not the news\n\n\"He heard it first from the vice president,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at her regular briefing. She said she couldn't \"pinpoint\" exactly where the president was when Harris called on Tuesday morning, but that he was somewhere in the executive mansion.\n\n\"She called him to let him know of her pick,\" Jean-Pierre said.\n\nHarris had sought Biden's advice during her search for a running mate, but Jean-Pierre left it there and declined to get into any specifics.\n\nBiden also spoke with Walz and congratulated him on his selection.\n\nPhiladelphia mayor calls for unity among Democrats\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker, who advocated fiercely but unsuccessfully for her state's governor, Josh Shapiro, to be Harris' running mate now says, \"Our Democratic nominee has spoken and that's it. Period. End of story.\"\n\nAt a rally in her city on Tuesday, Parker urged Pennsylvania Democrats to rally behind Harris' choice. Noting that Republicans and detractors would attempt to divide Democrats over the pick Parker says that the party can't let them.\n\nParker made headlines last week for posting a video praising Harris and Shapiro, which some thought suggested Harris had already picked Shapiro as her running mate. Instead, Harris chose Walz and the pair will appear together for the first time at the Philadelphia rally.\n\nThe last politician to face off against Tim Walz has some advice for JD Vance\n\nDr. Scott Jensen, a physician and former Republican Minnesota state senator, was the last political candidate to run against Walz in a general election but lost by nearly 8 points. Jensen says Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance should be prepared for Walz's fast-talking debate style. He also thinks Walz's appeal in rural areas has been overstated.\n\n\"Tim Walz can talk around a topic extremely effectively. He will give people the impression that he is the candidate of the common, everyday person,\" Jensen said. \"But if you look at the results of the 2022 election, Tim Walz really won the election because of the Twin Cities, Duluth and Rochester.\"\n\nHe also pointed out that in the 2022 governor's race, Walz lost many of the counties in the district he previously represented in Congress.\n\n\"Tim Walz lost the district in which the people who knew him best were offered the opportunity to make a decision about his candidacy,\" Jensen said. \"I think that's telling.\"\n\nTrump will sit for an interview with Elon Musk\n\nTrump says that he will do an interview with billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk next week. Musk endorsed the Republican for president after Trump survived an assassination attempt.\n\n\"ON MONDAY NIGHT I'LL BE DOING A MAJOR INTERVIEW WITH ELON MUSK -- Details to follow!\" Trump posted on his social media network.\n\nHis campaign did not immediately have more details to share.\n\nTrump, a longtime opponent of electric cars, said over the weekend at his rally in Atlanta that he favors electric cars \"for a small slice\" of the population, saying, \"I have to be, you know, because Elon endorsed me very strongly.\" He added: \"So I have no choice.\"\n\nExpect Walz to extol Harris during his first running mate appearance\n\nAhead of a rally in Philadelphia, the Harris campaign has released experts of Walz's prepared remarks where he'll introduce himself to the nation, highlight his support for Harris and emphasize stopping Trump at the ballot.\n\nWalz will say that the vice president \"has fought on the side of the American people\" and \"brings joy to everything she does.\"\n\n\"Minnesota's strength comes from our values -- our commitment to working together, to seeing past our differences, to lending a helping hand,\" Walz plans to tell the rally. \"Donald Trump -- he sees the world differently. He doesn't know the first thing about service -- because he's too busy serving himself.\"\n\nThe phone call that sealed the deal\n\nWearing khakis and a camouflage baseball cap, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz accepted a phone call from Vice President Kamala Harris. The Harris campaign has posted a video of the call on social media.\n\n\"Hi, this is Tim,\" Walz said into his phone.\n\n\"It's Kamala Harris. Good morning, governor,\" the Democratic nominee said with a big smile. \"Listen, I want you to do this with me. Let's do this together. Would you be my running mate?\"\n\n\"I would be honored, madame vice president,\" Walz said.\n\nThe two exchanged pleasantries over the roughly minute-long video and Harris ended the call with an, \"All right, buddy. I'll see you soon. Take care.\"\n\nThe campaign said it has raised more than $10 million from \"grassroots supporters alone\" since Walz became her running mate.\n\nVoter Voices: 'I was open for whoever she picked'\n\nMarnie Fowler, a 44-year-old Philadelphia who works in concert touring, wore a blue T-shirt she recently purchased online that said: \"Childless Cat Lady,\" a reference to remarks by GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance. Farlow said she wanted Walz all along. \"He's America's dad,\" Farlow said. \"Everything he's done in Minnesota aligns with my values.\"\n\nCheryl Pitts, a 77-year-old retired state worker from Sicklerville, New Jersey, said she was \"a little bit\" disappointed that Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro wasn't picked, \"but it won't stop us from voting; it didn't diminish my excitement.\" She called Walz \"a regular kind of guy that I can believe what he says.\"\n\nBernie Strain, 66, wore a shirt he made himself for the rally that said: \"OLD WHITE MEN FOR HARRIS & FREEDOM.\" Strain said he'd met Shapiro through politics but was ready to support whoever Harris selected. \"I was open for whoever she picked,\" he said. \"I was going to support them with both feet.\"\n\nA Republican strategist actually praising Harris' VP pick\n\nMark Campbell is a rare Republican who's publicly praising Harris' choice of Walz, calling it \"a home run.\"\n\nCampbell, a veteran GOP strategist who managed Glenn Youngkin's winning 2021 Virginia governor's campaign, ticked through a number of areas he suggests Walz reinforces Harris, first as an authentic surrogate in the northern battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nAn enlisted Army veteran, \"not officer class,\" Walz is \"plainspoken, folksy in a way that will play well in the burbs and rural areas,\" Cambell said.\n\nHe's \"progressive, but not too far from center,\" he said, and will align with \"Harris on policy 90% of the time.\" Campbell called the selection \"rock steady.\"\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says Walz is a good pick for Harris' running mate\n\nBeshear said it was \"a true honor of a lifetime\" to be considered for Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate and that\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz was a good pick.\n\n\"He is a great friend,\" Beshear told reporters outside his office in the Kentucky Capitol on Tuesday afternoon. \"He'd be an amazing vice president. I am 100% onboard with doing everything I can to elect the Harris-Walz ticket this November.\"\n\nBeshear declined to comment on the process -- when he was interviewed for the job and if he heard from Harris or her team Tuesday morning.\n\nMan who owned rights to HarrisWalz.com says he's sold the domain; declined to name the buyer\n\nJeremy Green Eche, the trademark lawyer who purchased HarrisWalz.com for $8.99 in 2020, sold the domain - and a slate of others linked to Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris - on Tuesday for $15,000, he told The Associated Press shortly after the order was made.\n\nEche declined to say who bought the domains, but said they have \"no obvious connection to either campaign or anything political.\"\n\nHarris selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate Tuesday.\n\nEche bought the rights to the site and others in 2020 when the would-be vice president was in the midst of a primary campaign for president. When he learned Walz was the pick, Eche was particularly excited, both because the Harris supporter liked Walz best out of the men the vice president was considering, and because it meant someone paying his $15,000 asking price was more likely.\n\nNow that the site was sold, however, Eche says he feels glad but odd.\n\n\"I feel strange,\" he said, \"like it happened too soon.\"\n\nThe domains were sold on the website for Eche's start-up, Communer, a forum that allows people to buy and sell domains and trademarks online. Eche said the website will now draw up a domain transfer contract between himself and the buyer.\n\nGroup founded by Republican women opposed to Trump support Walz\n\nA group founded in June by current and former Republican women who oppose Donald Trump for president came out in favor of Walz as Harris' pick, in part for Walz's fiscal measures and policy accomplishments aimed at women.\n\n\"As Governor, he's cut taxes for the middle class while balancing the budget, supported paid family leave so new mothers can be home to care for their children, expanded access to pre-kindergarten, and make sure that no Minnesotan child goes hungry at school,\" a release from Women4U.S. states.\n\nThe group is a federal superPAC whose honorary advisers include former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, former New Hampshire Republican Chair Jennifer Horn and founding editor of The Weekly Standard, Bill Kristol.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi welcomes Walz to the race\n\nSpeaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi welcomed the Minnesotan to what she called the Harris-Walz \"freedom ticket.\"\n\n\"In the Congress, I saw firsthand Tim Walz's leadership, collaborative spirit and effectiveness in bringing people together and getting the job done,\" Pelosi said in a statement.\n\nThe former Democratic House speaker was pivotal in reshaping the presidential race as President Joe Biden stepped aside and she said the field of potential VP candidates \"demonstrated the strength and vitality of the next generation of Democratic leadership.\"\n\nWisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin: 'We're thrilled to see a fellow Midwesterner at the top of the ticket'\n\nIt didn't take Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin long to seize on Harris' selection of Walz as a fundraising tool for her competitive reelection campaign.\n\n\"We're thrilled to see a fellow Midwesterner at the top of the ticket,\" Baldwin said in a fundraising email sent late Tuesday morning.\n\nBaldwin, seeking a third term, is among several incumbent Democratic senators seeking reelection in states viewed as pivotal to the presidential campaign, and where an uptick in enthusiasm since Harris' takeover of Joe Biden's campaign has lifted the party's hope of holding the seat.\n\nBaldwin spoke at Harris' first campaign stop as a candidate last month, an upbeat rally in suburban Milwaukee.\n\n\"Wisconsin has emerged as the tipping point state that will determine who wins the White House and which party controls the Senate,\" Baldwin's email said.\n\nBiden carried Wisconsin in 2020 by fewer than 21,000 votes.\n\nVoto Latino co-founder says Walz as running mate will help energize Latino voters\n\nVoto Latino co-founder and President Maria Teresa Kumar said Walz's selection to the ticket would help energize Latino voters who want a more inclusive democracy.\n\nKumar said in a statement that Walz's \"strong record of defending democracy, protecting voting rights, and standing up for working families in Minnesota aligns perfectly with the values our organization and the Latino community hold dear.\"\n\nShe added that she knows the vice president and governor personally and knows they'll represent a powerful voice for \"progress, equality and opportunity for Latino communities and all Americans.\"\n\nSen. Mark Kelly urges supporters to contribute to the Harris-Walz ticket\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly said he and his wife, former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, will do everything they can to elect Harris and Walz after Kelly was passed over for the Democratic ticket.\n\nKelly sent an email to supporters urging them to contribute to the Harris-Walz ticket.\n\n\"Tim has years of experience representing Minnesota both in the House of Representatives, where he served with Gabby, and as Minnesota's governor,\" Kelly wrote. \"In that time, he has shown up time and time again for working families and I know he'll continue that work in the White House.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the head of GIFFORDS, a gun-control advocacy group founded by Kelly and Giffords, called Walz \"a strong gun safety champion.\"\n\n\"Gun violence is a top concern for Americans this election cycle and we know the Harris-Walz ticket is the only one that will stand up to the gun lobby and save lives,\" said GIFFORDS Executive Director Emma Brown, who managed Kelly's 2022 Senate campaign and was his deputy campaign manager when in his first race two years earlier 2020.\n\nVance blames Harris' policies for drug addiction deaths\n\nVance is aiming to tie what he portrays as Harris' failures along the U.S.-Mexico border to deaths from drug addiction.\n\nVance told several hundred supporters gathered in a South Philadelphia event space that, \"thanks to the policies of Kamala Harris, you've got children who've been orphaned\" when their parents die from drugs.\n\nSeveral Pennsylvanians shared personal stories of how addiction issues have impacted their families.\n\nAs he has over several speeches and interviews in recent weeks, Vance told his own story related to drug addition, noting that his mother has been drug-free for a decade but, as a child, he was \"desperately hoping and praying, Jesus, please let her wake up from this.\"\n\nU.S. government data undercuts the claim that people seeking asylum and other border crossers are responsible for drug trafficking. At a hearing last year, James Mandryck, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection deputy assistant commissioner, said 73% of fentanyl seizures at the border since the previous October were smuggling attempts carried out by U.S. citizens, with the rest being done by Mexican citizens.\n\nBarack and Michelle Obama say Harris 'has chosen an ideal partner'\n\n\"Governor Walz doesn't just have the experience to be vice president, he has the values and the integrity to make us proud,\" the former president and first lady said in a statement.\n\nThey said Walz enacted progressive priorities as Minnesota governor including paid family leave, abortion rights and gun safety measures.\n\n\"But Tim's signature is his ability to talk like a human being and treat everyone with decency and respect,\" the Obamas said.\n\nVance says he tried to get Walz on the phone\n\nThe Republican told reporters aboard his campaign plane Tuesday that he called Walz earlier in the day but \"I left him a voicemail, I didn't get him.\"\n\nIt's not clear if there will be a debate between Vance and Walz. Last week, Trump said he wouldn't take part in an ABC News debate that had been on the books for September because he made that agreement with Biden before the president exited the campaign.\n\nInstead, Trump said he would debate Harris on Sept. 4 on Fox News, but the vice president hasn't agreed to that time or network yet.\n\nPresident Joe Biden calls Harris-Walz ticket 'a powerful voice for working people' and middle class\n\nBiden called on Democrats and all Americans to rally behind them.\n\n\"They will be the strongest defenders of our personal freedoms and our democracy,\" Biden said in a social media post. \"And they will ensure that America continues to lead the world and play its role as the indispensable nation.\"\n\nBiden said choosing a running mate is a party nominee's first major decision and praised Harris' choice. He said he's known Walz for nearly two decades, praising his background as a teacher, football coach and National Guard soldier.\n\n\"Every generation of Americans faces a moment where they are asked to defend American democracy,\" Biden said. \"That moment is now.\"\n\nWhite House Senior Deputy Press Secretary Emilie Simons says Biden and Harris spoke on the phone Tuesday morning ahead of the official announcement that she selected Walz and that Biden spoke with Walz to congratulate him.\n\nVance says Walz pick as running mate 'highlights how radical' Harris is\n\nIn his first public comments since his general election foe was set, JD Vance on Tuesday called Walz a choice that \"highlights how radical Kamala Harris is.\"\n\nIn a gaggle with reporters aboard his campaign plane upon landing in Philadelphia, Vance said Walz \"is a person who listens to the Hamas wing\" of the Democratic Party and \"who wants to make the American people more reliant on garbage energy instead of good American energy.\"\n\nVance is speaking more to reporters in Philadelphia on Tuesday ahead of campaign events across Midwestern battleground states on Wednesday, in a path that somewhat mirrors Harris and Walz's planned trajectory.\n\nFormer colleagues on Capitol Hill appear thrilled with Walz as the VP pick\n\n\"Great choice,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\n\"Having served for years with Tim in the House of Representatives, I can say without reservation: there's no better person Vice President Harris could have picked to run and then govern alongside her,\" said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md.\n\nWalz \"has always put our country first,\" Van Hollen said, and he's excited to campaign for the Harris-Walz ticket for \"a brighter future for all Americans.\"\n\nRep. Mark Takano of California recalled how after Walz beat him during an internal House caucus vote to become the top Democrat on the Veterans Affairs Committee, his colleague \"immediately brought me into the fold because that's the type of leader he is: a collaborative bridge builder.\"\n\nAnd Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, who entered Congress with Walz in 2007, said he \"has always had this very straightforward, direct, open approach to things.\"\n\nWelch described Walz as \"one of these guys in the gym who wouldn't undo his tie\" because it would be faster for him to get back to work.\n\nPolling shows the appeal of Tim Walz's biography\n\nTim Walz's biography as a military veteran and former high school teacher - two broadly trusted professions - may also help him appeal to Americans as he campaigns with Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAbout 9 in 10 U.S. adults say they have a favorable opinion of military veterans, generally, according to an Ipsos poll conducted in 2024. About 8 in 10 say that about school teachers. Both measures are much higher than for government employees or elected officials. Republicans are slightly more likely than Democrats to have a positive view of veterans, while Democrats are a bit more likely to have a favorable opinion of those in a teaching career.\n\nGallup polling from 2022 found that high school teachers are generally held in high regard among Americans for their honesty and ethical standards. About half, 53%, gave them at least a high rating on ethics.\n\nAP VoteCast shows Tim Walz's electoral strengths and weakness in Minnesota\n\nDemocratic nominee Kamala Harris is hoping her VP choice, Tim Walz, will strengthen the Democratic ticket in Midwestern states and among working class voters.\n\nAP VoteCast shows that when Walz was elected Minnesota governor in 2022, he won young voters in the state. He also did well in Minnesota's union households, winning nearly 6 in 10 voters in that group. About half of Minnesota voters, 52%, had a favorable view of Walz, and about 4 in 10 had a negative one.\n\nAnd while Walz lost white voters without a college education in the state, he outperformed Democrats nationwide with this group. He also struggled among white men, a demographic Democrats have sought to win back from President Donald Trump, but did a little better among this group than Democrats nationwide.\n\nHowever, Walz lost among military veteran households in Minnesota in 2022, according to VoteCast.\n\nTim Walz will need to introduce himself to America\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz will need to introduce himself to the vast majority of Americans.\n\nAn ABC News/Ipsos survey conducted before Walz was selected as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, but after vetting began, showed that nearly 9 in 10 U.S. adults did not know enough to have an opinion about him. Among Americans with a view, opinions were split between positive and negative: 6% had a favorable view, and 7% had an unfavorable one.\n\nWalz's lack of a national profile as he joins Harris on the campaign trail extends to his own party. Nearly 9 in 10 Democrats also didn't know enough to have an opinion of Walz in the ABC News/Ipsos poll. One in 10 had a favorable view of him, and just 4% had a negative opinion. He was an unknown figure among most Democrats across the party: those older and younger were similarly likely to not know Walz, as well as white Democrats and non-white Democrats.\n\nFellow Minnesotan Sen. Amy Klobuchar says Walz is 'just unendingly optimistic and joyous'\n\nU.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar says Walz is someone who is \"just unendingly optimistic and joyous, and that is very, very important right now in our politics.\"\n\nThe fellow Minnesotan who served with Walz in Congress told The Associated Press \"he's blunt, but he's also positive\" in a way she believes will provide an upbeat message in contrast to the Trump-Vance Republican ticket.\n\n\"I always think of him in his plaid shirt because he was always making the point it's 'One Minnesota,'\" said Klobuchar, a Democrat. \"And I think that's a point you're going hear him talk about with our nation.\"\n\nShe said his background as a hunter and someone who fishes \"just brings a different perspective to the White House.\"\n\nSeveral black and white SUVs have left the Governor's residence in St. Paul\n\nThe SUVs left amid cheers from residents lined up on the sidewalk.\n\nHarris' running mate pick is good news for man who owns rights to HarrisWalz.com\n\nJeremy Green Eche was in the middle of getting his toddler dressed the moment news broke that Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris had selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate.\n\nAnd he was amped.\n\nEche was uniquely invested in Harris' pick. He currently owns the rights to HarrisWalz.com, a site he bought in 2020 -- along with a slate of other Harris sites -- when the would-be vice president was in the midst of a primary campaign for president. Four years and one vice presidential pick later, Eche is willing to sell the slate of Harris websites, including the one featuring Walz, for $15,000.\n\n\"I was constantly refreshing four different news sites on my phone,\" he told The Associated Press on Tuesday. \"I was very excited.\" He said he \"almost immediately\" began getting calls from both journalists and \"friends I hadn't heard from in a while.\"\n\nThis is not a new scenario for the 36-year-old trademark lawyer in Brooklyn, New York. Eche is a cyber squatter, someone who buys a domain with someone else's name or brand in it for very little money, hoping to sell it to that person or brand for a large profit in the subsequent months or years. In 2011, when it looked likely that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would be the Democratic nominee in 2016, then Jeremy Peter Green - he took his wife's last name - purchased ClintonKaine.com.\n\nAfter the former secretary of state picked Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, the squatter offered it to the campaign for a hefty return. They declined, so he sold it for $15,000 to a digital marketing company that turned out to be the Trump campaign. The website pushed anti-Clinton news with \"Paid for by Donald J. Trump for President, Inc\" emblazoned at the bottom.\n\nEche supported Clinton in 2016 and supports Harris today. The prospect of something like that happening again doesn't give Eche pause, however.\n\n\"The Harris campaign has hundreds of millions of dollars, so if they don't buy their own domain, that is kind of on them,\" he said Monday. But he isn't convinced they will buy the domain.\n\n\"I don't want to be too confident that somebody will reach out,\" he said after Walz was selected. \"I would say there's a 75% chance that one of the campaigns, or a PAC, will buy it from me.\"\n\nWalz says he's 'all in'\n\nIn a Tuesday morning post on X, Walz said joining the ticket with Harris is \"the honor of a lifetime.\"\n\nHis profile details on X are now \"Running to win this thing with @kamalaharris.\"\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro on Walz\n\nShapiro called Walz \"an exceptionally strong addition to the ticket\" who'll help Harris become the 47th president.\n\nShapiro, who met with Harris on Sunday about the job, said he was grateful to talk about \"her vision for the role and the campaign ahead.\"\n\n\"As I've said repeatedly over the past several weeks, the running mate decision was a deeply personal decision for the vice president - and it was also a deeply personal decision for me. Pennsylvanians elected me to a four-year term as their governor, and my work here is far from finished - there is a lot more stuff I want to get done for the good people of this commonwealth,\" Shapiro said in a statement.\n\nHe said he considers Walz a good friend and pledged to travel the state over the next three months to help Democrats defeat former President Donald Trump \"and build a better future for our country.\"\n\n\"Vice President Kamala Harris has my enthusiastic support - and I know that Governor Tim Walz is an exceptionally strong addition to the ticket who will help Kamala move our country forward,\" Shapiro said.\n\nAt the Governor's mansion, a Minnesota resident says why he likes Walz\n\nDavid Ivory, 46, stood outside the Governor's mansion with his two children. Ivory found out Walz was selected after his wife texted him \"OMG\" from work.\n\nHe and his kids immediately hopped on their bikes and rode to the Governor's residence in St. Paul.\n\nIvory and his family are longtime admirers of Walz for his liberal record and amiable political persona.\n\n\"He's just down to earth. He gets it. He can talk to anybody,\" Ivory said. \"He doesn't seem like he's above anybody. He was a teacher. He understands kids, which is very important.\"\n\nHarris says her new running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has 'delivered for working families'\n\n\"It's great to have him on the team,\" Harris said.\n\nHarris posted on X that she was proud to announce she asked Walz to join her on the 2024 ticket.\n\nVoter Coalition Pushes Issue-Based Outreach Strategy to Increase Registration, Shifting from Top of Ticket Politics\n\nState Voices launched a $3 million nationwide campaign Tuesday to encourage voters of color to vote based on the issues that affect their day-to-day lives, like grocery price spikes or growing rent and mortgage payments.\n\nUnder the Vote for Something campaign, the coalition aims to register 800,000 voters, make more than 250 million voter contacts, and encourage 100,000 people to make a plan to vote on or ahead of the 2024 election for themselves and others.\n\nThey've registered more than 400,000 voters so far.\n\nState Voices, like many voting rights advocates, hopes for messaging that transcends the top of the ticket -- a looming match between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\"Whatever the issue is that matters to you, vote for something. Get out this November and bring a friend and a family member with you,\" said Mishara Davis, the group's director of issue and electoral organizing.\n\nThe key has been reaching voters who may be tired of the political space altogether or who are eligible to vote but aren't registered and therefore may not receive voting information -- especially in presidential swing states, Georgia, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, which are primary areas under the campaign.\n\nThis comes as Harris, who is in Pennsylvania this week, has chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, sources say. The pair will continue the campaign tour to Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada starting Wednesday.\n\nEnvironmental group cheers selection of Walz as the Democratic vice presidential candidate\n\nManish Bapna, president and CEO of the NRDC Action Fund, the political arm of the Natural Resources Defense Council, called Harris and Walz \"the winning ticket on climate. The Harris-Walz administration will be ready, on day one, to build on the strongest climate action ever and lead by example in the global fight against the existential challenge of our time.''\n\nWalz has made Minnesota a national climate leader, Bapna said. Under his leadership, the state committed to 100% clean energy by 2040, and Minnesota was the first Midwestern state to adopt California's strict tailpipe emissions standards. Walz also signed a bill last year directing $240 million to replace lead service water lines statewide.\n\n\"The stakes in this election couldn't be higher nor the choice more clear. Trump would bow to billionaire oil and gas donors, slam climate progress into reverse and leave our kids to pay the price. Harris is a proven climate and justice leader with two decades of public service on the front lines of needed progress and change. She's shown us what leadership looks like, and she's earned the chance to lead,\" Bapna said.\n\nThe National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund praises Walz's selection\n\n\"The National LGBTQ Action Fund expected a strategic and bold choice as a strong addition to the ticket as a Vice-Presidential candidate,\" Sayre E. Reece, vice president of the National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, said Tuesday in a statement. \"In Governor Walz we have gotten both.\"\n\nReece continued: \"Governor Walz has been a steadfast ally and advocate for the LGBTQ community, including support for trans affirming care, bodily autonomy and reproductive freedom and gun control. As Governor, Walz signed a ban on so-called 'conversion therapy' into law, ending the harmful and cruel practice that has cost LGBTQ people their dignity and their lives. Under Walz's leadership, Minnesota is both a 'trans sanctuary' and immigration sanctuary state.\"\n\nThe National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund describes itself as lobbying for legislation and ballot initiatives that \"achieve justice\" for LGBTQ people.\n\nAt Walz's residence in Minnesota\n\nA growing crowd of residents and news reporters gathered outside Walz's residence in St. Paul, Minnesota, on Tuesday morning.\n\nBlack and white SUVs periodically pulled into the driveway as onlookers waited to catch a glimpse of Walz leaving the 20-room governor's mansion near the Mississippi River.\n\nNo immediate comment from Vance on Harris picking Walz as her running mate\n\nBoarding his campaign plane Tuesday morning in Cincinnati for a swing through battleground states this week, Ohio Sen. JD Vance did not answer shouted questions about Harris picking Walz as her running mate.\n\nOn Tuesday, Vance was heading to Pennsylvania, where Harris planned to debut with her new running mate later in the day.\n\nTrump attacks Walz in a fundraising email\n\nDonald Trump sent a fundraising email calling Walz \"Dangerously Liberal\" and saying he would \"unleash HELL ON EARTH.\"\n\nMoments after Harris' VP pick became public, the former president and Republican nominee said Walz would be the worst vice president in history, claiming the Minnesota governor would \"light TRILLIONS of dollars on fire\" and open U.S. borders to criminals.\n\n\"HE'S THAT BAD,\" the email says.\n\nThe selection process that led Harris to pick Walz as her running mate\n\nA team of lawyers and political operatives led by former attorney general Eric Holder pored over documents and conducted interviews with potential vice presidential selections.\n\nAnd Harris herself met with her three finalists on Sunday. She mulled the decision over Monday with top aides at the vice president's residence in Washington and finalized it Tuesday morning.\n\nWalz emerged as the choice.\n\nA Minnesota Democratic strategist praises Walz's ability to connect with voters\n\nMinnesota Democratic strategist Abu Amara says Walz will be a good surrogate for Harris across the upper Midwest, because he represented a rural U.S. House district but won statewide in a state with large metropolitan and suburban areas.\n\n\"He's not trying to speak in poetry. He speaks in practicality,\" Amara said. \"That's a level of accessibility for so many voters.\"\n\n\"He has the ability to connect with rural, suburban and urban voters,\" he said.\n\nSome Republicans are already reacting to the selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as Harris' VP pick\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis called it the \"most left-wing ticket in American history\" and accused Walz of not doing enough to protect Minnesota during the 2020 protests over the killing of George Floyd.\n\nHe said \"Walz sat by and let Minneapolis burn.\"\n\nTropical Storm Debby continues to upend Harris' travel plans this week\n\nThe campaign had already pulled down a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, because of the weather.\n\nBut the Democratic presidential nominee will now no longer travel to Raleigh, North Carolina, either, according to the campaign. She was set to travel to Raleigh on Thursday.\n\nHarris is launching a tour of battleground states on Tuesday evening, starting in Philadelphia.\n\nHarris picks Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as running mate, AP sources say\n\nVice President Kamala Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday. That's according to three people who spoke to The Associated Press.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she's turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families. The people were not authorized to speak publicly about the choice and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.\n\n-- Seung Min Kim, Zeke Miller and Colleen Long\n\nSources say Harris has decided on a running mate\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has decided on a running mate and an announcement is expected in the coming hours before the two appear together at a Philadelphia rally, according to three people familiar with her decision.\n\nIn recent days, she has zeroed in on a trio of potential finalists: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. It wasn't clear yet who she picked.\n\nThe people were familiar with her plans but spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that had not been publicly announced.\n\nHarris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\n-- Seung Min Kim, Zeke Miller and Colleen Long\n\nHarris formally secures the Democratic presidential nomination\n\nVice President Kamala Harris formally secured the Democratic presidential nomination late Monday -- becoming the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket.\n\nHarris' nomination became official after a five-day round of online balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates ended Monday night, with the party saying in a statement released just before midnight that 99% of delegates casting ballots had done so for Harris. It said it would next formally certify the vote before holding a celebratory roll call at the party's convention later this month in Chicago.\n\nHarris' coronation as her party's standard-bearer caps a tumultuous and frenetic period for Democrats prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous June debate performance.\n\nAs soon as Biden abruptly ended his candidacy, Harris and her team worked rapidly to secure backing from the 1,976 party delegates needed to clinch the nomination in a formal roll call vote. She reached that marker at warp speed, with an Associated Press survey of delegates nationwide showing she locked down the necessary commitments a mere 32 hours after Biden's announcement."],"source":{"uri":["idahostatejournal.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Idaho State Journal"]},"authors":[{"uri":["associated_press@idahostatejournal.com"],"name":["Associated Press"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[true]}],"image":["https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/idahostatejournal.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/13/613abbc1-f6ab-5c12-a83e-aa02168d3540/66b21cf763384.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize"],"eventUri":["eng-9795783"],"sentiment":[0.0824],"wgt":[460680935],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8262557578"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-06"],"time":["22:52:45"],"dateTime":["2024-08-06T22:52:45Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-06T22:52:04Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.8039],"url":["http://hosted.ap.org/article/f7b47f8fac1817e319e444d5caeb30b1/latest-harris-and-walz-debut-philadelphia-rally"],"title":["The Latest: Harris and Walz debut at Philadelphia rally"],"body":["Vice President Kamala Harris has chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, looking to strengthen the Democratic ticket in Midwestern states.\n\nShe introduced Walz at a rally Tuesday evening in Philadelphia.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a deadline last week. She officially claimed the nomination Monday night when the DNC released final results.\n\nHarris' selection of Walz as her running mate has been another fundraising boon for the Democratic presidential ticket.\n\nHer campaign announced shortly before 6:30 p.m. that it has raised more than $20 million since the vice president unveiled the Minnesota governor as her running mate.\n\nThe Harris campaign has seen a surge in fundraising since she took over the top of the ticket, raising more than $310 million in July. Well over $200 million of that total came after Harris took over top billing from President Joe Biden on July 21.\n\nAs Walz took the stage with Harris in Philadelphia, his status as Democrat's No. 2 for the general election was announced as official.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison and Minyon Moore, chair of Democrats' upcoming convention, said in a statement that Harris and Walz had been certified as their party's nominees.\n\nLate Monday night, Harris officially secured the delegates needed to become her party's presidential nominee. Hours later, she named Walz as her running mate.\n\nHarris ticked through Walz's record as Minnesota governor, saying he supports her goal of fighting for the middle class.\n\nWalz was the first governor in the country to sign a law enshrining abortion as a right, she said. She noted paid leave for women and voting rights.\n\nBut the biggest applause of the list came when Harris noted Walz's move to provide meals to all public school students.\n\n\"He refused to let students go hungry,\" she said. \"So, he made school breakfast and lunch free for every child.\"\n\nHarris also pointed out that her new running mate \"is a hunter and a gun owner too,\" then immediately noting that as governor Walz \"expanded background checks and increased penalties for illegal firearm sales.\"\n\n\"Under those Friday night lights Coach Walz motivated his players,\" Harris said referring to his time as high school football coach, \"Going from a winless record to the school's first-ever state championship.\"\n\nShe went on to note how as football coach he helped start the school's gay-straight alliance \"because he's the kind of person who makes them feel like they belong,\" she said.\n\n\"That's the kind of vice president he's going to be and that's the kind of vice president America deserves.\"\n\nHarris introduced Walz as \"more than a governor\" by running through the titles he's held over the years.\n\nBeyond that of husband and father, Harris said he was \"Sergeant Major Walz\" to his fellow veterans, \"Congressman\" to voters of southern Minnesota, \"Mr. Walz\" to the high school students he used to teach and \"Coach\" to the football players he coached.\n\n\"And in 91 days, the nation will know Coach Walz by another name: vice president of the United States,\" Harris said to cheers.\n\nHarris took the stage in Philadelphia for the first time as the Democratic presidential nominee Tuesday, amid raucous cheers in an auditorium on the campus of Temple University.\n\nBut her intro was serious.\n\n\"We need to move to the general election and win that,\" she said. \"We also need to level set. We are the underdogs in this race, but we have the momentum and I know exactly what we're up against.\"\n\nIn preparing to hand off to Walz, Harris is building him up as the partner she had been looking for during her quick search for a running mate.\n\n\"I set out to find a partner who can help build this brighter future, a leader that will help unite our nation and move us forward,\" she said.\n\n\"Pennsylvania, I'm here today because I found such a leader, Gov. Tim Walz of the great state of Minnesota.\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has made her first appearance with her newly chosen running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nHarris and Walz have taken the stage together at a packed rally in Philadelphia. The pair ignited sustained cheers as they appeared before thousands at Temple University's Liacouras Center.\n\nWalz, the 60-year-old governor and former U.S. House member from rural south central Minnesota, put his hands together and bowed to the crowd. He stood alongside Harris as she waved to the audience and put her hand over her heart, wrapping the other around Walz.\n\nAccording to excerpts provided by the campaign, Walz plans to use his speech to say that Minnesota values are American values.\n\n\"He heard it first from the vice president,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at her regular briefing. She said she couldn't \"pinpoint\" exactly where the president was when Harris called on Tuesday morning, but that he was somewhere in the executive mansion.\n\n\"She called him to let him know of her pick,\" Jean-Pierre said.\n\nHarris had sought Biden's advice during her search for a running mate, but Jean-Pierre left it there and declined to get into any specifics.\n\nBiden also spoke with Walz and congratulated him on his selection.\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker, who advocated fiercely but unsuccessfully for her state's governor, Josh Shapiro, to be Harris' running mate now says, \"Our Democratic nominee has spoken and that's it. Period. End of story.\"\n\nAt a rally in her city on Tuesday, Parker urged Pennsylvania Democrats to rally behind Harris' choice. Noting that Republicans and detractors would attempt to divide Democrats over the pick Parker says that the party can't let them.\n\nParker made headlines last week for posting a video praising Harris and Shapiro, which some thought suggested Harris had already picked Shapiro as her running mate. Instead, Harris chose Walz and the pair will appear together for the first time at the Philadelphia rally.\n\nDr. Scott Jensen, a physician and former Republican Minnesota state senator, was the last political candidate to run against Walz in a general election but lost by nearly 8 points. Jensen says Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance should be prepared for Walz's fast-talking debate style. He also thinks Walz's appeal in rural areas has been overstated.\n\n\"Tim Walz can talk around a topic extremely effectively. He will give people the impression that he is the candidate of the common, everyday person,\" Jensen said. \"But if you look at the results of the 2022 election, Tim Walz really won the election because of the Twin Cities, Duluth and Rochester.\"\n\nHe also pointed out that in the 2022 governor's race, Walz lost many of the counties in the district he previously represented in Congress.\n\n\"Tim Walz lost the district in which the people who knew him best were offered the opportunity to make a decision about his candidacy,\" Jensen said. \"I think that's telling.\"\n\nTrump says that he will do an interview with billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk next week. Musk endorsed the Republican for president after Trump survived an assassination attempt.\n\n\"ON MONDAY NIGHT I'LL BE DOING A MAJOR INTERVIEW WITH ELON MUSK -- Details to follow!\" Trump posted on his social media network.\n\nHis campaign did not immediately have more details to share.\n\nTrump, a longtime opponent of electric cars, said over the weekend at his rally in Atlanta that he favors electric cars \"for a small slice\" of the population, saying, \"I have to be, you know, because Elon endorsed me very strongly.\" He added: \"So I have no choice.\"\n\nAhead of a rally in Philadelphia, the Harris campaign has released experts of Walz's prepared remarks where he'll introduce himself to the nation, highlight his support for Harris and emphasize stopping Trump at the ballot.\n\nWalz will say that the vice president \"has fought on the side of the American people\" and \"brings joy to everything she does.\"\n\n\"Minnesota's strength comes from our values -- our commitment to working together, to seeing past our differences, to lending a helping hand,\" Walz plans to tell the rally. \"Donald Trump -- he sees the world differently. He doesn't know the first thing about service -- because he's too busy serving himself.\"\n\nWearing khakis and a camouflage baseball cap, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz accepted a phone call from Vice President Kamala Harris. The Harris campaign has posted a video of the call on social media.\n\n\"Hi, this is Tim,\" Walz said into his phone.\n\n\"It's Kamala Harris. Good morning, governor,\" the Democratic nominee said with a big smile. \"Listen, I want you to do this with me. Let's do this together. Would you be my running mate?\"\n\n\"I would be honored, madame vice president,\" Walz said.\n\nThe two exchanged pleasantries over the roughly minute-long video and Harris ended the call with an, \"All right, buddy. I'll see you soon. Take care.\"\n\nThe campaign said it has raised more than $10 million from \"grassroots supporters alone\" since Walz became her running mate.\n\nMarnie Fowler, a 44-year-old Philadelphia who works in concert touring, wore a blue T-shirt she recently purchased online that said: \"Childless Cat Lady,\" a reference to remarks by GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance. Farlow said she wanted Walz all along. \"He's America's dad,\" Farlow said. \"Everything he's done in Minnesota aligns with my values.\"\n\nCheryl Pitts, a 77-year-old retired state worker from Sicklerville, New Jersey, said she was \"a little bit\" disappointed that Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro wasn't picked, \"but it won't stop us from voting; it didn't diminish my excitement.\" She called Walz \"a regular kind of guy that I can believe what he says.\"\n\nBernie Strain, 66, wore a shirt he made himself for the rally that said: \"OLD WHITE MEN FOR HARRIS & FREEDOM.\" Strain said he'd met Shapiro through politics but was ready to support whoever Harris selected. \"I was open for whoever she picked,\" he said. \"I was going to support them with both feet.\"\n\nMark Campbell is a rare Republican who's publicly praising Harris' choice of Walz, calling it \"a home run.\"\n\nCampbell, a veteran GOP strategist who managed Glenn Youngkin's winning 2021 Virginia governor's campaign, ticked through a number of areas he suggests Walz reinforces Harris, first as an authentic surrogate in the northern battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nAn enlisted Army veteran, \"not officer class,\" Walz is \"plainspoken, folksy in a way that will play well in the burbs and rural areas,\" Cambell said.\n\nHe's \"progressive, but not too far from center,\" he said, and will align with \"Harris on policy 90% of the time.\" Campbell called the selection \"rock steady.\"\n\nBeshear said it was \"a true honor of a lifetime\" to be considered for Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate and that\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz was a good pick.\n\n\"He is a great friend,\" Beshear told reporters outside his office in the Kentucky Capitol on Tuesday afternoon. \"He'd be an amazing vice president. I am 100% onboard with doing everything I can to elect the Harris-Walz ticket this November.\"\n\nBeshear declined to comment on the process -- when he was interviewed for the job and if he heard from Harris or her team Tuesday morning.\n\nJeremy Green Eche, the trademark lawyer who purchased HarrisWalz.com for $8.99 in 2020, sold the domain - and a slate of others linked to Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris - on Tuesday for $15,000, he told The Associated Press shortly after the order was made.\n\nEche declined to say who bought the domains, but said they have \"no obvious connection to either campaign or anything political.\"\n\nHarris selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate Tuesday.\n\nEche bought the rights to the site and others in 2020 when the would-be vice president was in the midst of a primary campaign for president. When he learned Walz was the pick, Eche was particularly excited, both because the Harris supporter liked Walz best out of the men the vice president was considering, and because it meant someone paying his $15,000 asking price was more likely.\n\nNow that the site was sold, however, Eche says he feels glad but odd.\n\n\"I feel strange,\" he said, \"like it happened too soon.\"\n\nThe domains were sold on the website for Eche's start-up, Communer, a forum that allows people to buy and sell domains and trademarks online. Eche said the website will now draw up a domain transfer contract between himself and the buyer.\n\nA group founded in June by current and former Republican women who oppose Donald Trump for president came out in favor of Walz as Harris' pick, in part for Walz's fiscal measures and policy accomplishments aimed at women.\n\n\"As Governor, he's cut taxes for the middle class while balancing the budget, supported paid family leave so new mothers can be home to care for their children, expanded access to pre-kindergarten, and make sure that no Minnesotan child goes hungry at school,\" a release from Women4U.S. states.\n\nThe group is a federal superPAC whose honorary advisers include former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, former New Hampshire Republican Chair Jennifer Horn and founding editor of The Weekly Standard, Bill Kristol.\n\nSpeaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi welcomed the Minnesotan to what she called the Harris-Walz \"freedom ticket.\"\n\n\"In the Congress, I saw firsthand Tim Walz's leadership, collaborative spirit and effectiveness in bringing people together and getting the job done,\" Pelosi said in a statement.\n\nThe former Democratic House speaker was pivotal in reshaping the presidential race as President Joe Biden stepped aside and she said the field of potential VP candidates \"demonstrated the strength and vitality of the next generation of Democratic leadership.\"\n\nIt didn't take Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin long to seize on Harris' selection of Walz as a fundraising tool for her competitive reelection campaign.\n\n\"We're thrilled to see a fellow Midwesterner at the top of the ticket,\" Baldwin said in a fundraising email sent late Tuesday morning.\n\nBaldwin, seeking a third term, is among several incumbent Democratic senators seeking reelection in states viewed as pivotal to the presidential campaign, and where an uptick in enthusiasm since Harris' takeover of Joe Biden's campaign has lifted the party's hope of holding the seat.\n\nBaldwin spoke at Harris' first campaign stop as a candidate last month, an upbeat rally in suburban Milwaukee.\n\n\"Wisconsin has emerged as the tipping point state that will determine who wins the White House and which party controls the Senate,\" Baldwin's email said.\n\nBiden carried Wisconsin in 2020 by fewer than 21,000 votes.\n\nVoto Latino co-founder and President Maria Teresa Kumar said Walz's selection to the ticket would help energize Latino voters who want a more inclusive democracy.\n\nKumar said in a statement that Walz's \"strong record of defending democracy, protecting voting rights, and standing up for working families in Minnesota aligns perfectly with the values our organization and the Latino community hold dear.\"\n\nShe added that she knows the vice president and governor personally and knows they'll represent a powerful voice for \"progress, equality and opportunity for Latino communities and all Americans.\"\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly said he and his wife, former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, will do everything they can to elect Harris and Walz after Kelly was passed over for the Democratic ticket.\n\nKelly sent an email to supporters urging them to contribute to the Harris-Walz ticket.\n\n\"Tim has years of experience representing Minnesota both in the House of Representatives, where he served with Gabby, and as Minnesota's governor,\" Kelly wrote. \"In that time, he has shown up time and time again for working families and I know he'll continue that work in the White House.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the head of GIFFORDS, a gun-control advocacy group founded by Kelly and Giffords, called Walz \"a strong gun safety champion.\"\n\n\"Gun violence is a top concern for Americans this election cycle and we know the Harris-Walz ticket is the only one that will stand up to the gun lobby and save lives,\" said GIFFORDS Executive Director Emma Brown, who managed Kelly's 2022 Senate campaign and was his deputy campaign manager when in his first race two years earlier 2020.\n\nVance is aiming to tie what he portrays as Harris' failures along the U.S.-Mexico border to deaths from drug addiction.\n\nVance told several hundred supporters gathered in a South Philadelphia event space that, \"thanks to the policies of Kamala Harris, you've got children who've been orphaned\" when their parents die from drugs.\n\nSeveral Pennsylvanians shared personal stories of how addiction issues have impacted their families.\n\nAs he has over several speeches and interviews in recent weeks, Vance told his own story related to drug addition, noting that his mother has been drug-free for a decade but, as a child, he was \"desperately hoping and praying, Jesus, please let her wake up from this.\"\n\nU.S. government data undercuts the claim that people seeking asylum and other border crossers are responsible for drug trafficking. At a hearing last year, James Mandryck, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection deputy assistant commissioner, said 73% of fentanyl seizures at the border since the previous October were smuggling attempts carried out by U.S. citizens, with the rest being done by Mexican citizens.\n\n\"Governor Walz doesn't just have the experience to be vice president, he has the values and the integrity to make us proud,\" the former president and first lady said in a statement.\n\nThey said Walz enacted progressive priorities as Minnesota governor including paid family leave, abortion rights and gun safety measures.\n\n\"But Tim's signature is his ability to talk like a human being and treat everyone with decency and respect,\" the Obamas said.\n\nThe Republican told reporters aboard his campaign plane Tuesday that he called Walz earlier in the day but \"I left him a voicemail, I didn't get him.\"\n\nIt's not clear if there will be a debate between Vance and Walz. Last week, Trump said he wouldn't take part in an ABC News debate that had been on the books for September because he made that agreement with Biden before the president exited the campaign.\n\nInstead, Trump said he would debate Harris on Sept. 4 on Fox News, but the vice president hasn't agreed to that time or network yet.\n\nBiden called on Democrats and all Americans to rally behind them.\n\n\"They will be the strongest defenders of our personal freedoms and our democracy,\" Biden said in a social media post. \"And they will ensure that America continues to lead the world and play its role as the indispensable nation.\"\n\nBiden said choosing a running mate is a party nominee's first major decision and praised Harris' choice. He said he's known Walz for nearly two decades, praising his background as a teacher, football coach and National Guard soldier.\n\n\"Every generation of Americans faces a moment where they are asked to defend American democracy,\" Biden said. \"That moment is now.\"\n\nWhite House Senior Deputy Press Secretary Emilie Simons says Biden and Harris spoke on the phone Tuesday morning ahead of the official announcement that she selected Walz and that Biden spoke with Walz to congratulate him.\n\nIn his first public comments since his general election foe was set, JD Vance on Tuesday called Walz a choice that \"highlights how radical Kamala Harris is.\"\n\nIn a gaggle with reporters aboard his campaign plane upon landing in Philadelphia, Vance said Walz \"is a person who listens to the Hamas wing\" of the Democratic Party and \"who wants to make the American people more reliant on garbage energy instead of good American energy.\"\n\nVance is speaking more to reporters in Philadelphia on Tuesday ahead of campaign events across Midwestern battleground states on Wednesday, in a path that somewhat mirrors Harris and Walz's planned trajectory.\n\n\"Great choice,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\n\"Having served for years with Tim in the House of Representatives, I can say without reservation: there's no better person Vice President Harris could have picked to run and then govern alongside her,\" said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md.\n\nWalz \"has always put our country first,\" Van Hollen said, and he's excited to campaign for the Harris-Walz ticket for \"a brighter future for all Americans.\"\n\nRep. Mark Takano of California recalled how after Walz beat him during an internal House caucus vote to become the top Democrat on the Veterans Affairs Committee, his colleague \"immediately brought me into the fold because that's the type of leader he is: a collaborative bridge builder.\"\n\nAnd Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, who entered Congress with Walz in 2007, said he \"has always had this very straightforward, direct, open approach to things.\"\n\nWelch described Walz as \"one of these guys in the gym who wouldn't undo his tie\" because it would be faster for him to get back to work.\n\nTim Walz's biography as a military veteran and former high school teacher - two broadly trusted professions - may also help him appeal to Americans as he campaigns with Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAbout 9 in 10 U.S. adults say they have a favorable opinion of military veterans, generally, according to an Ipsos poll conducted in 2024. About 8 in 10 say that about school teachers. Both measures are much higher than for government employees or elected officials. Republicans are slightly more likely than Democrats to have a positive view of veterans, while Democrats are a bit more likely to have a favorable opinion of those in a teaching career.\n\nGallup polling from 2022 found that high school teachers are generally held in high regard among Americans for their honesty and ethical standards. About half, 53%, gave them at least a high rating on ethics.\n\nDemocratic nominee Kamala Harris is hoping her VP choice, Tim Walz, will strengthen the Democratic ticket in Midwestern states and among working class voters.\n\nAP VoteCast shows that when Walz was elected Minnesota governor in 2022, he won young voters in the state. He also did well in Minnesota's union households, winning nearly 6 in 10 voters in that group. About half of Minnesota voters, 52%, had a favorable view of Walz, and about 4 in 10 had a negative one.\n\nAnd while Walz lost white voters without a college education in the state, he outperformed Democrats nationwide with this group. He also struggled among white men, a demographic Democrats have sought to win back from President Donald Trump, but did a little better among this group than Democrats nationwide.\n\nHowever, Walz lost among military veteran households in Minnesota in 2022, according to VoteCast.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz will need to introduce himself to the vast majority of Americans.\n\nAn ABC News/Ipsos survey conducted before Walz was selected as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, but after vetting began, showed that nearly 9 in 10 U.S. adults did not know enough to have an opinion about him. Among Americans with a view, opinions were split between positive and negative: 6% had a favorable view, and 7% had an unfavorable one.\n\nWalz's lack of a national profile as he joins Harris on the campaign trail extends to his own party. Nearly 9 in 10 Democrats also didn't know enough to have an opinion of Walz in the ABC News/Ipsos poll. One in 10 had a favorable view of him, and just 4% had a negative opinion. He was an unknown figure among most Democrats across the party: those older and younger were similarly likely to not know Walz, as well as white Democrats and non-white Democrats.\n\nU.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar says Walz is someone who is \"just unendingly optimistic and joyous, and that is very, very important right now in our politics.\"\n\nThe fellow Minnesotan who served with Walz in Congress told The Associated Press \"he's blunt, but he's also positive\" in a way she believes will provide an upbeat message in contrast to the Trump-Vance Republican ticket.\n\n\"I always think of him in his plaid shirt because he was always making the point it's 'One Minnesota,'\" said Klobuchar, a Democrat. \"And I think that's a point you're going hear him talk about with our nation.\"\n\nShe said his background as a hunter and someone who fishes \"just brings a different perspective to the White House.\"\n\nThe SUVs left amid cheers from residents lined up on the sidewalk.\n\nJeremy Green Eche was in the middle of getting his toddler dressed the moment news broke that Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris had selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate.\n\nAnd he was amped.\n\nEche was uniquely invested in Harris' pick. He currently owns the rights to HarrisWalz.com, a site he bought in 2020 -- along with a slate of other Harris sites -- when the would-be vice president was in the midst of a primary campaign for president. Four years and one vice presidential pick later, Eche is willing to sell the slate of Harris websites, including the one featuring Walz, for $15,000.\n\n\"I was constantly refreshing four different news sites on my phone,\" he told The Associated Press on Tuesday. \"I was very excited.\" He said he \"almost immediately\" began getting calls from both journalists and \"friends I hadn't heard from in a while.\"\n\nThis is not a new scenario for the 36-year-old trademark lawyer in Brooklyn, New York. Eche is a cyber squatter, someone who buys a domain with someone else's name or brand in it for very little money, hoping to sell it to that person or brand for a large profit in the subsequent months or years. In 2011, when it looked likely that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would be the Democratic nominee in 2016, then Jeremy Peter Green - he took his wife's last name - purchased ClintonKaine.com.\n\nAfter the former secretary of state picked Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, the squatter offered it to the campaign for a hefty return. They declined, so he sold it for $15,000 to a digital marketing company that turned out to be the Trump campaign. The website pushed anti-Clinton news with \"Paid for by Donald J. Trump for President, Inc\" emblazoned at the bottom.\n\nEche supported Clinton in 2016 and supports Harris today. The prospect of something like that happening again doesn't give Eche pause, however.\n\n\"The Harris campaign has hundreds of millions of dollars, so if they don't buy their own domain, that is kind of on them,\" he said Monday. But he isn't convinced they will buy the domain.\n\n\"I don't want to be too confident that somebody will reach out,\" he said after Walz was selected. \"I would say there's a 75% chance that one of the campaigns, or a PAC, will buy it from me.\"\n\nIn a Tuesday morning post on X, Walz said joining the ticket with Harris is \"the honor of a lifetime.\"\n\nHis profile details on X are now \"Running to win this thing with @kamalaharris.\"\n\nShapiro called Walz \"an exceptionally strong addition to the ticket\" who'll help Harris become the 47th president.\n\nShapiro, who met with Harris on Sunday about the job, said he was grateful to talk about \"her vision for the role and the campaign ahead.\"\n\n\"As I've said repeatedly over the past several weeks, the running mate decision was a deeply personal decision for the vice president - and it was also a deeply personal decision for me. Pennsylvanians elected me to a four-year term as their governor, and my work here is far from finished - there is a lot more stuff I want to get done for the good people of this commonwealth,\" Shapiro said in a statement.\n\nHe said he considers Walz a good friend and pledged to travel the state over the next three months to help Democrats defeat former President Donald Trump \"and build a better future for our country.\"\n\n\"Vice President Kamala Harris has my enthusiastic support - and I know that Governor Tim Walz is an exceptionally strong addition to the ticket who will help Kamala move our country forward,\" Shapiro said.\n\nDavid Ivory, 46, stood outside the Governor's mansion with his two children. Ivory found out Walz was selected after his wife texted him \"OMG\" from work.\n\nHe and his kids immediately hopped on their bikes and rode to the Governor's residence in St. Paul.\n\nIvory and his family are longtime admirers of Walz for his liberal record and amiable political persona.\n\n\"He's just down to earth. He gets it. He can talk to anybody,\" Ivory said. \"He doesn't seem like he's above anybody. He was a teacher. He understands kids, which is very important.\"\n\n\"It's great to have him on the team,\" Harris said.\n\nHarris posted on X that she was proud to announce she asked Walz to join her on the 2024 ticket.\n\nState Voices launched a $3 million nationwide campaign Tuesday to encourage voters of color to vote based on the issues that affect their day-to-day lives, like grocery price spikes or growing rent and mortgage payments.\n\nUnder the Vote for Something campaign, the coalition aims to register 800,000 voters, make more than 250 million voter contacts, and encourage 100,000 people to make a plan to vote on or ahead of the 2024 election for themselves and others.\n\nThey've registered more than 400,000 voters so far.\n\nState Voices, like many voting rights advocates, hopes for messaging that transcends the top of the ticket -- a looming match between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\"Whatever the issue is that matters to you, vote for something. Get out this November and bring a friend and a family member with you,\" said Mishara Davis, the group's director of issue and electoral organizing.\n\nThe key has been reaching voters who may be tired of the political space altogether or who are eligible to vote but aren't registered and therefore may not receive voting information -- especially in presidential swing states, Georgia, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, which are primary areas under the campaign.\n\nThis comes as Harris, who is in Pennsylvania this week, has chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, sources say. The pair will continue the campaign tour to Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada starting Wednesday.\n\nManish Bapna, president and CEO of the NRDC Action Fund, the political arm of the Natural Resources Defense Council, called Harris and Walz \"the winning ticket on climate. The Harris-Walz administration will be ready, on day one, to build on the strongest climate action ever and lead by example in the global fight against the existential challenge of our time.''\n\nWalz has made Minnesota a national climate leader, Bapna said. Under his leadership, the state committed to 100% clean energy by 2040, and Minnesota was the first Midwestern state to adopt California's strict tailpipe emissions standards. Walz also signed a bill last year directing $240 million to replace lead service water lines statewide.\n\n\"The stakes in this election couldn't be higher nor the choice more clear. Trump would bow to billionaire oil and gas donors, slam climate progress into reverse and leave our kids to pay the price. Harris is a proven climate and justice leader with two decades of public service on the front lines of needed progress and change. She's shown us what leadership looks like, and she's earned the chance to lead,\" Bapna said.\n\n\"The National LGBTQ Action Fund expected a strategic and bold choice as a strong addition to the ticket as a Vice-Presidential candidate,\" Sayre E. Reece, vice president of the National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, said Tuesday in a statement. \"In Governor Walz we have gotten both.\"\n\nReece continued: \"Governor Walz has been a steadfast ally and advocate for the LGBTQ community, including support for trans affirming care, bodily autonomy and reproductive freedom and gun control. As Governor, Walz signed a ban on so-called 'conversion therapy' into law, ending the harmful and cruel practice that has cost LGBTQ people their dignity and their lives. Under Walz's leadership, Minnesota is both a 'trans sanctuary' and immigration sanctuary state.\"\n\nThe National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund describes itself as lobbying for legislation and ballot initiatives that \"achieve justice\" for LGBTQ people.\n\nA growing crowd of residents and news reporters gathered outside Walz's residence in St. Paul, Minnesota, on Tuesday morning.\n\nBlack and white SUVs periodically pulled into the driveway as onlookers waited to catch a glimpse of Walz leaving the 20-room governor's mansion near the Mississippi River.\n\nBoarding his campaign plane Tuesday morning in Cincinnati for a swing through battleground states this week, Ohio Sen. JD Vance did not answer shouted questions about Harris picking Walz as her running mate.\n\nOn Tuesday, Vance was heading to Pennsylvania, where Harris planned to debut with her new running mate later in the day.\n\nDonald Trump sent a fundraising email calling Walz \"Dangerously Liberal\" and saying he would \"unleash HELL ON EARTH.\"\n\nMoments after Harris' VP pick became public, the former president and Republican nominee said Walz would be the worst vice president in history, claiming the Minnesota governor would \"light TRILLIONS of dollars on fire\" and open U.S. borders to criminals.\n\n\"HE'S THAT BAD,\" the email says.\n\nA team of lawyers and political operatives led by former attorney general Eric Holder pored over documents and conducted interviews with potential vice presidential selections.\n\nAnd Harris herself met with her three finalists on Sunday. She mulled the decision over Monday with top aides at the vice president's residence in Washington and finalized it Tuesday morning.\n\nWalz emerged as the choice.\n\nMinnesota Democratic strategist Abu Amara says Walz will be a good surrogate for Harris across the upper Midwest, because he represented a rural U.S. House district but won statewide in a state with large metropolitan and suburban areas.\n\n\"He's not trying to speak in poetry. He speaks in practicality,\" Amara said. \"That's a level of accessibility for so many voters.\"\n\n\"He has the ability to connect with rural, suburban and urban voters,\" he said.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis called it the \"most left-wing ticket in American history\" and accused Walz of not doing enough to protect Minnesota during the 2020 protests over the killing of George Floyd.\n\nHe said \"Walz sat by and let Minneapolis burn.\"\n\nThe campaign had already pulled down a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, because of the weather.\n\nBut the Democratic presidential nominee will now no longer travel to Raleigh, North Carolina, either, according to the campaign. She was set to travel to Raleigh on Thursday.\n\nHarris is launching a tour of battleground states on Tuesday evening, starting in Philadelphia.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday. That's according to three people who spoke to The Associated Press.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she's turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families. The people were not authorized to speak publicly about the choice and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.\n\n-- Seung Min Kim, Zeke Miller and Colleen Long\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has decided on a running mate and an announcement is expected in the coming hours before the two appear together at a Philadelphia rally, according to three people familiar with her decision.\n\nIn recent days, she has zeroed in on a trio of potential finalists: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. It wasn't clear yet who she picked.\n\nThe people were familiar with her plans but spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that had not been publicly announced.\n\nHarris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\n-- Seung Min Kim, Zeke Miller and Colleen Long\n\nVice President Kamala Harris formally secured the Democratic presidential nomination late Monday -- becoming the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket.\n\nHarris' nomination became official after a five-day round of online balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates ended Monday night, with the party saying in a statement released just before midnight that 99% of delegates casting ballots had done so for Harris. It said it would next formally certify the vote before holding a celebratory roll call at the party's convention later this month in Chicago.\n\nHarris' coronation as her party's standard-bearer caps a tumultuous and frenetic period for Democrats prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous June debate performance.\n\nAs soon as Biden abruptly ended his candidacy, Harris and her team worked rapidly to secure backing from the 1,976 party delegates needed to clinch the nomination in a formal roll call vote. She reached that marker at warp speed, with an Associated Press survey of delegates nationwide showing she locked down the necessary commitments a mere 32 hours after Biden's announcement."],"source":{"uri":["hosted.ap.org"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Associated Press"]},"authors":[],"image":["summary_large_image"],"eventUri":["eng-9795783"],"sentiment":[0.0353],"wgt":[460680765],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8262556122"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-06"],"time":["22:51:10"],"dateTime":["2024-08-06T22:51:10Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-06T22:50:04Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.651],"url":["https://lacrossetribune.com/news/state-and-regional/mn/the-latest-harris-and-walz-debut-at-philadelphia-rally/article_6154f901-c3a6-5c1e-9efe-47325a26ee03.html"],"title":["The Latest: Harris and Walz debut at Philadelphia rally"],"body":["FILE - Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump arrives to speak at a campaign rally, July 31, 2024, in Harrisburg, Pa.

They say he should focus solely on the economy and immigration.\n\nBy The Associated Press\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, looking to strengthen the Democratic ticket in Midwestern states.\n\nShe introduced Walz at a rally Tuesday evening in Philadelphia.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a deadline last week.

Tim Walz.\n\nHarris and Walz have taken the stage together at a packed rally in Philadelphia. The pair ignited sustained cheers as they appeared before thousands at Temple University's Liacouras Center.\n\nWalz, the 60-year-old governor and former U.S. House member from rural south central Minnesota, put his hands together and bowed to the crowd. He stood alongside Harris as she waved to the audience and put her hand over her heart, wrapping the other around Walz.\n\nAccording to excerpts provided by the campaign, Walz plans to use his speech to say that Minnesota values are American values.\n\nBiden learned about Walz from Harris, not the news\n\n\"He heard it first from the vice president,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at her regular briefing. She said she couldn't \"pinpoint\" exactly where the president was when Harris called on Tuesday morning, but that he was somewhere in the executive mansion.\n\n\"She called him to let him know of her pick,\" Jean-Pierre said.\n\nHarris had sought Biden's advice during her search for a running mate, but Jean-Pierre left it there and declined to get into any specifics.\n\nBiden also spoke with Walz and congratulated him on his selection.\n\nPhiladelphia mayor calls for unity among Democrats\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker, who advocated fiercely but unsuccessfully for her state's governor, Josh Shapiro, to be Harris' running mate now says, \"Our Democratic nominee has spoken and that's it. Period. End of story.\"\n\nAt a rally in her city on Tuesday, Parker urged Pennsylvania Democrats to rally behind Harris' choice. Noting that Republicans and detractors would attempt to divide Democrats over the pick Parker says that the party can't let them.\n\nParker made headlines last week for posting a video praising Harris and Shapiro, which some thought suggested Harris had already picked Shapiro as her running mate. Instead, Harris chose Walz and the pair will appear together for the first time at the Philadelphia rally.\n\nThe last politician to face off against Tim Walz has some advice for JD Vance\n\nDr. Scott Jensen, a physician and former Republican Minnesota state senator, was the last political candidate to run against Walz in a general election but lost by nearly 8 points. Jensen says Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance should be prepared for Walz's fast-talking debate style. He also thinks Walz's appeal in rural areas has been overstated.\n\n\"Tim Walz can talk around a topic extremely effectively. He will give people the impression that he is the candidate of the common, everyday person,\" Jensen said. \"But if you look at the results of the 2022 election, Tim Walz really won the election because of the Twin Cities, Duluth and Rochester.\"\n\nHe also pointed out that in the 2022 governor's race, Walz lost many of the counties in the district he previously represented in Congress.\n\n\"Tim Walz lost the district in which the people who knew him best were offered the opportunity to make a decision about his candidacy,\" Jensen said. \"I think that's telling.\"\n\nTrump will sit for an interview with Elon Musk\n\nTrump says that he will do an interview with billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk next week. Musk endorsed the Republican for president after Trump survived an assassination attempt.\n\n\"ON MONDAY NIGHT I'LL BE DOING A MAJOR INTERVIEW WITH ELON MUSK -- Details to follow!\" Trump posted on his social media network.\n\nHis campaign did not immediately have more details to share.\n\nTrump, a longtime opponent of electric cars, said over the weekend at his rally in Atlanta that he favors electric cars \"for a small slice\" of the population, saying, \"I have to be, you know, because Elon endorsed me very strongly.\" He added: \"So I have no choice.\"\n\nExpect Walz to extol Harris during his first running mate appearance\n\nAhead of a rally in Philadelphia, the Harris campaign has released experts of Walz's prepared remarks where he'll introduce himself to the nation, highlight his support for Harris and emphasize stopping Trump at the ballot.\n\nWalz will say that the vice president \"has fought on the side of the American people\" and \"brings joy to everything she does.\"\n\n\"Minnesota's strength comes from our values -- our commitment to working together, to seeing past our differences, to lending a helping hand,\" Walz plans to tell the rally. \"Donald Trump -- he sees the world differently. He doesn't know the first thing about service -- because he's too busy serving himself.\"\n\nThe phone call that sealed the deal\n\nWearing khakis and a camouflage baseball cap, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz accepted a phone call from Vice President Kamala Harris. The Harris campaign has posted a video of the call on social media.\n\n\"Hi, this is Tim,\" Walz said into his phone.\n\n\"It's Kamala Harris. Good morning, governor,\" the Democratic nominee said with a big smile. \"Listen, I want you to do this with me. Let's do this together. Would you be my running mate?\"\n\n\"I would be honored, madame vice president,\" Walz said.\n\nThe two exchanged pleasantries over the roughly minute-long video and Harris ended the call with an, \"All right, buddy. I'll see you soon. Take care.\"\n\nThe campaign said it has raised more than $10 million from \"grassroots supporters alone\" since Walz became her running mate.\n\nVoter Voices: 'I was open for whoever she picked'\n\nMarnie Fowler, a 44-year-old Philadelphia who works in concert touring, wore a blue T-shirt she recently purchased online that said: \"Childless Cat Lady,\" a reference to remarks by GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance. Farlow said she wanted Walz all along. \"He's America's dad,\" Farlow said. \"Everything he's done in Minnesota aligns with my values.\"\n\nCheryl Pitts, a 77-year-old retired state worker from Sicklerville, New Jersey, said she was \"a little bit\" disappointed that Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro wasn't picked, \"but it won't stop us from voting; it didn't diminish my excitement.\" She called Walz \"a regular kind of guy that I can believe what he says.\"\n\nBernie Strain, 66, wore a shirt he made himself for the rally that said: \"OLD WHITE MEN FOR HARRIS & FREEDOM.\" Strain said he'd met Shapiro through politics but was ready to support whoever Harris selected. \"I was open for whoever she picked,\" he said. \"I was going to support them with both feet.\"\n\nA Republican strategist actually praising Harris' VP pick\n\nMark Campbell is a rare Republican who's publicly praising Harris' choice of Walz, calling it \"a home run.\"\n\nCampbell, a veteran GOP strategist who managed Glenn Youngkin's winning 2021 Virginia governor's campaign, ticked through a number of areas he suggests Walz reinforces Harris, first as an authentic surrogate in the northern battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nAn enlisted Army veteran, \"not officer class,\" Walz is \"plainspoken, folksy in a way that will play well in the burbs and rural areas,\" Cambell said.\n\nHe's \"progressive, but not too far from center,\" he said, and will align with \"Harris on policy 90% of the time.\" Campbell called the selection \"rock steady.\"\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says Walz is a good pick for Harris' running mate\n\nBeshear said it was \"a true honor of a lifetime\" to be considered for Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate and that\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz was a good pick.\n\n\"He is a great friend,\" Beshear told reporters outside his office in the Kentucky Capitol on Tuesday afternoon. \"He'd be an amazing vice president. I am 100% onboard with doing everything I can to elect the Harris-Walz ticket this November.\"\n\nBeshear declined to comment on the process -- when he was interviewed for the job and if he heard from Harris or her team Tuesday morning.\n\nMan who owned rights to HarrisWalz.com says he's sold the domain; declined to name the buyer\n\nJeremy Green Eche, the trademark lawyer who purchased HarrisWalz.com for $8.99 in 2020, sold the domain - and a slate of others linked to Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris - on Tuesday for $15,000, he told The Associated Press shortly after the order was made.\n\nEche declined to say who bought the domains, but said they have \"no obvious connection to either campaign or anything political.\"\n\nHarris selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate Tuesday.\n\nEche bought the rights to the site and others in 2020 when the would-be vice president was in the midst of a primary campaign for president. When he learned Walz was the pick, Eche was particularly excited, both because the Harris supporter liked Walz best out of the men the vice president was considering, and because it meant someone paying his $15,000 asking price was more likely.\n\nNow that the site was sold, however, Eche says he feels glad but odd.\n\n\"I feel strange,\" he said, \"like it happened too soon.\"\n\nThe domains were sold on the website for Eche's start-up, Communer, a forum that allows people to buy and sell domains and trademarks online. Eche said the website will now draw up a domain transfer contract between himself and the buyer.\n\nGroup founded by Republican women opposed to Trump support Walz\n\nA group founded in June by current and former Republican women who oppose Donald Trump for president came out in favor of Walz as Harris' pick, in part for Walz's fiscal measures and policy accomplishments aimed at women.\n\n\"As Governor, he's cut taxes for the middle class while balancing the budget, supported paid family leave so new mothers can be home to care for their children, expanded access to pre-kindergarten, and make sure that no Minnesotan child goes hungry at school,\" a release from Women4U.S. states.\n\nThe group is a federal superPAC whose honorary advisers include former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, former New Hampshire Republican Chair Jennifer Horn and founding editor of The Weekly Standard, Bill Kristol.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi welcomes Walz to the race\n\nSpeaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi welcomed the Minnesotan to what she called the Harris-Walz \"freedom ticket.\"\n\n\"In the Congress, I saw firsthand Tim Walz's leadership, collaborative spirit and effectiveness in bringing people together and getting the job done,\" Pelosi said in a statement.\n\nThe former Democratic House speaker was pivotal in reshaping the presidential race as President Joe Biden stepped aside and she said the field of potential VP candidates \"demonstrated the strength and vitality of the next generation of Democratic leadership.\"\n\nWisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin: 'We're thrilled to see a fellow Midwesterner at the top of the ticket'\n\nIt didn't take Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin long to seize on Harris' selection of Walz as a fundraising tool for her competitive reelection campaign.\n\n\"We're thrilled to see a fellow Midwesterner at the top of the ticket,\" Baldwin said in a fundraising email sent late Tuesday morning.\n\nBaldwin, seeking a third term, is among several incumbent Democratic senators seeking reelection in states viewed as pivotal to the presidential campaign, and where an uptick in enthusiasm since Harris' takeover of Joe Biden's campaign has lifted the party's hope of holding the seat.\n\nBaldwin spoke at Harris' first campaign stop as a candidate last month, an upbeat rally in suburban Milwaukee.\n\n\"Wisconsin has emerged as the tipping point state that will determine who wins the White House and which party controls the Senate,\" Baldwin's email said.\n\nBiden carried Wisconsin in 2020 by fewer than 21,000 votes.\n\nVoto Latino co-founder says Walz as running mate will help energize Latino voters\n\nVoto Latino co-founder and President Maria Teresa Kumar said Walz's selection to the ticket would help energize Latino voters who want a more inclusive democracy.\n\nKumar said in a statement that Walz's \"strong record of defending democracy, protecting voting rights, and standing up for working families in Minnesota aligns perfectly with the values our organization and the Latino community hold dear.\"\n\nShe added that she knows the vice president and governor personally and knows they'll represent a powerful voice for \"progress, equality and opportunity for Latino communities and all Americans.\"\n\nSen. Mark Kelly urges supporters to contribute to the Harris-Walz ticket\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly said he and his wife, former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, will do everything they can to elect Harris and Walz after Kelly was passed over for the Democratic ticket.\n\nKelly sent an email to supporters urging them to contribute to the Harris-Walz ticket.\n\n\"Tim has years of experience representing Minnesota both in the House of Representatives, where he served with Gabby, and as Minnesota's governor,\" Kelly wrote. \"In that time, he has shown up time and time again for working families and I know he'll continue that work in the White House.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the head of GIFFORDS, a gun-control advocacy group founded by Kelly and Giffords, called Walz \"a strong gun safety champion.\"\n\n\"Gun violence is a top concern for Americans this election cycle and we know the Harris-Walz ticket is the only one that will stand up to the gun lobby and save lives,\" said GIFFORDS Executive Director Emma Brown, who managed Kelly's 2022 Senate campaign and was his deputy campaign manager when in his first race two years earlier 2020.\n\nVance blames Harris' policies for drug addiction deaths\n\nVance is aiming to tie what he portrays as Harris' failures along the U.S.-Mexico border to deaths from drug addiction.\n\nVance told several hundred supporters gathered in a South Philadelphia event space that, \"thanks to the policies of Kamala Harris, you've got children who've been orphaned\" when their parents die from drugs.\n\nSeveral Pennsylvanians shared personal stories of how addiction issues have impacted their families.\n\nAs he has over several speeches and interviews in recent weeks, Vance told his own story related to drug addition, noting that his mother has been drug-free for a decade but, as a child, he was \"desperately hoping and praying, Jesus, please let her wake up from this.\"\n\nU.S. government data undercuts the claim that people seeking asylum and other border crossers are responsible for drug trafficking. At a hearing last year, James Mandryck, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection deputy assistant commissioner, said 73% of fentanyl seizures at the border since the previous October were smuggling attempts carried out by U.S. citizens, with the rest being done by Mexican citizens.\n\nBarack and Michelle Obama say Harris 'has chosen an ideal partner'\n\n\"Governor Walz doesn't just have the experience to be vice president, he has the values and the integrity to make us proud,\" the former president and first lady said in a statement.\n\nThey said Walz enacted progressive priorities as Minnesota governor including paid family leave, abortion rights and gun safety measures.\n\n\"But Tim's signature is his ability to talk like a human being and treat everyone with decency and respect,\" the Obamas said.\n\nVance says he tried to get Walz on the phone\n\nThe Republican told reporters aboard his campaign plane Tuesday that he called Walz earlier in the day but \"I left him a voicemail, I didn't get him.\"\n\nIt's not clear if there will be a debate between Vance and Walz. Last week, Trump said he wouldn't take part in an ABC News debate that had been on the books for September because he made that agreement with Biden before the president exited the campaign.\n\nInstead, Trump said he would debate Harris on Sept. 4 on Fox News, but the vice president hasn't agreed to that time or network yet.\n\nPresident Joe Biden calls Harris-Walz ticket 'a powerful voice for working people' and middle class\n\nBiden called on Democrats and all Americans to rally behind them.\n\n\"They will be the strongest defenders of our personal freedoms and our democracy,\" Biden said in a social media post. \"And they will ensure that America continues to lead the world and play its role as the indispensable nation.\"\n\nBiden said choosing a running mate is a party nominee's first major decision and praised Harris' choice. He said he's known Walz for nearly two decades, praising his background as a teacher, football coach and National Guard soldier.\n\n\"Every generation of Americans faces a moment where they are asked to defend American democracy,\" Biden said. \"That moment is now.\"\n\nWhite House Senior Deputy Press Secretary Emilie Simons says Biden and Harris spoke on the phone Tuesday morning ahead of the official announcement that she selected Walz and that Biden spoke with Walz to congratulate him.\n\nVance says Walz pick as running mate 'highlights how radical' Harris is\n\nIn his first public comments since his general election foe was set, JD Vance on Tuesday called Walz a choice that \"highlights how radical Kamala Harris is.\"\n\nIn a gaggle with reporters aboard his campaign plane upon landing in Philadelphia, Vance said Walz \"is a person who listens to the Hamas wing\" of the Democratic Party and \"who wants to make the American people more reliant on garbage energy instead of good American energy.\"\n\nVance is speaking more to reporters in Philadelphia on Tuesday ahead of campaign events across Midwestern battleground states on Wednesday, in a path that somewhat mirrors Harris and Walz's planned trajectory.\n\nFormer colleagues on Capitol Hill appear thrilled with Walz as the VP pick\n\n\"Great choice,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\n\"Having served for years with Tim in the House of Representatives, I can say without reservation: there's no better person Vice President Harris could have picked to run and then govern alongside her,\" said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md.\n\nWalz \"has always put our country first,\" Van Hollen said, and he's excited to campaign for the Harris-Walz ticket for \"a brighter future for all Americans.\"\n\nRep. Mark Takano of California recalled how after Walz beat him during an internal House caucus vote to become the top Democrat on the Veterans Affairs Committee, his colleague \"immediately brought me into the fold because that's the type of leader he is: a collaborative bridge builder.\"\n\nAnd Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, who entered Congress with Walz in 2007, said he \"has always had this very straightforward, direct, open approach to things.\"\n\nWelch described Walz as \"one of these guys in the gym who wouldn't undo his tie\" because it would be faster for him to get back to work.\n\nPolling shows the appeal of Tim Walz's biography\n\nTim Walz's biography as a military veteran and former high school teacher - two broadly trusted professions - may also help him appeal to Americans as he campaigns with Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAbout 9 in 10 U.S. adults say they have a favorable opinion of military veterans, generally, according to an Ipsos poll conducted in 2024. About 8 in 10 say that about school teachers. Both measures are much higher than for government employees or elected officials. Republicans are slightly more likely than Democrats to have a positive view of veterans, while Democrats are a bit more likely to have a favorable opinion of those in a teaching career.\n\nGallup polling from 2022 found that high school teachers are generally held in high regard among Americans for their honesty and ethical standards. About half, 53%, gave them at least a high rating on ethics.\n\nAP VoteCast shows Tim Walz's electoral strengths and weakness in Minnesota\n\nDemocratic nominee Kamala Harris is hoping her VP choice, Tim Walz, will strengthen the Democratic ticket in Midwestern states and among working class voters.\n\nAP VoteCast shows that when Walz was elected Minnesota governor in 2022, he won young voters in the state. He also did well in Minnesota's union households, winning nearly 6 in 10 voters in that group. About half of Minnesota voters, 52%, had a favorable view of Walz, and about 4 in 10 had a negative one.\n\nAnd while Walz lost white voters without a college education in the state, he outperformed Democrats nationwide with this group. He also struggled among white men, a demographic Democrats have sought to win back from President Donald Trump, but did a little better among this group than Democrats nationwide.\n\nHowever, Walz lost among military veteran households in Minnesota in 2022, according to VoteCast.\n\nTim Walz will need to introduce himself to America\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz will need to introduce himself to the vast majority of Americans.\n\nAn ABC News/Ipsos survey conducted before Walz was selected as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, but after vetting began, showed that nearly 9 in 10 U.S. adults did not know enough to have an opinion about him. Among Americans with a view, opinions were split between positive and negative: 6% had a favorable view, and 7% had an unfavorable one.\n\nWalz's lack of a national profile as he joins Harris on the campaign trail extends to his own party. Nearly 9 in 10 Democrats also didn't know enough to have an opinion of Walz in the ABC News/Ipsos poll. One in 10 had a favorable view of him, and just 4% had a negative opinion. He was an unknown figure among most Democrats across the party: those older and younger were similarly likely to not know Walz, as well as white Democrats and non-white Democrats.\n\nFellow Minnesotan Sen. Amy Klobuchar says Walz is 'just unendingly optimistic and joyous'\n\nU.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar says Walz is someone who is \"just unendingly optimistic and joyous, and that is very, very important right now in our politics.\"\n\nThe fellow Minnesotan who served with Walz in Congress told The Associated Press \"he's blunt, but he's also positive\" in a way she believes will provide an upbeat message in contrast to the Trump-Vance Republican ticket.\n\n\"I always think of him in his plaid shirt because he was always making the point it's 'One Minnesota,'\" said Klobuchar, a Democrat. \"And I think that's a point you're going hear him talk about with our nation.\"\n\nShe said his background as a hunter and someone who fishes \"just brings a different perspective to the White House.\"\n\nSeveral black and white SUVs have left the Governor's residence in St. Paul\n\nThe SUVs left amid cheers from residents lined up on the sidewalk.\n\nHarris' running mate pick is good news for man who owns rights to HarrisWalz.com\n\nJeremy Green Eche was in the middle of getting his toddler dressed the moment news broke that Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris had selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate.\n\nAnd he was amped.\n\nEche was uniquely invested in Harris' pick. He currently owns the rights to HarrisWalz.com, a site he bought in 2020 -- along with a slate of other Harris sites -- when the would-be vice president was in the midst of a primary campaign for president. Four years and one vice presidential pick later, Eche is willing to sell the slate of Harris websites, including the one featuring Walz, for $15,000.\n\n\"I was constantly refreshing four different news sites on my phone,\" he told The Associated Press on Tuesday. \"I was very excited.\" He said he \"almost immediately\" began getting calls from both journalists and \"friends I hadn't heard from in a while.\"\n\nThis is not a new scenario for the 36-year-old trademark lawyer in Brooklyn, New York. Eche is a cyber squatter, someone who buys a domain with someone else's name or brand in it for very little money, hoping to sell it to that person or brand for a large profit in the subsequent months or years. In 2011, when it looked likely that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would be the Democratic nominee in 2016, then Jeremy Peter Green - he took his wife's last name - purchased ClintonKaine.com.\n\nAfter the former secretary of state picked Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, the squatter offered it to the campaign for a hefty return. They declined, so he sold it for $15,000 to a digital marketing company that turned out to be the Trump campaign. The website pushed anti-Clinton news with \"Paid for by Donald J. Trump for President, Inc\" emblazoned at the bottom.\n\nEche supported Clinton in 2016 and supports Harris today. The prospect of something like that happening again doesn't give Eche pause, however.\n\n\"The Harris campaign has hundreds of millions of dollars, so if they don't buy their own domain, that is kind of on them,\" he said Monday. But he isn't convinced they will buy the domain.\n\n\"I don't want to be too confident that somebody will reach out,\" he said after Walz was selected. \"I would say there's a 75% chance that one of the campaigns, or a PAC, will buy it from me.\"\n\nWalz says he's 'all in'\n\nIn a Tuesday morning post on X, Walz said joining the ticket with Harris is \"the honor of a lifetime.\"\n\nHis profile details on X are now \"Running to win this thing with @kamalaharris.\"\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro on Walz\n\nShapiro called Walz \"an exceptionally strong addition to the ticket\" who'll help Harris become the 47th president.\n\nShapiro, who met with Harris on Sunday about the job, said he was grateful to talk about \"her vision for the role and the campaign ahead.\"\n\n\"As I've said repeatedly over the past several weeks, the running mate decision was a deeply personal decision for the vice president - and it was also a deeply personal decision for me. Pennsylvanians elected me to a four-year term as their governor, and my work here is far from finished - there is a lot more stuff I want to get done for the good people of this commonwealth,\" Shapiro said in a statement.\n\nHe said he considers Walz a good friend and pledged to travel the state over the next three months to help Democrats defeat former President Donald Trump \"and build a better future for our country.\"\n\n\"Vice President Kamala Harris has my enthusiastic support - and I know that Governor Tim Walz is an exceptionally strong addition to the ticket who will help Kamala move our country forward,\" Shapiro said.\n\nAt the Governor's mansion, a Minnesota resident says why he likes Walz\n\nDavid Ivory, 46, stood outside the Governor's mansion with his two children. Ivory found out Walz was selected after his wife texted him \"OMG\" from work.\n\nHe and his kids immediately hopped on their bikes and rode to the Governor's residence in St. Paul.\n\nIvory and his family are longtime admirers of Walz for his liberal record and amiable political persona.\n\n\"He's just down to earth. He gets it. He can talk to anybody,\" Ivory said. \"He doesn't seem like he's above anybody. He was a teacher. He understands kids, which is very important.\"\n\nHarris says her new running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has 'delivered for working families'\n\n\"It's great to have him on the team,\" Harris said.\n\nHarris posted on X that she was proud to announce she asked Walz to join her on the 2024 ticket.\n\nVoter Coalition Pushes Issue-Based Outreach Strategy to Increase Registration, Shifting from Top of Ticket Politics\n\nState Voices launched a $3 million nationwide campaign Tuesday to encourage voters of color to vote based on the issues that affect their day-to-day lives, like grocery price spikes or growing rent and mortgage payments.\n\nUnder the Vote for Something campaign, the coalition aims to register 800,000 voters, make more than 250 million voter contacts, and encourage 100,000 people to make a plan to vote on or ahead of the 2024 election for themselves and others.\n\nThey've registered more than 400,000 voters so far.\n\nState Voices, like many voting rights advocates, hopes for messaging that transcends the top of the ticket -- a looming match between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\"Whatever the issue is that matters to you, vote for something. Get out this November and bring a friend and a family member with you,\" said Mishara Davis, the group's director of issue and electoral organizing.\n\nThe key has been reaching voters who may be tired of the political space altogether or who are eligible to vote but aren't registered and therefore may not receive voting information -- especially in presidential swing states, Georgia, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, which are primary areas under the campaign.\n\nThis comes as Harris, who is in Pennsylvania this week, has chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, sources say. The pair will continue the campaign tour to Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada starting Wednesday.\n\nEnvironmental group cheers selection of Walz as the Democratic vice presidential candidate\n\nManish Bapna, president and CEO of the NRDC Action Fund, the political arm of the Natural Resources Defense Council, called Harris and Walz \"the winning ticket on climate. The Harris-Walz administration will be ready, on day one, to build on the strongest climate action ever and lead by example in the global fight against the existential challenge of our time.''\n\nWalz has made Minnesota a national climate leader, Bapna said. Under his leadership, the state committed to 100% clean energy by 2040, and Minnesota was the first Midwestern state to adopt California's strict tailpipe emissions standards. Walz also signed a bill last year directing $240 million to replace lead service water lines statewide.\n\n\"The stakes in this election couldn't be higher nor the choice more clear. Trump would bow to billionaire oil and gas donors, slam climate progress into reverse and leave our kids to pay the price. Harris is a proven climate and justice leader with two decades of public service on the front lines of needed progress and change. She's shown us what leadership looks like, and she's earned the chance to lead,\" Bapna said.\n\nThe National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund praises Walz's selection\n\n\"The National LGBTQ Action Fund expected a strategic and bold choice as a strong addition to the ticket as a Vice-Presidential candidate,\" Sayre E. Reece, vice president of the National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, said Tuesday in a statement. \"In Governor Walz we have gotten both.\"\n\nReece continued: \"Governor Walz has been a steadfast ally and advocate for the LGBTQ community, including support for trans affirming care, bodily autonomy and reproductive freedom and gun control. As Governor, Walz signed a ban on so-called 'conversion therapy' into law, ending the harmful and cruel practice that has cost LGBTQ people their dignity and their lives. Under Walz's leadership, Minnesota is both a 'trans sanctuary' and immigration sanctuary state.\"\n\nThe National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund describes itself as lobbying for legislation and ballot initiatives that \"achieve justice\" for LGBTQ people.\n\nAt Walz's residence in Minnesota\n\nA growing crowd of residents and news reporters gathered outside Walz's residence in St. Paul, Minnesota, on Tuesday morning.\n\nBlack and white SUVs periodically pulled into the driveway as onlookers waited to catch a glimpse of Walz leaving the 20-room governor's mansion near the Mississippi River.\n\nNo immediate comment from Vance on Harris picking Walz as her running mate\n\nBoarding his campaign plane Tuesday morning in Cincinnati for a swing through battleground states this week, Ohio Sen. JD Vance did not answer shouted questions about Harris picking Walz as her running mate.\n\nOn Tuesday, Vance was heading to Pennsylvania, where Harris planned to debut with her new running mate later in the day.\n\nTrump attacks Walz in a fundraising email\n\nDonald Trump sent a fundraising email calling Walz \"Dangerously Liberal\" and saying he would \"unleash HELL ON EARTH.\"\n\nMoments after Harris' VP pick became public, the former president and Republican nominee said Walz would be the worst vice president in history, claiming the Minnesota governor would \"light TRILLIONS of dollars on fire\" and open U.S. borders to criminals.\n\n\"HE'S THAT BAD,\" the email says.\n\nThe selection process that led Harris to pick Walz as her running mate\n\nA team of lawyers and political operatives led by former attorney general Eric Holder pored over documents and conducted interviews with potential vice presidential selections.\n\nAnd Harris herself met with her three finalists on Sunday. She mulled the decision over Monday with top aides at the vice president's residence in Washington and finalized it Tuesday morning.\n\nWalz emerged as the choice.\n\nA Minnesota Democratic strategist praises Walz's ability to connect with voters\n\nMinnesota Democratic strategist Abu Amara says Walz will be a good surrogate for Harris across the upper Midwest, because he represented a rural U.S. House district but won statewide in a state with large metropolitan and suburban areas.\n\n\"He's not trying to speak in poetry. He speaks in practicality,\" Amara said. \"That's a level of accessibility for so many voters.\"\n\n\"He has the ability to connect with rural, suburban and urban voters,\" he said.\n\nSome Republicans are already reacting to the selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as Harris' VP pick\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis called it the \"most left-wing ticket in American history\" and accused Walz of not doing enough to protect Minnesota during the 2020 protests over the killing of George Floyd.\n\nHe said \"Walz sat by and let Minneapolis burn.\"\n\nTropical Storm Debby continues to upend Harris' travel plans this week\n\nThe campaign had already pulled down a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, because of the weather.\n\nBut the Democratic presidential nominee will now no longer travel to Raleigh, North Carolina, either, according to the campaign. She was set to travel to Raleigh on Thursday.\n\nHarris is launching a tour of battleground states on Tuesday evening, starting in Philadelphia.\n\nHarris picks Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as running mate, AP sources say\n\nVice President Kamala Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday. That's according to three people who spoke to The Associated Press.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she's turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families. The people were not authorized to speak publicly about the choice and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.\n\n-- Seung Min Kim, Zeke Miller and Colleen Long\n\nSources say Harris has decided on a running mate\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has decided on a running mate and an announcement is expected in the coming hours before the two appear together at a Philadelphia rally, according to three people familiar with her decision.\n\nIn recent days, she has zeroed in on a trio of potential finalists: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. It wasn't clear yet who she picked.\n\nThe people were familiar with her plans but spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that had not been publicly announced.\n\nHarris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\n-- Seung Min Kim, Zeke Miller and Colleen Long\n\nHarris formally secures the Democratic presidential nomination\n\nVice President Kamala Harris formally secured the Democratic presidential nomination late Monday -- becoming the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket.\n\nHarris' nomination became official after a five-day round of online balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates ended Monday night, with the party saying in a statement released just before midnight that 99% of delegates casting ballots had done so for Harris. It said it would next formally certify the vote before holding a celebratory roll call at the party's convention later this month in Chicago.\n\nHarris' coronation as her party's standard-bearer caps a tumultuous and frenetic period for Democrats prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous June debate performance.\n\nAs soon as Biden abruptly ended his candidacy, Harris and her team worked rapidly to secure backing from the 1,976 party delegates needed to clinch the nomination in a formal roll call vote.

Tim Walz as her running mate, looking to strengthen the Democratic ticket in Midwestern states.\n\nShe introduced Walz at a rally Tuesday evening in Philadelphia.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a deadline last week. She officially claimed the nomination Monday night when the DNC released final results.\n\nFollow the AP's Election-2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nHarris and Walz take the stage\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has made her first appearance with her newly chosen running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nHarris and Walz have taken the stage together at a packed rally in Philadelphia. The pair ignited sustained cheers as they appeared before thousands at Temple University's Liacouras Center.\n\nWalz, the 60-year-old governor and former U.S. House member from rural south central Minnesota, put his hands together and bowed to the crowd. He stood alongside Harris as she waved to the audience and put her hand over her heart, wrapping the other around Walz.\n\nAccording to excerpts provided by the campaign, Walz plans to use his speech to say that Minnesota values are American values.\n\nBiden learned about Walz from Harris, not the news\n\n\"He heard it first from the vice president,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at her regular briefing. She said she couldn't \"pinpoint\" exactly where the president was when Harris called on Tuesday morning, but that he was somewhere in the executive mansion.\n\n\"She called him to let him know of her pick,\" Jean-Pierre said.\n\nHarris had sought Biden's advice during her search for a running mate, but Jean-Pierre left it there and declined to get into any specifics.\n\nBiden also spoke with Walz and congratulated him on his selection.\n\nPhiladelphia mayor calls for unity among Democrats\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker, who advocated fiercely but unsuccessfully for her state's governor, Josh Shapiro, to be Harris' running mate now says, \"Our Democratic nominee has spoken and that's it. Period. End of story.\"\n\nAt a rally in her city on Tuesday, Parker urged Pennsylvania Democrats to rally behind Harris' choice. Noting that Republicans and detractors would attempt to divide Democrats over the pick Parker says that the party can't let them.\n\nParker made headlines last week for posting a video praising Harris and Shapiro, which some thought suggested Harris had already picked Shapiro as her running mate. Instead, Harris chose Walz and the pair will appear together for the first time at the Philadelphia rally.\n\nThe last politician to face off against Tim Walz has some advice for JD Vance\n\nDr. Scott Jensen, a physician and former Republican Minnesota state senator, was the last political candidate to run against Walz in a general election but lost by nearly 8 points. Jensen says Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance should be prepared for Walz's fast-talking debate style. He also thinks Walz's appeal in rural areas has been overstated.\n\n\"Tim Walz can talk around a topic extremely effectively. He will give people the impression that he is the candidate of the common, everyday person,\" Jensen said. \"But if you look at the results of the 2022 election, Tim Walz really won the election because of the Twin Cities, Duluth and Rochester.\"\n\nHe also pointed out that in the 2022 governor's race, Walz lost many of the counties in the district he previously represented in Congress.\n\n\"Tim Walz lost the district in which the people who knew him best were offered the opportunity to make a decision about his candidacy,\" Jensen said. \"I think that's telling.\"\n\nTrump will sit for an interview with Elon Musk\n\nTrump says that he will do an interview with billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk next week. Musk endorsed the Republican for president after Trump survived an assassination attempt.\n\n\"ON MONDAY NIGHT I'LL BE DOING A MAJOR INTERVIEW WITH ELON MUSK -- Details to follow!\" Trump posted on his social media network.\n\nHis campaign did not immediately have more details to share.\n\nTrump, a longtime opponent of electric cars, said over the weekend at his rally in Atlanta that he favors electric cars \"for a small slice\" of the population, saying, \"I have to be, you know, because Elon endorsed me very strongly.\" He added: \"So I have no choice.\"\n\nExpect Walz to extol Harris during his first running mate appearance\n\nAhead of a rally in Philadelphia, the Harris campaign has released experts of Walz's prepared remarks where he'll introduce himself to the nation, highlight his support for Harris and emphasize stopping Trump at the ballot.\n\nWalz will say that the vice president \"has fought on the side of the American people\" and \"brings joy to everything she does.\"\n\n\"Minnesota's strength comes from our values -- our commitment to working together, to seeing past our differences, to lending a helping hand,\" Walz plans to tell the rally. \"Donald Trump -- he sees the world differently. He doesn't know the first thing about service -- because he's too busy serving himself.\"\n\nThe phone call that sealed the deal\n\nWearing khakis and a camouflage baseball cap, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz accepted a phone call from Vice President Kamala Harris. The Harris campaign has posted a video of the call on social media.\n\n\"Hi, this is Tim,\" Walz said into his phone.\n\n\"It's Kamala Harris. Good morning, governor,\" the Democratic nominee said with a big smile. \"Listen, I want you to do this with me. Let's do this together. Would you be my running mate?\"\n\n\"I would be honored, madame vice president,\" Walz said.\n\nThe two exchanged pleasantries over the roughly minute-long video and Harris ended the call with an, \"All right, buddy. I'll see you soon. Take care.\"\n\nThe campaign said it has raised more than $10 million from \"grassroots supporters alone\" since Walz became her running mate.\n\nVoter Voices: 'I was open for whoever she picked'\n\nMarnie Fowler, a 44-year-old Philadelphia who works in concert touring, wore a blue T-shirt she recently purchased online that said: \"Childless Cat Lady,\" a reference to remarks by GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance. Farlow said she wanted Walz all along. \"He's America's dad,\" Farlow said. \"Everything he's done in Minnesota aligns with my values.\"\n\nCheryl Pitts, a 77-year-old retired state worker from Sicklerville, New Jersey, said she was \"a little bit\" disappointed that Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro wasn't picked, \"but it won't stop us from voting; it didn't diminish my excitement.\" She called Walz \"a regular kind of guy that I can believe what he says.\"\n\nBernie Strain, 66, wore a shirt he made himself for the rally that said: \"OLD WHITE MEN FOR HARRIS & FREEDOM.\" Strain said he'd met Shapiro through politics but was ready to support whoever Harris selected. \"I was open for whoever she picked,\" he said. \"I was going to support them with both feet.\"\n\nA Republican strategist actually praising Harris' VP pick\n\nMark Campbell is a rare Republican who's publicly praising Harris' choice of Walz, calling it \"a home run.\"\n\nCampbell, a veteran GOP strategist who managed Glenn Youngkin's winning 2021 Virginia governor's campaign, ticked through a number of areas he suggests Walz reinforces Harris, first as an authentic surrogate in the northern battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nAn enlisted Army veteran, \"not officer class,\" Walz is \"plainspoken, folksy in a way that will play well in the burbs and rural areas,\" Cambell said.\n\nHe's \"progressive, but not too far from center,\" he said, and will align with \"Harris on policy 90% of the time.\" Campbell called the selection \"rock steady.\"\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says Walz is a good pick for Harris' running mate\n\nBeshear said it was \"a true honor of a lifetime\" to be considered for Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate and that\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz was a good pick.\n\n\"He is a great friend,\" Beshear told reporters outside his office in the Kentucky Capitol on Tuesday afternoon. \"He'd be an amazing vice president. I am 100% onboard with doing everything I can to elect the Harris-Walz ticket this November.\"\n\nBeshear declined to comment on the process -- when he was interviewed for the job and if he heard from Harris or her team Tuesday morning.\n\nMan who owned rights to HarrisWalz.com says he's sold the domain; declined to name the buyer\n\nJeremy Green Eche, the trademark lawyer who purchased HarrisWalz.com for $8.99 in 2020, sold the domain - and a slate of others linked to Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris - on Tuesday for $15,000, he told The Associated Press shortly after the order was made.\n\nEche declined to say who bought the domains, but said they have \"no obvious connection to either campaign or anything political.\"\n\nHarris selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate Tuesday.\n\nEche bought the rights to the site and others in 2020 when the would-be vice president was in the midst of a primary campaign for president. When he learned Walz was the pick, Eche was particularly excited, both because the Harris supporter liked Walz best out of the men the vice president was considering, and because it meant someone paying his $15,000 asking price was more likely.\n\nNow that the site was sold, however, Eche says he feels glad but odd.\n\n\"I feel strange,\" he said, \"like it happened too soon.\"\n\nThe domains were sold on the website for Eche's start-up, Communer, a forum that allows people to buy and sell domains and trademarks online. Eche said the website will now draw up a domain transfer contract between himself and the buyer.\n\nGroup founded by Republican women opposed to Trump support Walz\n\nA group founded in June by current and former Republican women who oppose Donald Trump for president came out in favor of Walz as Harris' pick, in part for Walz's fiscal measures and policy accomplishments aimed at women.\n\n\"As Governor, he's cut taxes for the middle class while balancing the budget, supported paid family leave so new mothers can be home to care for their children, expanded access to pre-kindergarten, and make sure that no Minnesotan child goes hungry at school,\" a release from Women4U.S. states.\n\nThe group is a federal superPAC whose honorary advisers include former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, former New Hampshire Republican Chair Jennifer Horn and founding editor of The Weekly Standard, Bill Kristol.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi welcomes Walz to the race\n\nSpeaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi welcomed the Minnesotan to what she called the Harris-Walz \"freedom ticket.\"\n\n\"In the Congress, I saw firsthand Tim Walz's leadership, collaborative spirit and effectiveness in bringing people together and getting the job done,\" Pelosi said in a statement.\n\nThe former Democratic House speaker was pivotal in reshaping the presidential race as President Joe Biden stepped aside and she said the field of potential VP candidates \"demonstrated the strength and vitality of the next generation of Democratic leadership.\"\n\nWisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin: 'We're thrilled to see a fellow Midwesterner at the top of the ticket'\n\nIt didn't take Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin long to seize on Harris' selection of Walz as a fundraising tool for her competitive reelection campaign.\n\n\"We're thrilled to see a fellow Midwesterner at the top of the ticket,\" Baldwin said in a fundraising email sent late Tuesday morning.\n\nBaldwin, seeking a third term, is among several incumbent Democratic senators seeking reelection in states viewed as pivotal to the presidential campaign, and where an uptick in enthusiasm since Harris' takeover of Joe Biden's campaign has lifted the party's hope of holding the seat.\n\nBaldwin spoke at Harris' first campaign stop as a candidate last month, an upbeat rally in suburban Milwaukee.\n\n\"Wisconsin has emerged as the tipping point state that will determine who wins the White House and which party controls the Senate,\" Baldwin's email said.\n\nBiden carried Wisconsin in 2020 by fewer than 21,000 votes.\n\nVoto Latino co-founder says Walz as running mate will help energize Latino voters\n\nVoto Latino co-founder and President Maria Teresa Kumar said Walz's selection to the ticket would help energize Latino voters who want a more inclusive democracy.\n\nKumar said in a statement that Walz's \"strong record of defending democracy, protecting voting rights, and standing up for working families in Minnesota aligns perfectly with the values our organization and the Latino community hold dear.\"\n\nShe added that she knows the vice president and governor personally and knows they'll represent a powerful voice for \"progress, equality and opportunity for Latino communities and all Americans.\"\n\nSen. Mark Kelly urges supporters to contribute to the Harris-Walz ticket\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly said he and his wife, former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, will do everything they can to elect Harris and Walz after Kelly was passed over for the Democratic ticket.\n\nKelly sent an email to supporters urging them to contribute to the Harris-Walz ticket.\n\n\"Tim has years of experience representing Minnesota both in the House of Representatives, where he served with Gabby, and as Minnesota's governor,\" Kelly wrote. \"In that time, he has shown up time and time again for working families and I know he'll continue that work in the White House.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the head of GIFFORDS, a gun-control advocacy group founded by Kelly and Giffords, called Walz \"a strong gun safety champion.\"\n\n\"Gun violence is a top concern for Americans this election cycle and we know the Harris-Walz ticket is the only one that will stand up to the gun lobby and save lives,\" said GIFFORDS Executive Director Emma Brown, who managed Kelly's 2022 Senate campaign and was his deputy campaign manager when in his first race two years earlier 2020.\n\nVance blames Harris' policies for drug addiction deaths\n\nVance is aiming to tie what he portrays as Harris' failures along the U.S.-Mexico border to deaths from drug addiction.\n\nVance told several hundred supporters gathered in a South Philadelphia event space that, \"thanks to the policies of Kamala Harris, you've got children who've been orphaned\" when their parents die from drugs.\n\nSeveral Pennsylvanians shared personal stories of how addiction issues have impacted their families.\n\nAs he has over several speeches and interviews in recent weeks, Vance told his own story related to drug addition, noting that his mother has been drug-free for a decade but, as a child, he was \"desperately hoping and praying, Jesus, please let her wake up from this.\"\n\nU.S. government data undercuts the claim that people seeking asylum and other border crossers are responsible for drug trafficking. At a hearing last year, James Mandryck, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection deputy assistant commissioner, said 73% of fentanyl seizures at the border since the previous October were smuggling attempts carried out by U.S. citizens, with the rest being done by Mexican citizens.\n\nBarack and Michelle Obama say Harris 'has chosen an ideal partner'\n\n\"Governor Walz doesn't just have the experience to be vice president, he has the values and the integrity to make us proud,\" the former president and first lady said in a statement.\n\nThey said Walz enacted progressive priorities as Minnesota governor including paid family leave, abortion rights and gun safety measures.\n\n\"But Tim's signature is his ability to talk like a human being and treat everyone with decency and respect,\" the Obamas said.\n\nVance says he tried to get Walz on the phone\n\nThe Republican told reporters aboard his campaign plane Tuesday that he called Walz earlier in the day but \"I left him a voicemail, I didn't get him.\"\n\nIt's not clear if there will be a debate between Vance and Walz. Last week, Trump said he wouldn't take part in an ABC News debate that had been on the books for September because he made that agreement with Biden before the president exited the campaign.\n\nInstead, Trump said he would debate Harris on Sept. 4 on Fox News, but the vice president hasn't agreed to that time or network yet.\n\nPresident Joe Biden calls Harris-Walz ticket 'a powerful voice for working people' and middle class\n\nBiden called on Democrats and all Americans to rally behind them.\n\n\"They will be the strongest defenders of our personal freedoms and our democracy,\" Biden said in a social media post. \"And they will ensure that America continues to lead the world and play its role as the indispensable nation.\"\n\nBiden said choosing a running mate is a party nominee's first major decision and praised Harris' choice. He said he's known Walz for nearly two decades, praising his background as a teacher, football coach and National Guard soldier.\n\n\"Every generation of Americans faces a moment where they are asked to defend American democracy,\" Biden said. \"That moment is now.\"\n\nWhite House Senior Deputy Press Secretary Emilie Simons says Biden and Harris spoke on the phone Tuesday morning ahead of the official announcement that she selected Walz and that Biden spoke with Walz to congratulate him.\n\nVance says Walz pick as running mate 'highlights how radical' Harris is\n\nIn his first public comments since his general election foe was set, JD Vance on Tuesday called Walz a choice that \"highlights how radical Kamala Harris is.\"\n\nIn a gaggle with reporters aboard his campaign plane upon landing in Philadelphia, Vance said Walz \"is a person who listens to the Hamas wing\" of the Democratic Party and \"who wants to make the American people more reliant on garbage energy instead of good American energy.\"\n\nVance is speaking more to reporters in Philadelphia on Tuesday ahead of campaign events across Midwestern battleground states on Wednesday, in a path that somewhat mirrors Harris and Walz's planned trajectory.\n\nFormer colleagues on Capitol Hill appear thrilled with Walz as the VP pick\n\n\"Great choice,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\n\"Having served for years with Tim in the House of Representatives, I can say without reservation: there's no better person Vice President Harris could have picked to run and then govern alongside her,\" said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md.\n\nWalz \"has always put our country first,\" Van Hollen said, and he's excited to campaign for the Harris-Walz ticket for \"a brighter future for all Americans.\"\n\nRep. Mark Takano of California recalled how after Walz beat him during an internal House caucus vote to become the top Democrat on the Veterans Affairs Committee, his colleague \"immediately brought me into the fold because that's the type of leader he is: a collaborative bridge builder.\"\n\nAnd Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, who entered Congress with Walz in 2007, said he \"has always had this very straightforward, direct, open approach to things.\"\n\nWelch described Walz as \"one of these guys in the gym who wouldn't undo his tie\" because it would be faster for him to get back to work.\n\nPolling shows the appeal of Tim Walz's biography\n\nTim Walz's biography as a military veteran and former high school teacher - two broadly trusted professions - may also help him appeal to Americans as he campaigns with Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAbout 9 in 10 U.S. adults say they have a favorable opinion of military veterans, generally, according to an Ipsos poll conducted in 2024. About 8 in 10 say that about school teachers. Both measures are much higher than for government employees or elected officials. Republicans are slightly more likely than Democrats to have a positive view of veterans, while Democrats are a bit more likely to have a favorable opinion of those in a teaching career.\n\nGallup polling from 2022 found that high school teachers are generally held in high regard among Americans for their honesty and ethical standards. About half, 53%, gave them at least a high rating on ethics.\n\nAP VoteCast shows Tim Walz's electoral strengths and weakness in Minnesota\n\nDemocratic nominee Kamala Harris is hoping her VP choice, Tim Walz, will strengthen the Democratic ticket in Midwestern states and among working class voters.\n\nAP VoteCast shows that when Walz was elected Minnesota governor in 2022, he won young voters in the state. He also did well in Minnesota's union households, winning nearly 6 in 10 voters in that group. About half of Minnesota voters, 52%, had a favorable view of Walz, and about 4 in 10 had a negative one.\n\nAnd while Walz lost white voters without a college education in the state, he outperformed Democrats nationwide with this group. He also struggled among white men, a demographic Democrats have sought to win back from President Donald Trump, but did a little better among this group than Democrats nationwide.\n\nHowever, Walz lost among military veteran households in Minnesota in 2022, according to VoteCast.\n\nTim Walz will need to introduce himself to America\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz will need to introduce himself to the vast majority of Americans.\n\nAn ABC News/Ipsos survey conducted before Walz was selected as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, but after vetting began, showed that nearly 9 in 10 U.S. adults did not know enough to have an opinion about him. Among Americans with a view, opinions were split between positive and negative: 6% had a favorable view, and 7% had an unfavorable one.\n\nWalz's lack of a national profile as he joins Harris on the campaign trail extends to his own party. Nearly 9 in 10 Democrats also didn't know enough to have an opinion of Walz in the ABC News/Ipsos poll. One in 10 had a favorable view of him, and just 4% had a negative opinion. He was an unknown figure among most Democrats across the party: those older and younger were similarly likely to not know Walz, as well as white Democrats and non-white Democrats.\n\nFellow Minnesotan Sen. Amy Klobuchar says Walz is 'just unendingly optimistic and joyous'\n\nU.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar says Walz is someone who is \"just unendingly optimistic and joyous, and that is very, very important right now in our politics.\"\n\nThe fellow Minnesotan who served with Walz in Congress told The Associated Press \"he's blunt, but he's also positive\" in a way she believes will provide an upbeat message in contrast to the Trump-Vance Republican ticket.\n\n\"I always think of him in his plaid shirt because he was always making the point it's 'One Minnesota,'\" said Klobuchar, a Democrat. \"And I think that's a point you're going hear him talk about with our nation.\"\n\nShe said his background as a hunter and someone who fishes \"just brings a different perspective to the White House.\"\n\nSeveral black and white SUVs have left the Governor's residence in St. Paul\n\nThe SUVs left amid cheers from residents lined up on the sidewalk.\n\nHarris' running mate pick is good news for man who owns rights to HarrisWalz.com\n\nJeremy Green Eche was in the middle of getting his toddler dressed the moment news broke that Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris had selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate.\n\nAnd he was amped.\n\nEche was uniquely invested in Harris' pick. He currently owns the rights to HarrisWalz.com, a site he bought in 2020 -- along with a slate of other Harris sites -- when the would-be vice president was in the midst of a primary campaign for president. Four years and one vice presidential pick later, Eche is willing to sell the slate of Harris websites, including the one featuring Walz, for $15,000.\n\n\"I was constantly refreshing four different news sites on my phone,\" he told The Associated Press on Tuesday. \"I was very excited.\" He said he \"almost immediately\" began getting calls from both journalists and \"friends I hadn't heard from in a while.\"\n\nThis is not a new scenario for the 36-year-old trademark lawyer in Brooklyn, New York. Eche is a cyber squatter, someone who buys a domain with someone else's name or brand in it for very little money, hoping to sell it to that person or brand for a large profit in the subsequent months or years. In 2011, when it looked likely that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would be the Democratic nominee in 2016, then Jeremy Peter Green - he took his wife's last name - purchased ClintonKaine.com.\n\nAfter the former secretary of state picked Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, the squatter offered it to the campaign for a hefty return. They declined, so he sold it for $15,000 to a digital marketing company that turned out to be the Trump campaign. The website pushed anti-Clinton news with \"Paid for by Donald J. Trump for President, Inc\" emblazoned at the bottom.\n\nEche supported Clinton in 2016 and supports Harris today. The prospect of something like that happening again doesn't give Eche pause, however.\n\n\"The Harris campaign has hundreds of millions of dollars, so if they don't buy their own domain, that is kind of on them,\" he said Monday. But he isn't convinced they will buy the domain.\n\n\"I don't want to be too confident that somebody will reach out,\" he said after Walz was selected. \"I would say there's a 75% chance that one of the campaigns, or a PAC, will buy it from me.\"\n\nWalz says he's 'all in'\n\nIn a Tuesday morning post on X, Walz said joining the ticket with Harris is \"the honor of a lifetime.\"\n\nHis profile details on X are now \"Running to win this thing with @kamalaharris.\"\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro on Walz\n\nShapiro called Walz \"an exceptionally strong addition to the ticket\" who'll help Harris become the 47th president.\n\nShapiro, who met with Harris on Sunday about the job, said he was grateful to talk about \"her vision for the role and the campaign ahead.\"\n\n\"As I've said repeatedly over the past several weeks, the running mate decision was a deeply personal decision for the vice president - and it was also a deeply personal decision for me. Pennsylvanians elected me to a four-year term as their governor, and my work here is far from finished - there is a lot more stuff I want to get done for the good people of this commonwealth,\" Shapiro said in a statement.\n\nHe said he considers Walz a good friend and pledged to travel the state over the next three months to help Democrats defeat former President Donald Trump \"and build a better future for our country.\"\n\n\"Vice President Kamala Harris has my enthusiastic support - and I know that Governor Tim Walz is an exceptionally strong addition to the ticket who will help Kamala move our country forward,\" Shapiro said.\n\nAt the Governor's mansion, a Minnesota resident says why he likes Walz\n\nDavid Ivory, 46, stood outside the Governor's mansion with his two children. Ivory found out Walz was selected after his wife texted him \"OMG\" from work.\n\nHe and his kids immediately hopped on their bikes and rode to the Governor's residence in St. Paul.\n\nIvory and his family are longtime admirers of Walz for his liberal record and amiable political persona.\n\n\"He's just down to earth. He gets it. He can talk to anybody,\" Ivory said. \"He doesn't seem like he's above anybody. He was a teacher. He understands kids, which is very important.\"\n\nHarris says her new running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has 'delivered for working families'\n\n\"It's great to have him on the team,\" Harris said.\n\nHarris posted on X that she was proud to announce she asked Walz to join her on the 2024 ticket.\n\nVoter Coalition Pushes Issue-Based Outreach Strategy to Increase Registration, Shifting from Top of Ticket Politics\n\nState Voices launched a $3 million nationwide campaign Tuesday to encourage voters of color to vote based on the issues that affect their day-to-day lives, like grocery price spikes or growing rent and mortgage payments.\n\nUnder the Vote for Something campaign, the coalition aims to register 800,000 voters, make more than 250 million voter contacts, and encourage 100,000 people to make a plan to vote on or ahead of the 2024 election for themselves and others.\n\nThey've registered more than 400,000 voters so far.\n\nState Voices, like many voting rights advocates, hopes for messaging that transcends the top of the ticket -- a looming match between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\"Whatever the issue is that matters to you, vote for something. Get out this November and bring a friend and a family member with you,\" said Mishara Davis, the group's director of issue and electoral organizing.\n\nThe key has been reaching voters who may be tired of the political space altogether or who are eligible to vote but aren't registered and therefore may not receive voting information -- especially in presidential swing states, Georgia, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, which are primary areas under the campaign.\n\nThis comes as Harris, who is in Pennsylvania this week, has chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, sources say. The pair will continue the campaign tour to Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada starting Wednesday.\n\nEnvironmental group cheers selection of Walz as the Democratic vice presidential candidate\n\nManish Bapna, president and CEO of the NRDC Action Fund, the political arm of the Natural Resources Defense Council, called Harris and Walz \"the winning ticket on climate. The Harris-Walz administration will be ready, on day one, to build on the strongest climate action ever and lead by example in the global fight against the existential challenge of our time.''\n\nWalz has made Minnesota a national climate leader, Bapna said. Under his leadership, the state committed to 100% clean energy by 2040, and Minnesota was the first Midwestern state to adopt California's strict tailpipe emissions standards. Walz also signed a bill last year directing $240 million to replace lead service water lines statewide.\n\n\"The stakes in this election couldn't be higher nor the choice more clear. Trump would bow to billionaire oil and gas donors, slam climate progress into reverse and leave our kids to pay the price. Harris is a proven climate and justice leader with two decades of public service on the front lines of needed progress and change. She's shown us what leadership looks like, and she's earned the chance to lead,\" Bapna said.\n\nThe National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund praises Walz's selection\n\n\"The National LGBTQ Action Fund expected a strategic and bold choice as a strong addition to the ticket as a Vice-Presidential candidate,\" Sayre E. Reece, vice president of the National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, said Tuesday in a statement. \"In Governor Walz we have gotten both.\"\n\nReece continued: \"Governor Walz has been a steadfast ally and advocate for the LGBTQ community, including support for trans affirming care, bodily autonomy and reproductive freedom and gun control. As Governor, Walz signed a ban on so-called 'conversion therapy' into law, ending the harmful and cruel practice that has cost LGBTQ people their dignity and their lives. Under Walz's leadership, Minnesota is both a 'trans sanctuary' and immigration sanctuary state.\"\n\nThe National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund describes itself as lobbying for legislation and ballot initiatives that \"achieve justice\" for LGBTQ people.\n\nAt Walz's residence in Minnesota\n\nA growing crowd of residents and news reporters gathered outside Walz's residence in St. Paul, Minnesota, on Tuesday morning.\n\nBlack and white SUVs periodically pulled into the driveway as onlookers waited to catch a glimpse of Walz leaving the 20-room governor's mansion near the Mississippi River.\n\nNo immediate comment from Vance on Harris picking Walz as her running mate\n\nBoarding his campaign plane Tuesday morning in Cincinnati for a swing through battleground states this week, Ohio Sen. JD Vance did not answer shouted questions about Harris picking Walz as her running mate.\n\nOn Tuesday, Vance was heading to Pennsylvania, where Harris planned to debut with her new running mate later in the day.\n\nTrump attacks Walz in a fundraising email\n\nDonald Trump sent a fundraising email calling Walz \"Dangerously Liberal\" and saying he would \"unleash HELL ON EARTH.\"\n\nMoments after Harris' VP pick became public, the former president and Republican nominee said Walz would be the worst vice president in history, claiming the Minnesota governor would \"light TRILLIONS of dollars on fire\" and open U.S. borders to criminals.\n\n\"HE'S THAT BAD,\" the email says.\n\nThe selection process that led Harris to pick Walz as her running mate\n\nA team of lawyers and political operatives led by former attorney general Eric Holder pored over documents and conducted interviews with potential vice presidential selections.\n\nAnd Harris herself met with her three finalists on Sunday. She mulled the decision over Monday with top aides at the vice president's residence in Washington and finalized it Tuesday morning.\n\nWalz emerged as the choice.\n\nA Minnesota Democratic strategist praises Walz's ability to connect with voters\n\nMinnesota Democratic strategist Abu Amara says Walz will be a good surrogate for Harris across the upper Midwest, because he represented a rural U.S. House district but won statewide in a state with large metropolitan and suburban areas.\n\n\"He's not trying to speak in poetry. He speaks in practicality,\" Amara said. \"That's a level of accessibility for so many voters.\"\n\n\"He has the ability to connect with rural, suburban and urban voters,\" he said.\n\nSome Republicans are already reacting to the selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as Harris' VP pick\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis called it the \"most left-wing ticket in American history\" and accused Walz of not doing enough to protect Minnesota during the 2020 protests over the killing of George Floyd.\n\nHe said \"Walz sat by and let Minneapolis burn.\"\n\nTropical Storm Debby continues to upend Harris' travel plans this week\n\nThe campaign had already pulled down a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, because of the weather.\n\nBut the Democratic presidential nominee will now no longer travel to Raleigh, North Carolina, either, according to the campaign. She was set to travel to Raleigh on Thursday.\n\nHarris is launching a tour of battleground states on Tuesday evening, starting in Philadelphia.\n\nHarris picks Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as running mate, AP sources say\n\nVice President Kamala Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday. That's according to three people who spoke to The Associated Press.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she's turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families. The people were not authorized to speak publicly about the choice and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.\n\n-- Seung Min Kim, Zeke Miller and Colleen Long\n\nSources say Harris has decided on a running mate\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has decided on a running mate and an announcement is expected in the coming hours before the two appear together at a Philadelphia rally, according to three people familiar with her decision.\n\nIn recent days, she has zeroed in on a trio of potential finalists: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. It wasn't clear yet who she picked.\n\nThe people were familiar with her plans but spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that had not been publicly announced.\n\nHarris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\n-- Seung Min Kim, Zeke Miller and Colleen Long\n\nHarris formally secures the Democratic presidential nomination\n\nVice President Kamala Harris formally secured the Democratic presidential nomination late Monday -- becoming the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket.\n\nHarris' nomination became official after a five-day round of online balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates ended Monday night, with the party saying in a statement released just before midnight that 99% of delegates casting ballots had done so for Harris. It said it would next formally certify the vote before holding a celebratory roll call at the party's convention later this month in Chicago.\n\nHarris' coronation as her party's standard-bearer caps a tumultuous and frenetic period for Democrats prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous June debate performance.\n\nAs soon as Biden abruptly ended his candidacy, Harris and her team worked rapidly to secure backing from the 1,976 party delegates needed to clinch the nomination in a formal roll call vote. She reached that marker at warp speed, with an Associated Press survey of delegates nationwide showing she locked down the necessary commitments a mere 32 hours after Biden's announcement.\n\nMore from this section\n\nGoogle illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules\n\nKamala Harris introduces Minnesota Gov.

Tim Walz will be her running mate in the 2024 presidential election increased the spread of false claims about the Midwestern Democrat, some of which appeared on social media even before Harris made her pick public.\n\nCLAIM: Walz said on CNN that he wants to invest in a \"ladder factory\" to help people scale the wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and illegally enter the U.S.\n\nTHE FACTS: That's false. Posts are misrepresenting a comment Walz made on an episode of CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360\" last week. In the full segment, the Democrat criticizes former President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall on the southern border by joking about the hypothetical investment. He then gives multiple other examples of how to address illegal crossings into the U.S. through Mexico.\n\nAmid Harris' Tuesday announcement, social media users used a clip from the segment to make it seem as though the Minnesota governor was advocating for illegal immigration.\n\n\"He talks about this wall, I always say, 'let me know how high it is, if it's 25 feet then I'll invest in a 30-foot-ladder factory,'\" Walz says, referencing Trump. \"That's not how you stop this.\"\n\nOne X post that shared the clip reads: \"FLASHBACK: Kamala's VP pick, Tim Walz, says he should invest in a 'ladder factory' to help illegal aliens climb the border wall.\"\n\nBut Walz was not offering to help people enter the U.S. without authorization. He was actually discussing how to prevent this from happening.\n\nIn the full segment, after making the investment quip, Walz gives alternative ideas for how to handle illegal crossings on the southern border. Arrests for such crossings reached a record high in December, but dropped to a new low for the Biden administration at the end of July following a temporary ban on asylum.\n\n\"You stop this using electronics, you stop it using more border control agents and you stop it by having a legal system that allows for that tradition of allowing folks to come here just like my relatives did,\" Walz says near the end of the segment. \"To come here, be able to work and establish the American dream.\"\n\nHe also spoke in support of a bipartisan border security package intended to cut back on illegal crossings that the Senate voted down in February.\n\n-- Associated Press writer Melissa Goldin contributed this report.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: Walz changed the Minnesota flag so that it resembles the Somali flag.\n\nTHE FACTS: Minnesota did unfurl a new state flag and accompanying seal in May, but the changes were made to replace an old design that Native Americans said reminded them of painful memories of conquest and displacement. The State Emblems Redesign Commission was established during the 2023 legislative session to oversee the development of a new design.\n\nChanges were made to eliminate an old state seal that featured the image of a Native American riding off into the sunset while a white settler plowed his field with a rifle at the ready. The seal was a key feature of the old flag.\n\nThe commission included public officials, design experts and members of tribal and other communities of color. Its purpose statement dictated that the designs \"must accurately and respectfully reflect Minnesota's shared history, resources, and diverse cultural communities. Symbols, emblems, or likenesses that represent only a single community or person, regardless of whether real or stylized, may not be included in a design.\"\n\nThe public submitted more than 2,600 proposals and the commission picked one from Andrew Prekker, 25, of Luverne, as the basis for the flag.\n\nPrekker said Walz had nothing to do with the creation of the flag, and Somalia had nothing to do with the flag design. Minnesota is home to the largest Somali population in the U.S. and is home to U.S. Rep. Ilhan Oman, who was born in Somalia and is a member of an informal group of progressive Democratic House members known as The Squad.\n\n\"The inspiration behind my flag were three main concepts inspired by Minnesota's history and culture: The North Star, the Minnesota shape, and three stripes representing different facets of Minnesotan identity,\" he wrote in an email.\n\nPrekker's original design had the white star on the blue background with white, green and light blue stripes stretching over the rest of the flag. The flag was compared online with flags from states in Somalia that have green, white and blue stripes and a star. The stripes were dropped by the commission in the final design.\n\nThe final version of the flag features a dark blue shape resembling Minnesota with a white, eight-pointed star on it. The right side is light blue and is meant to symbolize the state's abundant waters that led to it being known as the Land of 10,000 Lakes.\n\nThe Somali flag has a five-point star on a light blue background. \"There is no connection to Somalia or any other country, and in complete honesty I didn't even know Somalia existed before the whole flag debacle. Any similarities people want to see are a coincidence. It is a Minnesotan flag, and that is what I designed it for,\" Prekker said."],"source":{"uri":["trentonian.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["The Trentonian"]},"authors":[{"uri":["associated_press@trentonian.com"],"name":["Associated Press"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://www.trentonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Election_2024_Harris_82514.jpg?w=640"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[-0.0353],"wgt":[460680246],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["2024-08-446231527"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-06"],"time":["22:43:41"],"dateTime":["2024-08-06T22:43:41Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-06T22:00:00Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.7333],"url":["https://greekreporter.com/2024/08/07/musk-ai-misinformation-biden/"],"title":["Musk's AI Spread Misinformation After Biden Dropped Out, Officials Claim"],"body":["On Monday, five secretaries of state urged Elon Musk to fix the AI search assistant on his social media platform X.

Trump's false attacks on Vice President Kamala Harris' Black identity have worried top Republicans that Trump may lose a campaign they still see as favorable for him. They say he should focus solely on the economy and immigration.\n\nBy The Associated Press\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, looking to strengthen the Democratic ticket in Midwestern states.\n\nShe introduced Walz at a rally Tuesday evening in Philadelphia.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a deadline last week.

Tim Walz.\n\nHarris and Walz have taken the stage together at a packed rally in Philadelphia. The pair ignited sustained cheers as they appeared before thousands at Temple University's Liacouras Center.\n\nWalz, the 60-year-old governor and former U.S. House member from rural south central Minnesota, put his hands together and bowed to the crowd. He stood alongside Harris as she waved to the audience and put her hand over her heart, wrapping the other around Walz.\n\nAccording to excerpts provided by the campaign, Walz plans to use his speech to say that Minnesota values are American values.\n\nBiden learned about Walz from Harris, not the news\n\n\"He heard it first from the vice president,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at her regular briefing. She said she couldn't \"pinpoint\" exactly where the president was when Harris called on Tuesday morning, but that he was somewhere in the executive mansion.\n\n\"She called him to let him know of her pick,\" Jean-Pierre said.\n\nHarris had sought Biden's advice during her search for a running mate, but Jean-Pierre left it there and declined to get into any specifics.\n\nBiden also spoke with Walz and congratulated him on his selection.\n\nPhiladelphia mayor calls for unity among Democrats\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker, who advocated fiercely but unsuccessfully for her state's governor, Josh Shapiro, to be Harris' running mate now says, \"Our Democratic nominee has spoken and that's it. Period. End of story.\"\n\nAt a rally in her city on Tuesday, Parker urged Pennsylvania Democrats to rally behind Harris' choice. Noting that Republicans and detractors would attempt to divide Democrats over the pick Parker says that the party can't let them.\n\nParker made headlines last week for posting a video praising Harris and Shapiro, which some thought suggested Harris had already picked Shapiro as her running mate. Instead, Harris chose Walz and the pair will appear together for the first time at the Philadelphia rally.\n\nThe last politician to face off against Tim Walz has some advice for JD Vance\n\nDr. Scott Jensen, a physician and former Republican Minnesota state senator, was the last political candidate to run against Walz in a general election but lost by nearly 8 points. Jensen says Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance should be prepared for Walz's fast-talking debate style. He also thinks Walz's appeal in rural areas has been overstated.\n\n\"Tim Walz can talk around a topic extremely effectively. He will give people the impression that he is the candidate of the common, everyday person,\" Jensen said. \"But if you look at the results of the 2022 election, Tim Walz really won the election because of the Twin Cities, Duluth and Rochester.\"\n\nHe also pointed out that in the 2022 governor's race, Walz lost many of the counties in the district he previously represented in Congress.\n\n\"Tim Walz lost the district in which the people who knew him best were offered the opportunity to make a decision about his candidacy,\" Jensen said. \"I think that's telling.\"\n\nTrump will sit for an interview with Elon Musk\n\nTrump says that he will do an interview with billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk next week. Musk endorsed the Republican for president after Trump survived an assassination attempt.\n\n\"ON MONDAY NIGHT I'LL BE DOING A MAJOR INTERVIEW WITH ELON MUSK -- Details to follow!\" Trump posted on his social media network.\n\nHis campaign did not immediately have more details to share.\n\nTrump, a longtime opponent of electric cars, said over the weekend at his rally in Atlanta that he favors electric cars \"for a small slice\" of the population, saying, \"I have to be, you know, because Elon endorsed me very strongly.\" He added: \"So I have no choice.\"\n\nExpect Walz to extol Harris during his first running mate appearance\n\nAhead of a rally in Philadelphia, the Harris campaign has released experts of Walz's prepared remarks where he'll introduce himself to the nation, highlight his support for Harris and emphasize stopping Trump at the ballot.\n\nWalz will say that the vice president \"has fought on the side of the American people\" and \"brings joy to everything she does.\"\n\n\"Minnesota's strength comes from our values -- our commitment to working together, to seeing past our differences, to lending a helping hand,\" Walz plans to tell the rally. \"Donald Trump -- he sees the world differently. He doesn't know the first thing about service -- because he's too busy serving himself.\"\n\nThe phone call that sealed the deal\n\nWearing khakis and a camouflage baseball cap, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz accepted a phone call from Vice President Kamala Harris. The Harris campaign has posted a video of the call on social media.\n\n\"Hi, this is Tim,\" Walz said into his phone.\n\n\"It's Kamala Harris. Good morning, governor,\" the Democratic nominee said with a big smile. \"Listen, I want you to do this with me. Let's do this together. Would you be my running mate?\"\n\n\"I would be honored, madame vice president,\" Walz said.\n\nThe two exchanged pleasantries over the roughly minute-long video and Harris ended the call with an, \"All right, buddy. I'll see you soon. Take care.\"\n\nThe campaign said it has raised more than $10 million from \"grassroots supporters alone\" since Walz became her running mate.\n\nVoter Voices: 'I was open for whoever she picked'\n\nMarnie Fowler, a 44-year-old Philadelphia who works in concert touring, wore a blue T-shirt she recently purchased online that said: \"Childless Cat Lady,\" a reference to remarks by GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance. Farlow said she wanted Walz all along. \"He's America's dad,\" Farlow said. \"Everything he's done in Minnesota aligns with my values.\"\n\nCheryl Pitts, a 77-year-old retired state worker from Sicklerville, New Jersey, said she was \"a little bit\" disappointed that Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro wasn't picked, \"but it won't stop us from voting; it didn't diminish my excitement.\" She called Walz \"a regular kind of guy that I can believe what he says.\"\n\nBernie Strain, 66, wore a shirt he made himself for the rally that said: \"OLD WHITE MEN FOR HARRIS & FREEDOM.\" Strain said he'd met Shapiro through politics but was ready to support whoever Harris selected. \"I was open for whoever she picked,\" he said. \"I was going to support them with both feet.\"\n\nA Republican strategist actually praising Harris' VP pick\n\nMark Campbell is a rare Republican who's publicly praising Harris' choice of Walz, calling it \"a home run.\"\n\nCampbell, a veteran GOP strategist who managed Glenn Youngkin's winning 2021 Virginia governor's campaign, ticked through a number of areas he suggests Walz reinforces Harris, first as an authentic surrogate in the northern battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nAn enlisted Army veteran, \"not officer class,\" Walz is \"plainspoken, folksy in a way that will play well in the burbs and rural areas,\" Cambell said.\n\nHe's \"progressive, but not too far from center,\" he said, and will align with \"Harris on policy 90% of the time.\" Campbell called the selection \"rock steady.\"\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says Walz is a good pick for Harris' running mate\n\nBeshear said it was \"a true honor of a lifetime\" to be considered for Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate and that\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz was a good pick.\n\n\"He is a great friend,\" Beshear told reporters outside his office in the Kentucky Capitol on Tuesday afternoon. \"He'd be an amazing vice president. I am 100% onboard with doing everything I can to elect the Harris-Walz ticket this November.\"\n\nBeshear declined to comment on the process -- when he was interviewed for the job and if he heard from Harris or her team Tuesday morning.\n\nMan who owned rights to HarrisWalz.com says he's sold the domain; declined to name the buyer\n\nJeremy Green Eche, the trademark lawyer who purchased HarrisWalz.com for $8.99 in 2020, sold the domain - and a slate of others linked to Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris - on Tuesday for $15,000, he told The Associated Press shortly after the order was made.\n\nEche declined to say who bought the domains, but said they have \"no obvious connection to either campaign or anything political.\"\n\nHarris selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate Tuesday.\n\nEche bought the rights to the site and others in 2020 when the would-be vice president was in the midst of a primary campaign for president. When he learned Walz was the pick, Eche was particularly excited, both because the Harris supporter liked Walz best out of the men the vice president was considering, and because it meant someone paying his $15,000 asking price was more likely.\n\nNow that the site was sold, however, Eche says he feels glad but odd.\n\n\"I feel strange,\" he said, \"like it happened too soon.\"\n\nThe domains were sold on the website for Eche's start-up, Communer, a forum that allows people to buy and sell domains and trademarks online. Eche said the website will now draw up a domain transfer contract between himself and the buyer.\n\nGroup founded by Republican women opposed to Trump support Walz\n\nA group founded in June by current and former Republican women who oppose Donald Trump for president came out in favor of Walz as Harris' pick, in part for Walz's fiscal measures and policy accomplishments aimed at women.\n\n\"As Governor, he's cut taxes for the middle class while balancing the budget, supported paid family leave so new mothers can be home to care for their children, expanded access to pre-kindergarten, and make sure that no Minnesotan child goes hungry at school,\" a release from Women4U.S. states.\n\nThe group is a federal superPAC whose honorary advisers include former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, former New Hampshire Republican Chair Jennifer Horn and founding editor of The Weekly Standard, Bill Kristol.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi welcomes Walz to the race\n\nSpeaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi welcomed the Minnesotan to what she called the Harris-Walz \"freedom ticket.\"\n\n\"In the Congress, I saw firsthand Tim Walz's leadership, collaborative spirit and effectiveness in bringing people together and getting the job done,\" Pelosi said in a statement.\n\nThe former Democratic House speaker was pivotal in reshaping the presidential race as President Joe Biden stepped aside and she said the field of potential VP candidates \"demonstrated the strength and vitality of the next generation of Democratic leadership.\"\n\nWisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin: 'We're thrilled to see a fellow Midwesterner at the top of the ticket'\n\nIt didn't take Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin long to seize on Harris' selection of Walz as a fundraising tool for her competitive reelection campaign.\n\n\"We're thrilled to see a fellow Midwesterner at the top of the ticket,\" Baldwin said in a fundraising email sent late Tuesday morning.\n\nBaldwin, seeking a third term, is among several incumbent Democratic senators seeking reelection in states viewed as pivotal to the presidential campaign, and where an uptick in enthusiasm since Harris' takeover of Joe Biden's campaign has lifted the party's hope of holding the seat.\n\nBaldwin spoke at Harris' first campaign stop as a candidate last month, an upbeat rally in suburban Milwaukee.\n\n\"Wisconsin has emerged as the tipping point state that will determine who wins the White House and which party controls the Senate,\" Baldwin's email said.\n\nBiden carried Wisconsin in 2020 by fewer than 21,000 votes.\n\nVoto Latino co-founder says Walz as running mate will help energize Latino voters\n\nVoto Latino co-founder and President Maria Teresa Kumar said Walz's selection to the ticket would help energize Latino voters who want a more inclusive democracy.\n\nKumar said in a statement that Walz's \"strong record of defending democracy, protecting voting rights, and standing up for working families in Minnesota aligns perfectly with the values our organization and the Latino community hold dear.\"\n\nShe added that she knows the vice president and governor personally and knows they'll represent a powerful voice for \"progress, equality and opportunity for Latino communities and all Americans.\"\n\nSen. Mark Kelly urges supporters to contribute to the Harris-Walz ticket\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly said he and his wife, former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, will do everything they can to elect Harris and Walz after Kelly was passed over for the Democratic ticket.\n\nKelly sent an email to supporters urging them to contribute to the Harris-Walz ticket.\n\n\"Tim has years of experience representing Minnesota both in the House of Representatives, where he served with Gabby, and as Minnesota's governor,\" Kelly wrote. \"In that time, he has shown up time and time again for working families and I know he'll continue that work in the White House.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the head of GIFFORDS, a gun-control advocacy group founded by Kelly and Giffords, called Walz \"a strong gun safety champion.\"\n\n\"Gun violence is a top concern for Americans this election cycle and we know the Harris-Walz ticket is the only one that will stand up to the gun lobby and save lives,\" said GIFFORDS Executive Director Emma Brown, who managed Kelly's 2022 Senate campaign and was his deputy campaign manager when in his first race two years earlier 2020.\n\nVance blames Harris' policies for drug addiction deaths\n\nVance is aiming to tie what he portrays as Harris' failures along the U.S.-Mexico border to deaths from drug addiction.\n\nVance told several hundred supporters gathered in a South Philadelphia event space that, \"thanks to the policies of Kamala Harris, you've got children who've been orphaned\" when their parents die from drugs.\n\nSeveral Pennsylvanians shared personal stories of how addiction issues have impacted their families.\n\nAs he has over several speeches and interviews in recent weeks, Vance told his own story related to drug addition, noting that his mother has been drug-free for a decade but, as a child, he was \"desperately hoping and praying, Jesus, please let her wake up from this.\"\n\nU.S. government data undercuts the claim that people seeking asylum and other border crossers are responsible for drug trafficking. At a hearing last year, James Mandryck, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection deputy assistant commissioner, said 73% of fentanyl seizures at the border since the previous October were smuggling attempts carried out by U.S. citizens, with the rest being done by Mexican citizens.\n\nBarack and Michelle Obama say Harris 'has chosen an ideal partner'\n\n\"Governor Walz doesn't just have the experience to be vice president, he has the values and the integrity to make us proud,\" the former president and first lady said in a statement.\n\nThey said Walz enacted progressive priorities as Minnesota governor including paid family leave, abortion rights and gun safety measures.\n\n\"But Tim's signature is his ability to talk like a human being and treat everyone with decency and respect,\" the Obamas said.\n\nVance says he tried to get Walz on the phone\n\nThe Republican told reporters aboard his campaign plane Tuesday that he called Walz earlier in the day but \"I left him a voicemail, I didn't get him.\"\n\nIt's not clear if there will be a debate between Vance and Walz. Last week, Trump said he wouldn't take part in an ABC News debate that had been on the books for September because he made that agreement with Biden before the president exited the campaign.\n\nInstead, Trump said he would debate Harris on Sept. 4 on Fox News, but the vice president hasn't agreed to that time or network yet.\n\nPresident Joe Biden calls Harris-Walz ticket 'a powerful voice for working people' and middle class\n\nBiden called on Democrats and all Americans to rally behind them.\n\n\"They will be the strongest defenders of our personal freedoms and our democracy,\" Biden said in a social media post. \"And they will ensure that America continues to lead the world and play its role as the indispensable nation.\"\n\nBiden said choosing a running mate is a party nominee's first major decision and praised Harris' choice. He said he's known Walz for nearly two decades, praising his background as a teacher, football coach and National Guard soldier.\n\n\"Every generation of Americans faces a moment where they are asked to defend American democracy,\" Biden said. \"That moment is now.\"\n\nWhite House Senior Deputy Press Secretary Emilie Simons says Biden and Harris spoke on the phone Tuesday morning ahead of the official announcement that she selected Walz and that Biden spoke with Walz to congratulate him.\n\nVance says Walz pick as running mate 'highlights how radical' Harris is\n\nIn his first public comments since his general election foe was set, JD Vance on Tuesday called Walz a choice that \"highlights how radical Kamala Harris is.\"\n\nIn a gaggle with reporters aboard his campaign plane upon landing in Philadelphia, Vance said Walz \"is a person who listens to the Hamas wing\" of the Democratic Party and \"who wants to make the American people more reliant on garbage energy instead of good American energy.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nVance is speaking more to reporters in Philadelphia on Tuesday ahead of campaign events across Midwestern battleground states on Wednesday, in a path that somewhat mirrors Harris and Walz's planned trajectory.\n\nFormer colleagues on Capitol Hill appear thrilled with Walz as the VP pick\n\n\"Great choice,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\n\"Having served for years with Tim in the House of Representatives, I can say without reservation: there's no better person Vice President Harris could have picked to run and then govern alongside her,\" said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md.\n\nWalz \"has always put our country first,\" Van Hollen said, and he's excited to campaign for the Harris-Walz ticket for \"a brighter future for all Americans.\"\n\nRep. Mark Takano of California recalled how after Walz beat him during an internal House caucus vote to become the top Democrat on the Veterans Affairs Committee, his colleague \"immediately brought me into the fold because that's the type of leader he is: a collaborative bridge builder.\"\n\nAnd Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, who entered Congress with Walz in 2007, said he \"has always had this very straightforward, direct, open approach to things.\"\n\nWelch described Walz as \"one of these guys in the gym who wouldn't undo his tie\" because it would be faster for him to get back to work.\n\nPolling shows the appeal of Tim Walz's biography\n\nTim Walz's biography as a military veteran and former high school teacher - two broadly trusted professions - may also help him appeal to Americans as he campaigns with Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAbout 9 in 10 U.S. adults say they have a favorable opinion of military veterans, generally, according to an Ipsos poll conducted in 2024. About 8 in 10 say that about school teachers. Both measures are much higher than for government employees or elected officials. Republicans are slightly more likely than Democrats to have a positive view of veterans, while Democrats are a bit more likely to have a favorable opinion of those in a teaching career.\n\nGallup polling from 2022 found that high school teachers are generally held in high regard among Americans for their honesty and ethical standards. About half, 53%, gave them at least a high rating on ethics.\n\nAP VoteCast shows Tim Walz's electoral strengths and weakness in Minnesota\n\nDemocratic nominee Kamala Harris is hoping her VP choice, Tim Walz, will strengthen the Democratic ticket in Midwestern states and among working class voters.\n\nAP VoteCast shows that when Walz was elected Minnesota governor in 2022, he won young voters in the state. He also did well in Minnesota's union households, winning nearly 6 in 10 voters in that group. About half of Minnesota voters, 52%, had a favorable view of Walz, and about 4 in 10 had a negative one.\n\nAnd while Walz lost white voters without a college education in the state, he outperformed Democrats nationwide with this group. He also struggled among white men, a demographic Democrats have sought to win back from President Donald Trump, but did a little better among this group than Democrats nationwide.\n\nHowever, Walz lost among military veteran households in Minnesota in 2022, according to VoteCast.\n\nTim Walz will need to introduce himself to America\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz will need to introduce himself to the vast majority of Americans.\n\nAn ABC News/Ipsos survey conducted before Walz was selected as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, but after vetting began, showed that nearly 9 in 10 U.S. adults did not know enough to have an opinion about him. Among Americans with a view, opinions were split between positive and negative: 6% had a favorable view, and 7% had an unfavorable one.\n\nWalz's lack of a national profile as he joins Harris on the campaign trail extends to his own party. Nearly 9 in 10 Democrats also didn't know enough to have an opinion of Walz in the ABC News/Ipsos poll. One in 10 had a favorable view of him, and just 4% had a negative opinion. He was an unknown figure among most Democrats across the party: those older and younger were similarly likely to not know Walz, as well as white Democrats and non-white Democrats.\n\nFellow Minnesotan Sen. Amy Klobuchar says Walz is 'just unendingly optimistic and joyous'\n\nU.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar says Walz is someone who is \"just unendingly optimistic and joyous, and that is very, very important right now in our politics.\"\n\nThe fellow Minnesotan who served with Walz in Congress told The Associated Press \"he's blunt, but he's also positive\" in a way she believes will provide an upbeat message in contrast to the Trump-Vance Republican ticket.\n\n\"I always think of him in his plaid shirt because he was always making the point it's 'One Minnesota,'\" said Klobuchar, a Democrat. \"And I think that's a point you're going hear him talk about with our nation.\"\n\nShe said his background as a hunter and someone who fishes \"just brings a different perspective to the White House.\"\n\nSeveral black and white SUVs have left the Governor's residence in St. Paul\n\nThe SUVs left amid cheers from residents lined up on the sidewalk.\n\nHarris' running mate pick is good news for man who owns rights to HarrisWalz.com\n\nJeremy Green Eche was in the middle of getting his toddler dressed the moment news broke that Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris had selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate.\n\nAnd he was amped.\n\nEche was uniquely invested in Harris' pick. He currently owns the rights to HarrisWalz.com, a site he bought in 2020 -- along with a slate of other Harris sites -- when the would-be vice president was in the midst of a primary campaign for president. Four years and one vice presidential pick later, Eche is willing to sell the slate of Harris websites, including the one featuring Walz, for $15,000.\n\n\"I was constantly refreshing four different news sites on my phone,\" he told The Associated Press on Tuesday. \"I was very excited.\" He said he \"almost immediately\" began getting calls from both journalists and \"friends I hadn't heard from in a while.\"\n\nThis is not a new scenario for the 36-year-old trademark lawyer in Brooklyn, New York. Eche is a cyber squatter, someone who buys a domain with someone else's name or brand in it for very little money, hoping to sell it to that person or brand for a large profit in the subsequent months or years. In 2011, when it looked likely that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would be the Democratic nominee in 2016, then Jeremy Peter Green - he took his wife's last name - purchased ClintonKaine.com.\n\nAfter the former secretary of state picked Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, the squatter offered it to the campaign for a hefty return. They declined, so he sold it for $15,000 to a digital marketing company that turned out to be the Trump campaign. The website pushed anti-Clinton news with \"Paid for by Donald J. Trump for President, Inc\" emblazoned at the bottom.\n\nEche supported Clinton in 2016 and supports Harris today. The prospect of something like that happening again doesn't give Eche pause, however.\n\n\"The Harris campaign has hundreds of millions of dollars, so if they don't buy their own domain, that is kind of on them,\" he said Monday. But he isn't convinced they will buy the domain.\n\n\"I don't want to be too confident that somebody will reach out,\" he said after Walz was selected. \"I would say there's a 75% chance that one of the campaigns, or a PAC, will buy it from me.\"\n\nWalz says he's 'all in'\n\nIn a Tuesday morning post on X, Walz said joining the ticket with Harris is \"the honor of a lifetime.\"\n\nHis profile details on X are now \"Running to win this thing with @kamalaharris.\"\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro on Walz\n\nShapiro called Walz \"an exceptionally strong addition to the ticket\" who'll help Harris become the 47th president.\n\nShapiro, who met with Harris on Sunday about the job, said he was grateful to talk about \"her vision for the role and the campaign ahead.\"\n\n\"As I've said repeatedly over the past several weeks, the running mate decision was a deeply personal decision for the vice president - and it was also a deeply personal decision for me. Pennsylvanians elected me to a four-year term as their governor, and my work here is far from finished - there is a lot more stuff I want to get done for the good people of this commonwealth,\" Shapiro said in a statement.\n\nHe said he considers Walz a good friend and pledged to travel the state over the next three months to help Democrats defeat former President Donald Trump \"and build a better future for our country.\"\n\n\"Vice President Kamala Harris has my enthusiastic support - and I know that Governor Tim Walz is an exceptionally strong addition to the ticket who will help Kamala move our country forward,\" Shapiro said.\n\nAt the Governor's mansion, a Minnesota resident says why he likes Walz\n\nDavid Ivory, 46, stood outside the Governor's mansion with his two children. Ivory found out Walz was selected after his wife texted him \"OMG\" from work.\n\nHe and his kids immediately hopped on their bikes and rode to the Governor's residence in St. Paul.\n\nIvory and his family are longtime admirers of Walz for his liberal record and amiable political persona.\n\n\"He's just down to earth. He gets it. He can talk to anybody,\" Ivory said. \"He doesn't seem like he's above anybody. He was a teacher. He understands kids, which is very important.\"\n\nHarris says her new running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has 'delivered for working families'\n\n\"It's great to have him on the team,\" Harris said.\n\nHarris posted on X that she was proud to announce she asked Walz to join her on the 2024 ticket.\n\nVoter Coalition Pushes Issue-Based Outreach Strategy to Increase Registration, Shifting from Top of Ticket Politics\n\nState Voices launched a $3 million nationwide campaign Tuesday to encourage voters of color to vote based on the issues that affect their day-to-day lives, like grocery price spikes or growing rent and mortgage payments.\n\nUnder the Vote for Something campaign, the coalition aims to register 800,000 voters, make more than 250 million voter contacts, and encourage 100,000 people to make a plan to vote on or ahead of the 2024 election for themselves and others.\n\nThey've registered more than 400,000 voters so far.\n\nState Voices, like many voting rights advocates, hopes for messaging that transcends the top of the ticket -- a looming match between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\"Whatever the issue is that matters to you, vote for something. Get out this November and bring a friend and a family member with you,\" said Mishara Davis, the group's director of issue and electoral organizing.\n\nThe key has been reaching voters who may be tired of the political space altogether or who are eligible to vote but aren't registered and therefore may not receive voting information -- especially in presidential swing states, Georgia, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, which are primary areas under the campaign.\n\nThis comes as Harris, who is in Pennsylvania this week, has chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, sources say. The pair will continue the campaign tour to Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada starting Wednesday.\n\nEnvironmental group cheers selection of Walz as the Democratic vice presidential candidate\n\nManish Bapna, president and CEO of the NRDC Action Fund, the political arm of the Natural Resources Defense Council, called Harris and Walz \"the winning ticket on climate. The Harris-Walz administration will be ready, on day one, to build on the strongest climate action ever and lead by example in the global fight against the existential challenge of our time.''\n\nWalz has made Minnesota a national climate leader, Bapna said. Under his leadership, the state committed to 100% clean energy by 2040, and Minnesota was the first Midwestern state to adopt California's strict tailpipe emissions standards. Walz also signed a bill last year directing $240 million to replace lead service water lines statewide.\n\n\"The stakes in this election couldn't be higher nor the choice more clear. Trump would bow to billionaire oil and gas donors, slam climate progress into reverse and leave our kids to pay the price. Harris is a proven climate and justice leader with two decades of public service on the front lines of needed progress and change. She's shown us what leadership looks like, and she's earned the chance to lead,\" Bapna said.\n\nThe National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund praises Walz's selection\n\n\"The National LGBTQ Action Fund expected a strategic and bold choice as a strong addition to the ticket as a Vice-Presidential candidate,\" Sayre E. Reece, vice president of the National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, said Tuesday in a statement. \"In Governor Walz we have gotten both.\"\n\nReece continued: \"Governor Walz has been a steadfast ally and advocate for the LGBTQ community, including support for trans affirming care, bodily autonomy and reproductive freedom and gun control. As Governor, Walz signed a ban on so-called 'conversion therapy' into law, ending the harmful and cruel practice that has cost LGBTQ people their dignity and their lives. Under Walz's leadership, Minnesota is both a 'trans sanctuary' and immigration sanctuary state.\"\n\nThe National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund describes itself as lobbying for legislation and ballot initiatives that \"achieve justice\" for LGBTQ people.\n\nAt Walz's residence in Minnesota\n\nA growing crowd of residents and news reporters gathered outside Walz's residence in St. Paul, Minnesota, on Tuesday morning.\n\nBlack and white SUVs periodically pulled into the driveway as onlookers waited to catch a glimpse of Walz leaving the 20-room governor's mansion near the Mississippi River.\n\nNo immediate comment from Vance on Harris picking Walz as her running mate\n\nBoarding his campaign plane Tuesday morning in Cincinnati for a swing through battleground states this week, Ohio Sen. JD Vance did not answer shouted questions about Harris picking Walz as her running mate.\n\nOn Tuesday, Vance was heading to Pennsylvania, where Harris planned to debut with her new running mate later in the day.\n\nTrump attacks Walz in a fundraising email\n\nDonald Trump sent a fundraising email calling Walz \"Dangerously Liberal\" and saying he would \"unleash HELL ON EARTH.\"\n\nMoments after Harris' VP pick became public, the former president and Republican nominee said Walz would be the worst vice president in history, claiming the Minnesota governor would \"light TRILLIONS of dollars on fire\" and open U.S. borders to criminals.\n\n\"HE'S THAT BAD,\" the email says.\n\nThe selection process that led Harris to pick Walz as her running mate\n\nA team of lawyers and political operatives led by former attorney general Eric Holder pored over documents and conducted interviews with potential vice presidential selections.\n\nAnd Harris herself met with her three finalists on Sunday. She mulled the decision over Monday with top aides at the vice president's residence in Washington and finalized it Tuesday morning.\n\nWalz emerged as the choice.\n\nA Minnesota Democratic strategist praises Walz's ability to connect with voters\n\nMinnesota Democratic strategist Abu Amara says Walz will be a good surrogate for Harris across the upper Midwest, because he represented a rural U.S. House district but won statewide in a state with large metropolitan and suburban areas.\n\n\"He's not trying to speak in poetry. He speaks in practicality,\" Amara said. \"That's a level of accessibility for so many voters.\"\n\n\"He has the ability to connect with rural, suburban and urban voters,\" he said.\n\nSome Republicans are already reacting to the selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as Harris' VP pick\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis called it the \"most left-wing ticket in American history\" and accused Walz of not doing enough to protect Minnesota during the 2020 protests over the killing of George Floyd.\n\nHe said \"Walz sat by and let Minneapolis burn.\"\n\nTropical Storm Debby continues to upend Harris' travel plans this week\n\nThe campaign had already pulled down a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, because of the weather.\n\nBut the Democratic presidential nominee will now no longer travel to Raleigh, North Carolina, either, according to the campaign. She was set to travel to Raleigh on Thursday.\n\nHarris is launching a tour of battleground states on Tuesday evening, starting in Philadelphia.\n\nHarris picks Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as running mate, AP sources say\n\nVice President Kamala Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday. That's according to three people who spoke to The Associated Press.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she's turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families. The people were not authorized to speak publicly about the choice and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.\n\n-- Seung Min Kim, Zeke Miller and Colleen Long\n\nSources say Harris has decided on a running mate\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has decided on a running mate and an announcement is expected in the coming hours before the two appear together at a Philadelphia rally, according to three people familiar with her decision.\n\nIn recent days, she has zeroed in on a trio of potential finalists: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. It wasn't clear yet who she picked.\n\nThe people were familiar with her plans but spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that had not been publicly announced.\n\nHarris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\n-- Seung Min Kim, Zeke Miller and Colleen Long\n\nHarris formally secures the Democratic presidential nomination\n\nVice President Kamala Harris formally secured the Democratic presidential nomination late Monday -- becoming the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket.\n\nHarris' nomination became official after a five-day round of online balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates ended Monday night, with the party saying in a statement released just before midnight that 99% of delegates casting ballots had done so for Harris. It said it would next formally certify the vote before holding a celebratory roll call at the party's convention later this month in Chicago.\n\nHarris' coronation as her party's standard-bearer caps a tumultuous and frenetic period for Democrats prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous June debate performance.\n\nAs soon as Biden abruptly ended his candidacy, Harris and her team worked rapidly to secure backing from the 1,976 party delegates needed to clinch the nomination in a formal roll call vote. She reached that marker at warp speed, with an Associated Press survey of delegates nationwide showing she locked down the necessary commitments a mere 32 hours after Biden's announcement.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Tim Walz will be her running mate in the 2024 presidential election increased the spread of false claims about the Midwestern Democrat, some of which appeared on social media even before Harris made her pick public.\n\nCLAIM: Walz said on CNN that he wants to invest in a \"ladder factory\" to help people scale the wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and illegally enter the U.S.\n\nTHE FACTS: That's false. Posts are misrepresenting a comment Walz made on an episode of CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360\" last week. In the full segment, the Democrat criticizes former President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall on the southern border by joking about the hypothetical investment. He then gives multiple other examples of how to address illegal crossings into the U.S. through Mexico.\n\nAmid Harris' Tuesday announcement, social media users used a clip from the segment to make it seem as though the Minnesota governor was advocating for illegal immigration.\n\n\"He talks about this wall, I always say, 'let me know how high it is, if it's 25 feet then I'll invest in a 30-foot-ladder factory,'\" Walz says, referencing Trump. \"That's not how you stop this.\"\n\nOne X post that shared the clip reads: \"FLASHBACK: Kamala's VP pick, Tim Walz, says he should invest in a 'ladder factory' to help illegal aliens climb the border wall.\"\n\nBut Walz was not offering to help people enter the U.S. without authorization. He was actually discussing how to prevent this from happening.\n\nIn the full segment, after making the investment quip, Walz gives alternative ideas for how to handle illegal crossings on the southern border. Arrests for such crossings reached a record high in December, but dropped to a new low for the Biden administration at the end of July following a temporary ban on asylum.\n\n\"You stop this using electronics, you stop it using more border control agents and you stop it by having a legal system that allows for that tradition of allowing folks to come here just like my relatives did,\" Walz says near the end of the segment. \"To come here, be able to work and establish the American dream.\"\n\nHe also spoke in support of a bipartisan border security package intended to cut back on illegal crossings that the Senate voted down in February.\n\n-- Associated Press writer Melissa Goldin contributed this report.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: Walz changed the Minnesota flag so that it resembles the Somali flag.\n\nTHE FACTS: Minnesota did unfurl a new state flag and accompanying seal in May, but the changes were made to replace an old design that Native Americans said reminded them of painful memories of conquest and displacement. The State Emblems Redesign Commission was established during the 2023 legislative session to oversee the development of a new design.\n\nChanges were made to eliminate an old state seal that featured the image of a Native American riding off into the sunset while a white settler plowed his field with a rifle at the ready. The seal was a key feature of the old flag.\n\nThe commission included public officials, design experts and members of tribal and other communities of color. Its purpose statement dictated that the designs \"must accurately and respectfully reflect Minnesota's shared history, resources, and diverse cultural communities. Symbols, emblems, or likenesses that represent only a single community or person, regardless of whether real or stylized, may not be included in a design.\"\n\nThe public submitted more than 2,600 proposals and the commission picked one from Andrew Prekker, 25, of Luverne, as the basis for the flag.\n\nPrekker said Walz had nothing to do with the creation of the flag, and Somalia had nothing to do with the flag design. Minnesota is home to the largest Somali population in the U.S. and is home to U.S. Rep. Ilhan Oman, who was born in Somalia and is a member of an informal group of progressive Democratic House members known as The Squad.\n\n\"The inspiration behind my flag were three main concepts inspired by Minnesota's history and culture: The North Star, the Minnesota shape, and three stripes representing different facets of Minnesotan identity,\" he wrote in an email.\n\nPrekker's original design had the white star on the blue background with white, green and light blue stripes stretching over the rest of the flag. The flag was compared online with flags from states in Somalia that have green, white and blue stripes and a star. The stripes were dropped by the commission in the final design.\n\nThe final version of the flag features a dark blue shape resembling Minnesota with a white, eight-pointed star on it. The right side is light blue and is meant to symbolize the state's abundant waters that led to it being known as the Land of 10,000 Lakes.\n\nThe Somali flag has a five-point star on a light blue background. \"There is no connection to Somalia or any other country, and in complete honesty I didn't even know Somalia existed before the whole flag debacle. Any similarities people want to see are a coincidence. It is a Minnesotan flag, and that is what I designed it for,\" Prekker said."],"source":{"uri":["beaumontenterprise.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Beaumont Enterprise"]},"authors":[{"uri":["associated_press@beaumontenterprise.com"],"name":["Associated Press"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[true]}],"image":["https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/41/30/57/25529280/3/rawImage.jpg"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[-0.0667],"wgt":[460679738],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8262540908"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-06"],"time":["22:34:10"],"dateTime":["2024-08-06T22:34:10Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-06T22:31:07Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.fox41yakima.com/the-latest-harris-and-walz-debut-at-philadelphia-rally/"],"title":["The Latest: Harris and Walz debut at Philadelphia rally | Fox 11 Tri Cities Fox 41 Yakima"],"body":["Vice President Kamala Harris has chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, looking to strengthen the Democratic ticket in Midwestern states.\n\nShe introduced Walz at a rally Tuesday evening in Philadelphia.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a deadline last week. She officially claimed the nomination Monday night when the DNC released final results.\n\nFollow the AP's Election-2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nHarris and Walz take the stage\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has made her first appearance with her newly chosen running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nHarris and Walz have taken the stage together at a packed rally in Philadelphia. The pair ignited sustained cheers as they appeared before thousands at Temple University's Liacouras Center.\n\nWalz, the 60-year-old governor and former U.S. House member from rural south central Minnesota, put his hands together and bowed to the crowd. He stood alongside Harris as she waved to the audience and put her hand over her heart, wrapping the other around Walz.\n\nAccording to excerpts provided by the campaign, Walz plans to use his speech to say that Minnesota values are American values.\n\nBiden learned about Walz from Harris, not the news\n\n\"He heard it first from the vice president,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at her regular briefing. She said she couldn't \"pinpoint\" exactly where the president was when Harris called on Tuesday morning, but that he was somewhere in the executive mansion.\n\n\"She called him to let him know of her pick,\" Jean-Pierre said.\n\nHarris had sought Biden's advice during her search for a running mate, but Jean-Pierre left it there and declined to get into any specifics.\n\nBiden also spoke with Walz and congratulated him on his selection.\n\nPhiladelphia mayor calls for unity among Democrats\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker, who advocated fiercely but unsuccessfully for her state's governor, Josh Shapiro, to be Harris' running mate now says, \"Our Democratic nominee has spoken and that's it. Period. End of story.\"\n\nAt a rally in her city on Tuesday, Parker urged Pennsylvania Democrats to rally behind Harris' choice. Noting that Republicans and detractors would attempt to divide Democrats over the pick Parker says that the party can't let them.\n\nParker made headlines last week for posting a video praising Harris and Shapiro, which some thought suggested Harris had already picked Shapiro as her running mate. Instead, Harris chose Walz and the pair will appear together for the first time at the Philadelphia rally.\n\nThe last politician to face off against Tim Walz has some advice for JD Vance\n\nDr. Scott Jensen, a physician and former Republican Minnesota state senator, was the last political candidate to run against Walz in a general election but lost by nearly 8 points. Jensen says Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance should be prepared for Walz's fast-talking debate style. He also thinks Walz's appeal in rural areas has been overstated.\n\n\"Tim Walz can talk around a topic extremely effectively. He will give people the impression that he is the candidate of the common, everyday person,\" Jensen said. \"But if you look at the results of the 2022 election, Tim Walz really won the election because of the Twin Cities, Duluth and Rochester.\"\n\nHe also pointed out that in the 2022 governor's race, Walz lost many of the counties in the district he previously represented in Congress.\n\n\"Tim Walz lost the district in which the people who knew him best were offered the opportunity to make a decision about his candidacy,\" Jensen said. \"I think that's telling.\"\n\nTrump will sit for an interview with Elon Musk\n\nTrump says that he will do an interview with billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk next week. Musk endorsed the Republican for president after Trump survived an assassination attempt.\n\n\"ON MONDAY NIGHT I'LL BE DOING A MAJOR INTERVIEW WITH ELON MUSK -- Details to follow!\" Trump posted on his social media network.\n\nHis campaign did not immediately have more details to share.\n\nTrump, a longtime opponent of electric cars, said over the weekend at his rally in Atlanta that he favors electric cars \"for a small slice\" of the population, saying, \"I have to be, you know, because Elon endorsed me very strongly.\" He added: \"So I have no choice.\"\n\nExpect Walz to extol Harris during his first running mate appearance\n\nAhead of a rally in Philadelphia, the Harris campaign has released experts of Walz's prepared remarks where he'll introduce himself to the nation, highlight his support for Harris and emphasize stopping Trump at the ballot.\n\nWalz will say that the vice president \"has fought on the side of the American people\" and \"brings joy to everything she does.\"\n\n\"Minnesota's strength comes from our values -- our commitment to working together, to seeing past our differences, to lending a helping hand,\" Walz plans to tell the rally. \"Donald Trump -- he sees the world differently. He doesn't know the first thing about service -- because he's too busy serving himself.\"\n\nThe phone call that sealed the deal\n\nWearing khakis and a camouflage baseball cap, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz accepted a phone call from Vice President Kamala Harris. The Harris campaign has posted a video of the call on social media.\n\n\"Hi, this is Tim,\" Walz said into his phone.\n\n\"It's Kamala Harris. Good morning, governor,\" the Democratic nominee said with a big smile. \"Listen, I want you to do this with me. Let's do this together. Would you be my running mate?\"\n\n\"I would be honored, madame vice president,\" Walz said.\n\nThe two exchanged pleasantries over the roughly minute-long video and Harris ended the call with an, \"All right, buddy. I'll see you soon. Take care.\"\n\nThe campaign said it has raised more than $10 million from \"grassroots supporters alone\" since Walz became her running mate.\n\nVoter Voices: 'I was open for whoever she picked'\n\nMarnie Fowler, a 44-year-old Philadelphia who works in concert touring, wore a blue T-shirt she recently purchased online that said: \"Childless Cat Lady,\" a reference to remarks by GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance. Farlow said she wanted Walz all along. \"He's America's dad,\" Farlow said. \"Everything he's done in Minnesota aligns with my values.\"\n\nCheryl Pitts, a 77-year-old retired state worker from Sicklerville, New Jersey, said she was \"a little bit\" disappointed that Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro wasn't picked, \"but it won't stop us from voting; it didn't diminish my excitement.\" She called Walz \"a regular kind of guy that I can believe what he says.\"\n\nBernie Strain, 66, wore a shirt he made himself for the rally that said: \"OLD WHITE MEN FOR HARRIS & FREEDOM.\" Strain said he'd met Shapiro through politics but was ready to support whoever Harris selected. \"I was open for whoever she picked,\" he said. \"I was going to support them with both feet.\"\n\nA Republican strategist actually praising Harris' VP pick\n\nMark Campbell is a rare Republican who's publicly praising Harris' choice of Walz, calling it \"a home run.\"\n\nCampbell, a veteran GOP strategist who managed Glenn Youngkin's winning 2021 Virginia governor's campaign, ticked through a number of areas he suggests Walz reinforces Harris, first as an authentic surrogate in the northern battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nAn enlisted Army veteran, \"not officer class,\" Walz is \"plainspoken, folksy in a way that will play well in the burbs and rural areas,\" Cambell said.\n\nHe's \"progressive, but not too far from center,\" he said, and will align with \"Harris on policy 90% of the time.\" Campbell called the selection \"rock steady.\"\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says Walz is a good pick for Harris' running mate\n\nBeshear said it was \"a true honor of a lifetime\" to be considered for Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate and that\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz was a good pick.\n\n\"He is a great friend,\" Beshear told reporters outside his office in the Kentucky Capitol on Tuesday afternoon. \"He'd be an amazing vice president. I am 100% onboard with doing everything I can to elect the Harris-Walz ticket this November.\"\n\nBeshear declined to comment on the process -- when he was interviewed for the job and if he heard from Harris or her team Tuesday morning.\n\nMan who owned rights to HarrisWalz.com says he's sold the domain; declined to name the buyer\n\nJeremy Green Eche, the trademark lawyer who purchased HarrisWalz.com for $8.99 in 2020, sold the domain - and a slate of others linked to Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris - on Tuesday for $15,000, he told The Associated Press shortly after the order was made.\n\nEche declined to say who bought the domains, but said they have \"no obvious connection to either campaign or anything political.\"\n\nHarris selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate Tuesday.\n\nEche bought the rights to the site and others in 2020 when the would-be vice president was in the midst of a primary campaign for president. When he learned Walz was the pick, Eche was particularly excited, both because the Harris supporter liked Walz best out of the men the vice president was considering, and because it meant someone paying his $15,000 asking price was more likely.\n\nNow that the site was sold, however, Eche says he feels glad but odd.\n\n\"I feel strange,\" he said, \"like it happened too soon.\"\n\nThe domains were sold on the website for Eche's start-up, Communer, a forum that allows people to buy and sell domains and trademarks online. Eche said the website will now draw up a domain transfer contract between himself and the buyer.\n\nGroup founded by Republican women opposed to Trump support Walz\n\nA group founded in June by current and former Republican women who oppose Donald Trump for president came out in favor of Walz as Harris' pick, in part for Walz's fiscal measures and policy accomplishments aimed at women.\n\n\"As Governor, he's cut taxes for the middle class while balancing the budget, supported paid family leave so new mothers can be home to care for their children, expanded access to pre-kindergarten, and make sure that no Minnesotan child goes hungry at school,\" a release from Women4U.S. states.\n\nThe group is a federal superPAC whose honorary advisers include former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, former New Hampshire Republican Chair Jennifer Horn and founding editor of The Weekly Standard, Bill Kristol.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi welcomes Walz to the race\n\nSpeaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi welcomed the Minnesotan to what she called the Harris-Walz \"freedom ticket.\"\n\n\"In the Congress, I saw firsthand Tim Walz's leadership, collaborative spirit and effectiveness in bringing people together and getting the job done,\" Pelosi said in a statement.\n\nThe former Democratic House speaker was pivotal in reshaping the presidential race as President Joe Biden stepped aside and she said the field of potential VP candidates \"demonstrated the strength and vitality of the next generation of Democratic leadership.\"\n\nWisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin: 'We're thrilled to see a fellow Midwesterner at the top of the ticket'\n\nIt didn't take Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin long to seize on Harris' selection of Walz as a fundraising tool for her competitive reelection campaign.\n\n\"We're thrilled to see a fellow Midwesterner at the top of the ticket,\" Baldwin said in a fundraising email sent late Tuesday morning.\n\nBaldwin, seeking a third term, is among several incumbent Democratic senators seeking reelection in states viewed as pivotal to the presidential campaign, and where an uptick in enthusiasm since Harris' takeover of Joe Biden's campaign has lifted the party's hope of holding the seat.\n\nBaldwin spoke at Harris' first campaign stop as a candidate last month, an upbeat rally in suburban Milwaukee.\n\n\"Wisconsin has emerged as the tipping point state that will determine who wins the White House and which party controls the Senate,\" Baldwin's email said.\n\nBiden carried Wisconsin in 2020 by fewer than 21,000 votes.\n\nVoto Latino co-founder says Walz as running mate will help energize Latino voters\n\nVoto Latino co-founder and President Maria Teresa Kumar said Walz's selection to the ticket would help energize Latino voters who want a more inclusive democracy.\n\nKumar said in a statement that Walz's \"strong record of defending democracy, protecting voting rights, and standing up for working families in Minnesota aligns perfectly with the values our organization and the Latino community hold dear.\"\n\nShe added that she knows the vice president and governor personally and knows they'll represent a powerful voice for \"progress, equality and opportunity for Latino communities and all Americans.\"\n\nSen. Mark Kelly urges supporters to contribute to the Harris-Walz ticket\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly said he and his wife, former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, will do everything they can to elect Harris and Walz after Kelly was passed over for the Democratic ticket.\n\nKelly sent an email to supporters urging them to contribute to the Harris-Walz ticket.\n\n\"Tim has years of experience representing Minnesota both in the House of Representatives, where he served with Gabby, and as Minnesota's governor,\" Kelly wrote. \"In that time, he has shown up time and time again for working families and I know he'll continue that work in the White House.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the head of GIFFORDS, a gun-control advocacy group founded by Kelly and Giffords, called Walz \"a strong gun safety champion.\"\n\n\"Gun violence is a top concern for Americans this election cycle and we know the Harris-Walz ticket is the only one that will stand up to the gun lobby and save lives,\" said GIFFORDS Executive Director Emma Brown, who managed Kelly's 2022 Senate campaign and was his deputy campaign manager when in his first race two years earlier 2020.\n\nVance blames Harris' policies for drug addiction deaths\n\nVance is aiming to tie what he portrays as Harris' failures along the U.S.-Mexico border to deaths from drug addiction.\n\nVance told several hundred supporters gathered in a South Philadelphia event space that, \"thanks to the policies of Kamala Harris, you've got children who've been orphaned\" when their parents die from drugs.\n\nSeveral Pennsylvanians shared personal stories of how addiction issues have impacted their families.\n\nAs he has over several speeches and interviews in recent weeks, Vance told his own story related to drug addition, noting that his mother has been drug-free for a decade but, as a child, he was \"desperately hoping and praying, Jesus, please let her wake up from this.\"\n\nU.S. government data undercuts the claim that people seeking asylum and other border crossers are responsible for drug trafficking. At a hearing last year, James Mandryck, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection deputy assistant commissioner, said 73% of fentanyl seizures at the border since the previous October were smuggling attempts carried out by U.S. citizens, with the rest being done by Mexican citizens.\n\nBarack and Michelle Obama say Harris 'has chosen an ideal partner'\n\n\"Governor Walz doesn't just have the experience to be vice president, he has the values and the integrity to make us proud,\" the former president and first lady said in a statement.\n\nThey said Walz enacted progressive priorities as Minnesota governor including paid family leave, abortion rights and gun safety measures.\n\n\"But Tim's signature is his ability to talk like a human being and treat everyone with decency and respect,\" the Obamas said.\n\nVance says he tried to get Walz on the phone\n\nThe Republican told reporters aboard his campaign plane Tuesday that he called Walz earlier in the day but \"I left him a voicemail, I didn't get him.\"\n\nIt's not clear if there will be a debate between Vance and Walz. Last week, Trump said he wouldn't take part in an ABC News debate that had been on the books for September because he made that agreement with Biden before the president exited the campaign.\n\nInstead, Trump said he would debate Harris on Sept. 4 on Fox News, but the vice president hasn't agreed to that time or network yet.\n\nPresident Joe Biden calls Harris-Walz ticket 'a powerful voice for working people' and middle class\n\nBiden called on Democrats and all Americans to rally behind them.\n\n\"They will be the strongest defenders of our personal freedoms and our democracy,\" Biden said in a social media post. \"And they will ensure that America continues to lead the world and play its role as the indispensable nation.\"\n\nBiden said choosing a running mate is a party nominee's first major decision and praised Harris' choice. He said he's known Walz for nearly two decades, praising his background as a teacher, football coach and National Guard soldier.\n\n\"Every generation of Americans faces a moment where they are asked to defend American democracy,\" Biden said. \"That moment is now.\"\n\nWhite House Senior Deputy Press Secretary Emilie Simons says Biden and Harris spoke on the phone Tuesday morning ahead of the official announcement that she selected Walz and that Biden spoke with Walz to congratulate him.\n\nVance says Walz pick as running mate 'highlights how radical' Harris is\n\nIn his first public comments since his general election foe was set, JD Vance on Tuesday called Walz a choice that \"highlights how radical Kamala Harris is.\"\n\nIn a gaggle with reporters aboard his campaign plane upon landing in Philadelphia, Vance said Walz \"is a person who listens to the Hamas wing\" of the Democratic Party and \"who wants to make the American people more reliant on garbage energy instead of good American energy.\"\n\nVance is speaking more to reporters in Philadelphia on Tuesday ahead of campaign events across Midwestern battleground states on Wednesday, in a path that somewhat mirrors Harris and Walz's planned trajectory.\n\nFormer colleagues on Capitol Hill appear thrilled with Walz as the VP pick\n\n\"Great choice,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\n\"Having served for years with Tim in the House of Representatives, I can say without reservation: there's no better person Vice President Harris could have picked to run and then govern alongside her,\" said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md.\n\nWalz \"has always put our country first,\" Van Hollen said, and he's excited to campaign for the Harris-Walz ticket for \"a brighter future for all Americans.\"\n\nRep. Mark Takano of California recalled how after Walz beat him during an internal House caucus vote to become the top Democrat on the Veterans Affairs Committee, his colleague \"immediately brought me into the fold because that's the type of leader he is: a collaborative bridge builder.\"\n\nAnd Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, who entered Congress with Walz in 2007, said he \"has always had this very straightforward, direct, open approach to things.\"\n\nWelch described Walz as \"one of these guys in the gym who wouldn't undo his tie\" because it would be faster for him to get back to work.\n\nPolling shows the appeal of Tim Walz's biography\n\nTim Walz's biography as a military veteran and former high school teacher - two broadly trusted professions - may also help him appeal to Americans as he campaigns with Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAbout 9 in 10 U.S. adults say they have a favorable opinion of military veterans, generally, according to an Ipsos poll conducted in 2024. About 8 in 10 say that about school teachers. Both measures are much higher than for government employees or elected officials. Republicans are slightly more likely than Democrats to have a positive view of veterans, while Democrats are a bit more likely to have a favorable opinion of those in a teaching career.\n\nGallup polling from 2022 found that high school teachers are generally held in high regard among Americans for their honesty and ethical standards. About half, 53%, gave them at least a high rating on ethics.\n\nAP VoteCast shows Tim Walz's electoral strengths and weakness in Minnesota\n\nDemocratic nominee Kamala Harris is hoping her VP choice, Tim Walz, will strengthen the Democratic ticket in Midwestern states and among working class voters.\n\nAP VoteCast shows that when Walz was elected Minnesota governor in 2022, he won young voters in the state. He also did well in Minnesota's union households, winning nearly 6 in 10 voters in that group. About half of Minnesota voters, 52%, had a favorable view of Walz, and about 4 in 10 had a negative one.\n\nAnd while Walz lost white voters without a college education in the state, he outperformed Democrats nationwide with this group. He also struggled among white men, a demographic Democrats have sought to win back from President Donald Trump, but did a little better among this group than Democrats nationwide.\n\nHowever, Walz lost among military veteran households in Minnesota in 2022, according to VoteCast.\n\nTim Walz will need to introduce himself to America\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz will need to introduce himself to the vast majority of Americans.\n\nAn ABC News/Ipsos survey conducted before Walz was selected as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, but after vetting began, showed that nearly 9 in 10 U.S. adults did not know enough to have an opinion about him. Among Americans with a view, opinions were split between positive and negative: 6% had a favorable view, and 7% had an unfavorable one.\n\nWalz's lack of a national profile as he joins Harris on the campaign trail extends to his own party. Nearly 9 in 10 Democrats also didn't know enough to have an opinion of Walz in the ABC News/Ipsos poll. One in 10 had a favorable view of him, and just 4% had a negative opinion. He was an unknown figure among most Democrats across the party: those older and younger were similarly likely to not know Walz, as well as white Democrats and non-white Democrats.\n\nFellow Minnesotan Sen. Amy Klobuchar says Walz is 'just unendingly optimistic and joyous'\n\nU.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar says Walz is someone who is \"just unendingly optimistic and joyous, and that is very, very important right now in our politics.\"\n\nThe fellow Minnesotan who served with Walz in Congress told The Associated Press \"he's blunt, but he's also positive\" in a way she believes will provide an upbeat message in contrast to the Trump-Vance Republican ticket.\n\n\"I always think of him in his plaid shirt because he was always making the point it's 'One Minnesota,'\" said Klobuchar, a Democrat. \"And I think that's a point you're going hear him talk about with our nation.\"\n\nShe said his background as a hunter and someone who fishes \"just brings a different perspective to the White House.\"\n\nSeveral black and white SUVs have left the Governor's residence in St. Paul\n\nThe SUVs left amid cheers from residents lined up on the sidewalk.\n\nHarris' running mate pick is good news for man who owns rights to HarrisWalz.com\n\nJeremy Green Eche was in the middle of getting his toddler dressed the moment news broke that Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris had selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate.\n\nAnd he was amped.\n\nEche was uniquely invested in Harris' pick. He currently owns the rights to HarrisWalz.com, a site he bought in 2020 -- along with a slate of other Harris sites -- when the would-be vice president was in the midst of a primary campaign for president. Four years and one vice presidential pick later, Eche is willing to sell the slate of Harris websites, including the one featuring Walz, for $15,000.\n\n\"I was constantly refreshing four different news sites on my phone,\" he told The Associated Press on Tuesday. \"I was very excited.\" He said he \"almost immediately\" began getting calls from both journalists and \"friends I hadn't heard from in a while.\"\n\nThis is not a new scenario for the 36-year-old trademark lawyer in Brooklyn, New York. Eche is a cyber squatter, someone who buys a domain with someone else's name or brand in it for very little money, hoping to sell it to that person or brand for a large profit in the subsequent months or years. In 2011, when it looked likely that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would be the Democratic nominee in 2016, then Jeremy Peter Green - he took his wife's last name - purchased ClintonKaine.com.\n\nAfter the former secretary of state picked Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, the squatter offered it to the campaign for a hefty return. They declined, so he sold it for $15,000 to a digital marketing company that turned out to be the Trump campaign. The website pushed anti-Clinton news with \"Paid for by Donald J. Trump for President, Inc\" emblazoned at the bottom.\n\nEche supported Clinton in 2016 and supports Harris today. The prospect of something like that happening again doesn't give Eche pause, however.\n\n\"The Harris campaign has hundreds of millions of dollars, so if they don't buy their own domain, that is kind of on them,\" he said Monday. But he isn't convinced they will buy the domain.\n\n\"I don't want to be too confident that somebody will reach out,\" he said after Walz was selected. \"I would say there's a 75% chance that one of the campaigns, or a PAC, will buy it from me.\"\n\nWalz says he's 'all in'\n\nIn a Tuesday morning post on X, Walz said joining the ticket with Harris is \"the honor of a lifetime.\"\n\nHis profile details on X are now \"Running to win this thing with @kamalaharris.\"\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro on Walz\n\nShapiro called Walz \"an exceptionally strong addition to the ticket\" who'll help Harris become the 47th president.\n\nShapiro, who met with Harris on Sunday about the job, said he was grateful to talk about \"her vision for the role and the campaign ahead.\"\n\n\"As I've said repeatedly over the past several weeks, the running mate decision was a deeply personal decision for the vice president - and it was also a deeply personal decision for me. Pennsylvanians elected me to a four-year term as their governor, and my work here is far from finished - there is a lot more stuff I want to get done for the good people of this commonwealth,\" Shapiro said in a statement.\n\nHe said he considers Walz a good friend and pledged to travel the state over the next three months to help Democrats defeat former President Donald Trump \"and build a better future for our country.\"\n\n\"Vice President Kamala Harris has my enthusiastic support - and I know that Governor Tim Walz is an exceptionally strong addition to the ticket who will help Kamala move our country forward,\" Shapiro said.\n\nAt the Governor's mansion, a Minnesota resident says why he likes Walz\n\nDavid Ivory, 46, stood outside the Governor's mansion with his two children. Ivory found out Walz was selected after his wife texted him \"OMG\" from work.\n\nHe and his kids immediately hopped on their bikes and rode to the Governor's residence in St. Paul.\n\nIvory and his family are longtime admirers of Walz for his liberal record and amiable political persona.\n\n\"He's just down to earth. He gets it. He can talk to anybody,\" Ivory said. \"He doesn't seem like he's above anybody. He was a teacher. He understands kids, which is very important.\"\n\nHarris says her new running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has 'delivered for working families'\n\n\"It's great to have him on the team,\" Harris said.\n\nHarris posted on X that she was proud to announce she asked Walz to join her on the 2024 ticket.\n\nVoter Coalition Pushes Issue-Based Outreach Strategy to Increase Registration, Shifting from Top of Ticket Politics\n\nState Voices launched a $3 million nationwide campaign Tuesday to encourage voters of color to vote based on the issues that affect their day-to-day lives, like grocery price spikes or growing rent and mortgage payments.\n\nUnder the Vote for Something campaign, the coalition aims to register 800,000 voters, make more than 250 million voter contacts, and encourage 100,000 people to make a plan to vote on or ahead of the 2024 election for themselves and others.\n\nThey've registered more than 400,000 voters so far.\n\nState Voices, like many voting rights advocates, hopes for messaging that transcends the top of the ticket -- a looming match between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\"Whatever the issue is that matters to you, vote for something. Get out this November and bring a friend and a family member with you,\" said Mishara Davis, the group's director of issue and electoral organizing.\n\nThe key has been reaching voters who may be tired of the political space altogether or who are eligible to vote but aren't registered and therefore may not receive voting information -- especially in presidential swing states, Georgia, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, which are primary areas under the campaign.\n\nThis comes as Harris, who is in Pennsylvania this week, has chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, sources say. The pair will continue the campaign tour to Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada starting Wednesday.\n\nEnvironmental group cheers selection of Walz as the Democratic vice presidential candidate\n\nManish Bapna, president and CEO of the NRDC Action Fund, the political arm of the Natural Resources Defense Council, called Harris and Walz \"the winning ticket on climate. The Harris-Walz administration will be ready, on day one, to build on the strongest climate action ever and lead by example in the global fight against the existential challenge of our time.''\n\nWalz has made Minnesota a national climate leader, Bapna said. Under his leadership, the state committed to 100% clean energy by 2040, and Minnesota was the first Midwestern state to adopt California's strict tailpipe emissions standards. Walz also signed a bill last year directing $240 million to replace lead service water lines statewide.\n\n\"The stakes in this election couldn't be higher nor the choice more clear. Trump would bow to billionaire oil and gas donors, slam climate progress into reverse and leave our kids to pay the price. Harris is a proven climate and justice leader with two decades of public service on the front lines of needed progress and change. She's shown us what leadership looks like, and she's earned the chance to lead,\" Bapna said.\n\nThe National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund praises Walz's selection\n\n\"The National LGBTQ Action Fund expected a strategic and bold choice as a strong addition to the ticket as a Vice-Presidential candidate,\" Sayre E. Reece, vice president of the National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, said Tuesday in a statement. \"In Governor Walz we have gotten both.\"\n\nReece continued: \"Governor Walz has been a steadfast ally and advocate for the LGBTQ community, including support for trans affirming care, bodily autonomy and reproductive freedom and gun control. As Governor, Walz signed a ban on so-called 'conversion therapy' into law, ending the harmful and cruel practice that has cost LGBTQ people their dignity and their lives. Under Walz's leadership, Minnesota is both a 'trans sanctuary' and immigration sanctuary state.\"\n\nThe National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund describes itself as lobbying for legislation and ballot initiatives that \"achieve justice\" for LGBTQ people.\n\nAt Walz's residence in Minnesota\n\nA growing crowd of residents and news reporters gathered outside Walz's residence in St. Paul, Minnesota, on Tuesday morning.\n\nBlack and white SUVs periodically pulled into the driveway as onlookers waited to catch a glimpse of Walz leaving the 20-room governor's mansion near the Mississippi River.\n\nNo immediate comment from Vance on Harris picking Walz as her running mate\n\nBoarding his campaign plane Tuesday morning in Cincinnati for a swing through battleground states this week, Ohio Sen. JD Vance did not answer shouted questions about Harris picking Walz as her running mate.\n\nOn Tuesday, Vance was heading to Pennsylvania, where Harris planned to debut with her new running mate later in the day.\n\nTrump attacks Walz in a fundraising email\n\nDonald Trump sent a fundraising email calling Walz \"Dangerously Liberal\" and saying he would \"unleash HELL ON EARTH.\"\n\nMoments after Harris' VP pick became public, the former president and Republican nominee said Walz would be the worst vice president in history, claiming the Minnesota governor would \"light TRILLIONS of dollars on fire\" and open U.S. borders to criminals.\n\n\"HE'S THAT BAD,\" the email says.\n\nThe selection process that led Harris to pick Walz as her running mate\n\nA team of lawyers and political operatives led by former attorney general Eric Holder pored over documents and conducted interviews with potential vice presidential selections.\n\nAnd Harris herself met with her three finalists on Sunday. She mulled the decision over Monday with top aides at the vice president's residence in Washington and finalized it Tuesday morning.\n\nWalz emerged as the choice.\n\nA Minnesota Democratic strategist praises Walz's ability to connect with voters\n\nMinnesota Democratic strategist Abu Amara says Walz will be a good surrogate for Harris across the upper Midwest, because he represented a rural U.S. House district but won statewide in a state with large metropolitan and suburban areas.\n\n\"He's not trying to speak in poetry. He speaks in practicality,\" Amara said. \"That's a level of accessibility for so many voters.\"\n\n\"He has the ability to connect with rural, suburban and urban voters,\" he said.\n\nSome Republicans are already reacting to the selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as Harris' VP pick\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis called it the \"most left-wing ticket in American history\" and accused Walz of not doing enough to protect Minnesota during the 2020 protests over the killing of George Floyd.\n\nHe said \"Walz sat by and let Minneapolis burn.\"\n\nTropical Storm Debby continues to upend Harris' travel plans this week\n\nThe campaign had already pulled down a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, because of the weather.\n\nBut the Democratic presidential nominee will now no longer travel to Raleigh, North Carolina, either, according to the campaign. She was set to travel to Raleigh on Thursday.\n\nHarris is launching a tour of battleground states on Tuesday evening, starting in Philadelphia.\n\nHarris picks Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as running mate, AP sources say\n\nVice President Kamala Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday. That's according to three people who spoke to The Associated Press.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she's turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families. The people were not authorized to speak publicly about the choice and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.\n\n-- Seung Min Kim, Zeke Miller and Colleen Long\n\nSources say Harris has decided on a running mate\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has decided on a running mate and an announcement is expected in the coming hours before the two appear together at a Philadelphia rally, according to three people familiar with her decision.\n\nIn recent days, she has zeroed in on a trio of potential finalists: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. It wasn't clear yet who she picked.\n\nThe people were familiar with her plans but spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that had not been publicly announced.\n\nHarris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\n-- Seung Min Kim, Zeke Miller and Colleen Long\n\nHarris formally secures the Democratic presidential nomination\n\nVice President Kamala Harris formally secured the Democratic presidential nomination late Monday -- becoming the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket.\n\nHarris' nomination became official after a five-day round of online balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates ended Monday night, with the party saying in a statement released just before midnight that 99% of delegates casting ballots had done so for Harris. It said it would next formally certify the vote before holding a celebratory roll call at the party's convention later this month in Chicago.\n\nHarris' coronation as her party's standard-bearer caps a tumultuous and frenetic period for Democrats prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous June debate performance.\n\nAs soon as Biden abruptly ended his candidacy, Harris and her team worked rapidly to secure backing from the 1,976 party delegates needed to clinch the nomination in a formal roll call vote. She reached that marker at warp speed, with an Associated Press survey of delegates nationwide showing she locked down the necessary commitments a mere 32 hours after Biden's announcement.\n\nFOX41 Yakima©FOX11 TriCities©"],"source":{"uri":["fox41yakima.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["FOX 11 41 Tri Cities Yakima"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://www.fox41yakima.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fox41-Local-News-2.jpg"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.051],"wgt":[460679650],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8262540911"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-06"],"time":["22:32:58"],"dateTime":["2024-08-06T22:32:58Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-06T22:31:07Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.fox41yakima.com/fact-focus-false-claims-follow-minnesota-governors-selection-as-harris-running-mate/"],"title":["FACT FOCUS: False claims follow Minnesota governor's selection as Harris' running mate | Fox 11 Tri Cities Fox 41 Yakima"],"body":["Vice President Kamala Harris' announcement on Tuesday that Minnesota Gov.

That will age you,\" another argued in the comments.\n\nA third joked, \"I mean, he's just Country 60, he got Bubba Energy, which is NOT a bad thing, we kinda need Bubba Energy on the ticket.\"\n\n\"(Note: A Bubba is *not* a Redneck.

The flag was compared online with flags from states in Somalia that have green, white and blue stripes and a star.

Tim Walz will be her running mate in the 2024 presidential election increased the spread of false claims about the Midwestern Democrat, some of which appeared on social media even before Harris made her pick public.\n\nCLAIM: Walz said on CNN that he wants to invest in a \"ladder factory\" to help people scale the wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and illegally enter the U.S.\n\nTHE FACTS: That's false. Posts are misrepresenting a comment Walz made on an episode of CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360\" last week. In the full segment, the Democrat criticizes former President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall on the southern border by joking about the hypothetical investment. He then gives multiple other examples of how to address illegal crossings into the U.S. through Mexico.\n\nAmid Harris' Tuesday announcement, social media users used a clip from the segment to make it seem as though the Minnesota governor was advocating for illegal immigration.\n\n\"He talks about this wall, I always say, 'let me know how high it is, if it's 25 feet then I'll invest in a 30-foot-ladder factory,'\" Walz says, referencing Trump. \"That's not how you stop this.\"\n\nOne X post that shared the clip reads: \"FLASHBACK: Kamala's VP pick, Tim Walz, says he should invest in a 'ladder factory' to help illegal aliens climb the border wall.\"\n\nBut Walz was not offering to help people enter the U.S. without authorization. He was actually discussing how to prevent this from happening.\n\nIn the full segment, after making the investment quip, Walz gives alternative ideas for how to handle illegal crossings on the southern border. Arrests for such crossings reached a record high in December, but dropped to a new low for the Biden administration at the end of July following a temporary ban on asylum.\n\n\"You stop this using electronics, you stop it using more border control agents and you stop it by having a legal system that allows for that tradition of allowing folks to come here just like my relatives did,\" Walz says near the end of the segment. \"To come here, be able to work and establish the American dream.\"\n\nHe also spoke in support of a bipartisan border security package intended to cut back on illegal crossings that the Senate voted down in February.\n\n-- Associated Press writer Melissa Goldin contributed this report.\n\n___\n\nCLAIM: Walz changed the Minnesota flag so that it resembles the Somali flag.\n\nTHE FACTS: Minnesota did unfurl a new state flag and accompanying seal in May, but the changes were made to replace an old design that Native Americans said reminded them of painful memories of conquest and displacement. The State Emblems Redesign Commission was established during the 2023 legislative session to oversee the development of a new design.\n\nChanges were made to eliminate an old state seal that featured the image of a Native American riding off into the sunset while a white settler plowed his field with a rifle at the ready. The seal was a key feature of the old flag.\n\nThe commission included public officials, design experts and members of tribal and other communities of color. Its purpose statement dictated that the designs \"must accurately and respectfully reflect Minnesota's shared history, resources, and diverse cultural communities. Symbols, emblems, or likenesses that represent only a single community or person, regardless of whether real or stylized, may not be included in a design.\"\n\nThe public submitted more than 2,600 proposals and the commission picked one from Andrew Prekker, 25, of Luverne, as the basis for the flag.\n\nPrekker said Walz had nothing to do with the creation of the flag, and Somalia had nothing to do with the flag design.

Tim Walz as her running mate, looking to strengthen the Democratic ticket in Midwestern states\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, looking to strengthen the Democratic ticket in Midwestern states.\n\nShe introduced Walz at a rally Tuesday evening in Philadelphia.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a deadline last week. She officially claimed the nomination Monday night when the DNC released final results.\n\nFollow the AP's Election-2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nHarris and Walz take the stage\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has made her first appearance with her newly chosen running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nHarris and Walz have taken the stage together at a packed rally in Philadelphia. The pair ignited sustained cheers as they appeared before thousands at Temple University's Liacouras Center.\n\nWalz, the 60-year-old governor and former U.S. House member from rural south central Minnesota, put his hands together and bowed to the crowd. He stood alongside Harris as she waved to the audience and put her hand over her heart, wrapping the other around Walz.\n\nAccording to excerpts provided by the campaign, Walz plans to use his speech to say that Minnesota values are American values.\n\nBiden learned about Walz from Harris, not the news\n\n\"He heard it first from the vice president,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at her regular briefing. She said she couldn't \"pinpoint\" exactly where the president was when Harris called on Tuesday morning, but that he was somewhere in the executive mansion.\n\n\"She called him to let him know of her pick,\" Jean-Pierre said.\n\nHarris had sought Biden's advice during her search for a running mate, but Jean-Pierre left it there and declined to get into any specifics.\n\nBiden also spoke with Walz and congratulated him on his selection.\n\nPhiladelphia mayor calls for unity among Democrats\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker, who advocated fiercely but unsuccessfully for her state's governor, Josh Shapiro, to be Harris' running mate now says, \"Our Democratic nominee has spoken and that's it. Period. End of story.\"\n\nAt a rally in her city on Tuesday, Parker urged Pennsylvania Democrats to rally behind Harris' choice. Noting that Republicans and detractors would attempt to divide Democrats over the pick Parker says that the party can't let them.\n\nParker made headlines last week for posting a video praising Harris and Shapiro, which some thought suggested Harris had already picked Shapiro as her running mate. Instead, Harris chose Walz and the pair will appear together for the first time at the Philadelphia rally.\n\nThe last politician to face off against Tim Walz has some advice for JD Vance\n\nDr. Scott Jensen, a physician and former Republican Minnesota state senator, was the last political candidate to run against Walz in a general election but lost by nearly 8 points. Jensen says Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance should be prepared for Walz's fast-talking debate style. He also thinks Walz's appeal in rural areas has been overstated.\n\n\"Tim Walz can talk around a topic extremely effectively. He will give people the impression that he is the candidate of the common, everyday person,\" Jensen said. \"But if you look at the results of the 2022 election, Tim Walz really won the election because of the Twin Cities, Duluth and Rochester.\"\n\nHe also pointed out that in the 2022 governor's race, Walz lost many of the counties in the district he previously represented in Congress.\n\n\"Tim Walz lost the district in which the people who knew him best were offered the opportunity to make a decision about his candidacy,\" Jensen said. \"I think that's telling.\"\n\nTrump will sit for an interview with Elon Musk\n\nTrump says that he will do an interview with billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk next week. Musk endorsed the Republican for president after Trump survived an assassination attempt.\n\n\"ON MONDAY NIGHT I'LL BE DOING A MAJOR INTERVIEW WITH ELON MUSK -- Details to follow!\" Trump posted on his social media network.\n\nHis campaign did not immediately have more details to share.\n\nTrump, a longtime opponent of electric cars, said over the weekend at his rally in Atlanta that he favors electric cars \"for a small slice\" of the population, saying, \"I have to be, you know, because Elon endorsed me very strongly.\" He added: \"So I have no choice.\"\n\nExpect Walz to extol Harris during his first running mate appearance\n\nAhead of a rally in Philadelphia, the Harris campaign has released experts of Walz's prepared remarks where he'll introduce himself to the nation, highlight his support for Harris and emphasize stopping Trump at the ballot.\n\nWalz will say that the vice president \"has fought on the side of the American people\" and \"brings joy to everything she does.\"\n\n\"Minnesota's strength comes from our values -- our commitment to working together, to seeing past our differences, to lending a helping hand,\" Walz plans to tell the rally. \"Donald Trump -- he sees the world differently. He doesn't know the first thing about service -- because he's too busy serving himself.\"\n\nThe phone call that sealed the deal\n\nWearing khakis and a camouflage baseball cap, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz accepted a phone call from Vice President Kamala Harris. The Harris campaign has posted a video of the call on social media.\n\n\"Hi, this is Tim,\" Walz said into his phone.\n\n\"It's Kamala Harris. Good morning, governor,\" the Democratic nominee said with a big smile. \"Listen, I want you to do this with me. Let's do this together. Would you be my running mate?\"\n\n\"I would be honored, madame vice president,\" Walz said.\n\nThe two exchanged pleasantries over the roughly minute-long video and Harris ended the call with an, \"All right, buddy. I'll see you soon. Take care.\"\n\nThe campaign said it has raised more than $10 million from \"grassroots supporters alone\" since Walz became her running mate.\n\nVoter Voices: 'I was open for whoever she picked'\n\nMarnie Fowler, a 44-year-old Philadelphia who works in concert touring, wore a blue T-shirt she recently purchased online that said: \"Childless Cat Lady,\" a reference to remarks by GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance. Farlow said she wanted Walz all along. \"He's America's dad,\" Farlow said. \"Everything he's done in Minnesota aligns with my values.\"\n\nCheryl Pitts, a 77-year-old retired state worker from Sicklerville, New Jersey, said she was \"a little bit\" disappointed that Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro wasn't picked, \"but it won't stop us from voting; it didn't diminish my excitement.\" She called Walz \"a regular kind of guy that I can believe what he says.\"\n\nBernie Strain, 66, wore a shirt he made himself for the rally that said: \"OLD WHITE MEN FOR HARRIS & FREEDOM.\" Strain said he'd met Shapiro through politics but was ready to support whoever Harris selected. \"I was open for whoever she picked,\" he said. \"I was going to support them with both feet.\"\n\nA Republican strategist actually praising Harris' VP pick\n\nMark Campbell is a rare Republican who's publicly praising Harris' choice of Walz, calling it \"a home run.\"\n\nCampbell, a veteran GOP strategist who managed Glenn Youngkin's winning 2021 Virginia governor's campaign, ticked through a number of areas he suggests Walz reinforces Harris, first as an authentic surrogate in the northern battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nAn enlisted Army veteran, \"not officer class,\" Walz is \"plainspoken, folksy in a way that will play well in the burbs and rural areas,\" Cambell said.\n\nHe's \"progressive, but not too far from center,\" he said, and will align with \"Harris on policy 90% of the time.\" Campbell called the selection \"rock steady.\"\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says Walz is a good pick for Harris' running mate\n\nBeshear said it was \"a true honor of a lifetime\" to be considered for Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate and that\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz was a good pick.\n\n\"He is a great friend,\" Beshear told reporters outside his office in the Kentucky Capitol on Tuesday afternoon. \"He'd be an amazing vice president. I am 100% onboard with doing everything I can to elect the Harris-Walz ticket this November.\"\n\nBeshear declined to comment on the process -- when he was interviewed for the job and if he heard from Harris or her team Tuesday morning.\n\nMan who owned rights to HarrisWalz.com says he's sold the domain; declined to name the buyer\n\nJeremy Green Eche, the trademark lawyer who purchased HarrisWalz.com for $8.99 in 2020, sold the domain - and a slate of others linked to Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris - on Tuesday for $15,000, he told The Associated Press shortly after the order was made.\n\nEche declined to say who bought the domains, but said they have \"no obvious connection to either campaign or anything political.\"\n\nHarris selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate Tuesday.\n\nEche bought the rights to the site and others in 2020 when the would-be vice president was in the midst of a primary campaign for president. When he learned Walz was the pick, Eche was particularly excited, both because the Harris supporter liked Walz best out of the men the vice president was considering, and because it meant someone paying his $15,000 asking price was more likely.\n\nNow that the site was sold, however, Eche says he feels glad but odd.\n\n\"I feel strange,\" he said, \"like it happened too soon.\"\n\nThe domains were sold on the website for Eche's start-up, Communer, a forum that allows people to buy and sell domains and trademarks online. Eche said the website will now draw up a domain transfer contract between himself and the buyer.\n\nGroup founded by Republican women opposed to Trump support Walz\n\nA group founded in June by current and former Republican women who oppose Donald Trump for president came out in favor of Walz as Harris' pick, in part for Walz's fiscal measures and policy accomplishments aimed at women.\n\n\"As Governor, he's cut taxes for the middle class while balancing the budget, supported paid family leave so new mothers can be home to care for their children, expanded access to pre-kindergarten, and make sure that no Minnesotan child goes hungry at school,\" a release from Women4U.S. states.\n\nThe group is a federal superPAC whose honorary advisers include former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, former New Hampshire Republican Chair Jennifer Horn and founding editor of The Weekly Standard, Bill Kristol.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi welcomes Walz to the race\n\nSpeaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi welcomed the Minnesotan to what she called the Harris-Walz \"freedom ticket.\"\n\n\"In the Congress, I saw firsthand Tim Walz's leadership, collaborative spirit and effectiveness in bringing people together and getting the job done,\" Pelosi said in a statement.\n\nThe former Democratic House speaker was pivotal in reshaping the presidential race as President Joe Biden stepped aside and she said the field of potential VP candidates \"demonstrated the strength and vitality of the next generation of Democratic leadership.\"\n\nWisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin: 'We're thrilled to see a fellow Midwesterner at the top of the ticket'\n\nIt didn't take Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin long to seize on Harris' selection of Walz as a fundraising tool for her competitive reelection campaign.\n\n\"We're thrilled to see a fellow Midwesterner at the top of the ticket,\" Baldwin said in a fundraising email sent late Tuesday morning.\n\nBaldwin, seeking a third term, is among several incumbent Democratic senators seeking reelection in states viewed as pivotal to the presidential campaign, and where an uptick in enthusiasm since Harris' takeover of Joe Biden's campaign has lifted the party's hope of holding the seat.\n\nBaldwin spoke at Harris' first campaign stop as a candidate last month, an upbeat rally in suburban Milwaukee.\n\n\"Wisconsin has emerged as the tipping point state that will determine who wins the White House and which party controls the Senate,\" Baldwin's email said.\n\nBiden carried Wisconsin in 2020 by fewer than 21,000 votes.\n\nVoto Latino co-founder says Walz as running mate will help energize Latino voters\n\nVoto Latino co-founder and President Maria Teresa Kumar said Walz's selection to the ticket would help energize Latino voters who want a more inclusive democracy.\n\nKumar said in a statement that Walz's \"strong record of defending democracy, protecting voting rights, and standing up for working families in Minnesota aligns perfectly with the values our organization and the Latino community hold dear.\"\n\nShe added that she knows the vice president and governor personally and knows they'll represent a powerful voice for \"progress, equality and opportunity for Latino communities and all Americans.\"\n\nSen. Mark Kelly urges supporters to contribute to the Harris-Walz ticket\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly said he and his wife, former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, will do everything they can to elect Harris and Walz after Kelly was passed over for the Democratic ticket.\n\nKelly sent an email to supporters urging them to contribute to the Harris-Walz ticket.\n\n\"Tim has years of experience representing Minnesota both in the House of Representatives, where he served with Gabby, and as Minnesota's governor,\" Kelly wrote. \"In that time, he has shown up time and time again for working families and I know he'll continue that work in the White House.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the head of GIFFORDS, a gun-control advocacy group founded by Kelly and Giffords, called Walz \"a strong gun safety champion.\"\n\n\"Gun violence is a top concern for Americans this election cycle and we know the Harris-Walz ticket is the only one that will stand up to the gun lobby and save lives,\" said GIFFORDS Executive Director Emma Brown, who managed Kelly's 2022 Senate campaign and was his deputy campaign manager when in his first race two years earlier 2020.\n\nVance blames Harris' policies for drug addiction deaths\n\nVance is aiming to tie what he portrays as Harris' failures along the U.S.-Mexico border to deaths from drug addiction.\n\nVance told several hundred supporters gathered in a South Philadelphia event space that, \"thanks to the policies of Kamala Harris, you've got children who've been orphaned\" when their parents die from drugs.\n\nSeveral Pennsylvanians shared personal stories of how addiction issues have impacted their families.\n\nAs he has over several speeches and interviews in recent weeks, Vance told his own story related to drug addition, noting that his mother has been drug-free for a decade but, as a child, he was \"desperately hoping and praying, Jesus, please let her wake up from this.\"\n\nU.S. government data undercuts the claim that people seeking asylum and other border crossers are responsible for drug trafficking. At a hearing last year, James Mandryck, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection deputy assistant commissioner, said 73% of fentanyl seizures at the border since the previous October were smuggling attempts carried out by U.S. citizens, with the rest being done by Mexican citizens.\n\nBarack and Michelle Obama say Harris 'has chosen an ideal partner'\n\n\"Governor Walz doesn't just have the experience to be vice president, he has the values and the integrity to make us proud,\" the former president and first lady said in a statement.\n\nThey said Walz enacted progressive priorities as Minnesota governor including paid family leave, abortion rights and gun safety measures.\n\n\"But Tim's signature is his ability to talk like a human being and treat everyone with decency and respect,\" the Obamas said.\n\nVance says he tried to get Walz on the phone\n\nThe Republican told reporters aboard his campaign plane Tuesday that he called Walz earlier in the day but \"I left him a voicemail, I didn't get him.\"\n\nIt's not clear if there will be a debate between Vance and Walz. Last week, Trump said he wouldn't take part in an ABC News debate that had been on the books for September because he made that agreement with Biden before the president exited the campaign.\n\nInstead, Trump said he would debate Harris on Sept. 4 on Fox News, but the vice president hasn't agreed to that time or network yet.\n\nPresident Joe Biden calls Harris-Walz ticket 'a powerful voice for working people' and middle class\n\nBiden called on Democrats and all Americans to rally behind them.\n\n\"They will be the strongest defenders of our personal freedoms and our democracy,\" Biden said in a social media post. \"And they will ensure that America continues to lead the world and play its role as the indispensable nation.\"\n\nBiden said choosing a running mate is a party nominee's first major decision and praised Harris' choice. He said he's known Walz for nearly two decades, praising his background as a teacher, football coach and National Guard soldier.\n\n\"Every generation of Americans faces a moment where they are asked to defend American democracy,\" Biden said. \"That moment is now.\"\n\nWhite House Senior Deputy Press Secretary Emilie Simons says Biden and Harris spoke on the phone Tuesday morning ahead of the official announcement that she selected Walz and that Biden spoke with Walz to congratulate him.\n\nVance says Walz pick as running mate 'highlights how radical' Harris is\n\nIn his first public comments since his general election foe was set, JD Vance on Tuesday called Walz a choice that \"highlights how radical Kamala Harris is.\"\n\nIn a gaggle with reporters aboard his campaign plane upon landing in Philadelphia, Vance said Walz \"is a person who listens to the Hamas wing\" of the Democratic Party and \"who wants to make the American people more reliant on garbage energy instead of good American energy.\"\n\nVance is speaking more to reporters in Philadelphia on Tuesday ahead of campaign events across Midwestern battleground states on Wednesday, in a path that somewhat mirrors Harris and Walz's planned trajectory.\n\nFormer colleagues on Capitol Hill appear thrilled with Walz as the VP pick\n\n\"Great choice,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\n\"Having served for years with Tim in the House of Representatives, I can say without reservation: there's no better person Vice President Harris could have picked to run and then govern alongside her,\" said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md.\n\nWalz \"has always put our country first,\" Van Hollen said, and he's excited to campaign for the Harris-Walz ticket for \"a brighter future for all Americans.\"\n\nRep. Mark Takano of California recalled how after Walz beat him during an internal House caucus vote to become the top Democrat on the Veterans Affairs Committee, his colleague \"immediately brought me into the fold because that's the type of leader he is: a collaborative bridge builder.\"\n\nAnd Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, who entered Congress with Walz in 2007, said he \"has always had this very straightforward, direct, open approach to things.\"\n\nWelch described Walz as \"one of these guys in the gym who wouldn't undo his tie\" because it would be faster for him to get back to work.\n\nPolling shows the appeal of Tim Walz's biography\n\nTim Walz's biography as a military veteran and former high school teacher - two broadly trusted professions - may also help him appeal to Americans as he campaigns with Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAbout 9 in 10 U.S. adults say they have a favorable opinion of military veterans, generally, according to an Ipsos poll conducted in 2024. About 8 in 10 say that about school teachers. Both measures are much higher than for government employees or elected officials. Republicans are slightly more likely than Democrats to have a positive view of veterans, while Democrats are a bit more likely to have a favorable opinion of those in a teaching career.\n\nGallup polling from 2022 found that high school teachers are generally held in high regard among Americans for their honesty and ethical standards. About half, 53%, gave them at least a high rating on ethics.\n\nAP VoteCast shows Tim Walz's electoral strengths and weakness in Minnesota\n\nDemocratic nominee Kamala Harris is hoping her VP choice, Tim Walz, will strengthen the Democratic ticket in Midwestern states and among working class voters.\n\nAP VoteCast shows that when Walz was elected Minnesota governor in 2022, he won young voters in the state. He also did well in Minnesota's union households, winning nearly 6 in 10 voters in that group. About half of Minnesota voters, 52%, had a favorable view of Walz, and about 4 in 10 had a negative one.\n\nAnd while Walz lost white voters without a college education in the state, he outperformed Democrats nationwide with this group. He also struggled among white men, a demographic Democrats have sought to win back from President Donald Trump, but did a little better among this group than Democrats nationwide.\n\nHowever, Walz lost among military veteran households in Minnesota in 2022, according to VoteCast.\n\nTim Walz will need to introduce himself to America\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz will need to introduce himself to the vast majority of Americans.\n\nAn ABC News/Ipsos survey conducted before Walz was selected as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, but after vetting began, showed that nearly 9 in 10 U.S. adults did not know enough to have an opinion about him. Among Americans with a view, opinions were split between positive and negative: 6% had a favorable view, and 7% had an unfavorable one.\n\nWalz's lack of a national profile as he joins Harris on the campaign trail extends to his own party. Nearly 9 in 10 Democrats also didn't know enough to have an opinion of Walz in the ABC News/Ipsos poll. One in 10 had a favorable view of him, and just 4% had a negative opinion. He was an unknown figure among most Democrats across the party: those older and younger were similarly likely to not know Walz, as well as white Democrats and non-white Democrats.\n\nFellow Minnesotan Sen. Amy Klobuchar says Walz is 'just unendingly optimistic and joyous'\n\nU.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar says Walz is someone who is \"just unendingly optimistic and joyous, and that is very, very important right now in our politics.\"\n\nThe fellow Minnesotan who served with Walz in Congress told The Associated Press \"he's blunt, but he's also positive\" in a way she believes will provide an upbeat message in contrast to the Trump-Vance Republican ticket.\n\n\"I always think of him in his plaid shirt because he was always making the point it's 'One Minnesota,'\" said Klobuchar, a Democrat. \"And I think that's a point you're going hear him talk about with our nation.\"\n\nShe said his background as a hunter and someone who fishes \"just brings a different perspective to the White House.\"\n\nSeveral black and white SUVs have left the Governor's residence in St. Paul\n\nThe SUVs left amid cheers from residents lined up on the sidewalk.\n\nHarris' running mate pick is good news for man who owns rights to HarrisWalz.com\n\nJeremy Green Eche was in the middle of getting his toddler dressed the moment news broke that Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris had selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate.\n\nAnd he was amped.\n\nEche was uniquely invested in Harris' pick. He currently owns the rights to HarrisWalz.com, a site he bought in 2020 -- along with a slate of other Harris sites -- when the would-be vice president was in the midst of a primary campaign for president. Four years and one vice presidential pick later, Eche is willing to sell the slate of Harris websites, including the one featuring Walz, for $15,000.\n\n\"I was constantly refreshing four different news sites on my phone,\" he told The Associated Press on Tuesday. \"I was very excited.\" He said he \"almost immediately\" began getting calls from both journalists and \"friends I hadn't heard from in a while.\"\n\nThis is not a new scenario for the 36-year-old trademark lawyer in Brooklyn, New York. Eche is a cyber squatter, someone who buys a domain with someone else's name or brand in it for very little money, hoping to sell it to that person or brand for a large profit in the subsequent months or years. In 2011, when it looked likely that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would be the Democratic nominee in 2016, then Jeremy Peter Green - he took his wife's last name - purchased ClintonKaine.com.\n\nAfter the former secretary of state picked Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, the squatter offered it to the campaign for a hefty return. They declined, so he sold it for $15,000 to a digital marketing company that turned out to be the Trump campaign. The website pushed anti-Clinton news with \"Paid for by Donald J. Trump for President, Inc\" emblazoned at the bottom.\n\nEche supported Clinton in 2016 and supports Harris today. The prospect of something like that happening again doesn't give Eche pause, however.\n\n\"The Harris campaign has hundreds of millions of dollars, so if they don't buy their own domain, that is kind of on them,\" he said Monday. But he isn't convinced they will buy the domain.\n\n\"I don't want to be too confident that somebody will reach out,\" he said after Walz was selected. \"I would say there's a 75% chance that one of the campaigns, or a PAC, will buy it from me.\"\n\nWalz says he's 'all in'\n\nIn a Tuesday morning post on X, Walz said joining the ticket with Harris is \"the honor of a lifetime.\"\n\nHis profile details on X are now \"Running to win this thing with @kamalaharris.\"\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro on Walz\n\nShapiro called Walz \"an exceptionally strong addition to the ticket\" who'll help Harris become the 47th president.\n\nShapiro, who met with Harris on Sunday about the job, said he was grateful to talk about \"her vision for the role and the campaign ahead.\"\n\n\"As I've said repeatedly over the past several weeks, the running mate decision was a deeply personal decision for the vice president - and it was also a deeply personal decision for me. Pennsylvanians elected me to a four-year term as their governor, and my work here is far from finished - there is a lot more stuff I want to get done for the good people of this commonwealth,\" Shapiro said in a statement.\n\nHe said he considers Walz a good friend and pledged to travel the state over the next three months to help Democrats defeat former President Donald Trump \"and build a better future for our country.\"\n\n\"Vice President Kamala Harris has my enthusiastic support - and I know that Governor Tim Walz is an exceptionally strong addition to the ticket who will help Kamala move our country forward,\" Shapiro said.\n\nAt the Governor's mansion, a Minnesota resident says why he likes Walz\n\nDavid Ivory, 46, stood outside the Governor's mansion with his two children. Ivory found out Walz was selected after his wife texted him \"OMG\" from work.\n\nHe and his kids immediately hopped on their bikes and rode to the Governor's residence in St. Paul.\n\nIvory and his family are longtime admirers of Walz for his liberal record and amiable political persona.\n\n\"He's just down to earth. He gets it. He can talk to anybody,\" Ivory said. \"He doesn't seem like he's above anybody. He was a teacher. He understands kids, which is very important.\"\n\nHarris says her new running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has 'delivered for working families'\n\n\"It's great to have him on the team,\" Harris said.\n\nHarris posted on X that she was proud to announce she asked Walz to join her on the 2024 ticket.\n\nVoter Coalition Pushes Issue-Based Outreach Strategy to Increase Registration, Shifting from Top of Ticket Politics\n\nState Voices launched a $3 million nationwide campaign Tuesday to encourage voters of color to vote based on the issues that affect their day-to-day lives, like grocery price spikes or growing rent and mortgage payments.\n\nUnder the Vote for Something campaign, the coalition aims to register 800,000 voters, make more than 250 million voter contacts, and encourage 100,000 people to make a plan to vote on or ahead of the 2024 election for themselves and others.\n\nThey've registered more than 400,000 voters so far.\n\nState Voices, like many voting rights advocates, hopes for messaging that transcends the top of the ticket -- a looming match between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\"Whatever the issue is that matters to you, vote for something. Get out this November and bring a friend and a family member with you,\" said Mishara Davis, the group's director of issue and electoral organizing.\n\nThe key has been reaching voters who may be tired of the political space altogether or who are eligible to vote but aren't registered and therefore may not receive voting information -- especially in presidential swing states, Georgia, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, which are primary areas under the campaign.\n\nThis comes as Harris, who is in Pennsylvania this week, has chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, sources say. The pair will continue the campaign tour to Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada starting Wednesday.\n\nEnvironmental group cheers selection of Walz as the Democratic vice presidential candidate\n\nManish Bapna, president and CEO of the NRDC Action Fund, the political arm of the Natural Resources Defense Council, called Harris and Walz \"the winning ticket on climate. The Harris-Walz administration will be ready, on day one, to build on the strongest climate action ever and lead by example in the global fight against the existential challenge of our time.''\n\nWalz has made Minnesota a national climate leader, Bapna said. Under his leadership, the state committed to 100% clean energy by 2040, and Minnesota was the first Midwestern state to adopt California's strict tailpipe emissions standards. Walz also signed a bill last year directing $240 million to replace lead service water lines statewide.\n\n\"The stakes in this election couldn't be higher nor the choice more clear. Trump would bow to billionaire oil and gas donors, slam climate progress into reverse and leave our kids to pay the price. Harris is a proven climate and justice leader with two decades of public service on the front lines of needed progress and change. She's shown us what leadership looks like, and she's earned the chance to lead,\" Bapna said.\n\nThe National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund praises Walz's selection\n\n\"The National LGBTQ Action Fund expected a strategic and bold choice as a strong addition to the ticket as a Vice-Presidential candidate,\" Sayre E. Reece, vice president of the National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, said Tuesday in a statement. \"In Governor Walz we have gotten both.\"\n\nReece continued: \"Governor Walz has been a steadfast ally and advocate for the LGBTQ community, including support for trans affirming care, bodily autonomy and reproductive freedom and gun control. As Governor, Walz signed a ban on so-called 'conversion therapy' into law, ending the harmful and cruel practice that has cost LGBTQ people their dignity and their lives. Under Walz's leadership, Minnesota is both a 'trans sanctuary' and immigration sanctuary state.\"\n\nThe National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund describes itself as lobbying for legislation and ballot initiatives that \"achieve justice\" for LGBTQ people.\n\nAt Walz's residence in Minnesota\n\nA growing crowd of residents and news reporters gathered outside Walz's residence in St. Paul, Minnesota, on Tuesday morning.\n\nBlack and white SUVs periodically pulled into the driveway as onlookers waited to catch a glimpse of Walz leaving the 20-room governor's mansion near the Mississippi River.\n\nNo immediate comment from Vance on Harris picking Walz as her running mate\n\nBoarding his campaign plane Tuesday morning in Cincinnati for a swing through battleground states this week, Ohio Sen. JD Vance did not answer shouted questions about Harris picking Walz as her running mate.\n\nOn Tuesday, Vance was heading to Pennsylvania, where Harris planned to debut with her new running mate later in the day.\n\nTrump attacks Walz in a fundraising email\n\nDonald Trump sent a fundraising email calling Walz \"Dangerously Liberal\" and saying he would \"unleash HELL ON EARTH.\"\n\nMoments after Harris' VP pick became public, the former president and Republican nominee said Walz would be the worst vice president in history, claiming the Minnesota governor would \"light TRILLIONS of dollars on fire\" and open U.S. borders to criminals.\n\n\"HE'S THAT BAD,\" the email says.\n\nThe selection process that led Harris to pick Walz as her running mate\n\nA team of lawyers and political operatives led by former attorney general Eric Holder pored over documents and conducted interviews with potential vice presidential selections.\n\nAnd Harris herself met with her three finalists on Sunday. She mulled the decision over Monday with top aides at the vice president's residence in Washington and finalized it Tuesday morning.\n\nWalz emerged as the choice.\n\nA Minnesota Democratic strategist praises Walz's ability to connect with voters\n\nMinnesota Democratic strategist Abu Amara says Walz will be a good surrogate for Harris across the upper Midwest, because he represented a rural U.S. House district but won statewide in a state with large metropolitan and suburban areas.\n\n\"He's not trying to speak in poetry. He speaks in practicality,\" Amara said. \"That's a level of accessibility for so many voters.\"\n\n\"He has the ability to connect with rural, suburban and urban voters,\" he said.\n\nSome Republicans are already reacting to the selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as Harris' VP pick\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis called it the \"most left-wing ticket in American history\" and accused Walz of not doing enough to protect Minnesota during the 2020 protests over the killing of George Floyd.\n\nHe said \"Walz sat by and let Minneapolis burn.\"\n\nTropical Storm Debby continues to upend Harris' travel plans this week\n\nThe campaign had already pulled down a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, because of the weather.\n\nBut the Democratic presidential nominee will now no longer travel to Raleigh, North Carolina, either, according to the campaign. She was set to travel to Raleigh on Thursday.\n\nHarris is launching a tour of battleground states on Tuesday evening, starting in Philadelphia.\n\nHarris picks Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as running mate, AP sources say\n\nVice President Kamala Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday. That's according to three people who spoke to The Associated Press.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she's turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families. The people were not authorized to speak publicly about the choice and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.\n\n-- Seung Min Kim, Zeke Miller and Colleen Long\n\nSources say Harris has decided on a running mate\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has decided on a running mate and an announcement is expected in the coming hours before the two appear together at a Philadelphia rally, according to three people familiar with her decision.\n\nIn recent days, she has zeroed in on a trio of potential finalists: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. It wasn't clear yet who she picked.\n\nThe people were familiar with her plans but spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that had not been publicly announced.\n\nHarris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\n-- Seung Min Kim, Zeke Miller and Colleen Long\n\nHarris formally secures the Democratic presidential nomination\n\nVice President Kamala Harris formally secured the Democratic presidential nomination late Monday -- becoming the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket.\n\nHarris' nomination became official after a five-day round of online balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates ended Monday night, with the party saying in a statement released just before midnight that 99% of delegates casting ballots had done so for Harris. It said it would next formally certify the vote before holding a celebratory roll call at the party's convention later this month in Chicago.\n\nHarris' coronation as her party's standard-bearer caps a tumultuous and frenetic period for Democrats prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous June debate performance.\n\nAs soon as Biden abruptly ended his candidacy, Harris and her team worked rapidly to secure backing from the 1,976 party delegates needed to clinch the nomination in a formal roll call vote. She reached that marker at warp speed, with an Associated Press survey of delegates nationwide showing she locked down the necessary commitments a mere 32 hours after Biden's announcement."],"source":{"uri":["santamariatimes.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Santa Maria Times"]},"authors":[{"uri":["associated_press@santamariatimes.com"],"name":["Associated Press"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/santamariatimes.com/content/tncms/custom/image/b9c888ca-59a2-11eb-a31f-0b4d74fa96dc.jpg?resize=200%2C200"],"eventUri":["eng-9795783"],"sentiment":[0.0353],"wgt":[460679434],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["2024-08-446225253"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-06"],"time":["22:30:22"],"dateTime":["2024-08-06T22:30:22Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-06T21:48:11Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.maryvilleforum.com/news/state_news/fact-focus-false-claims-follow-minnesota-governors-selection-as-harris-running-mate/article_705cee79-1a3a-5e32-8d21-d16f60b40d7a.html"],"title":["FACT FOCUS: False claims follow Minnesota governor's selection as Harris' running mate"],"body":["The announcement that Vice President Kamala Harris had selected Minnesota Gov.

The seal was a key feature of the old flag.\n\nThe commission included public officials, design experts and members of tribal and other communities of color.

Tim Walz as her running mate, looking to strengthen the Democratic ticket in Midwestern states.\n\nShe introduced Walz at a rally Tuesday evening in Philadelphia.\n\nHarris was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by a deadline last week. She officially claimed the nomination Monday night when the DNC released final results.\n\nFollow the AP's Election-2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nHarris and Walz take the stage\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has made her first appearance with her newly chosen running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nHarris and Walz have taken the stage together at a packed rally in Philadelphia. The pair ignited sustained cheers as they appeared before thousands at Temple University's Liacouras Center.\n\nWalz, the 60-year-old governor and former U.S. House member from rural south central Minnesota, put his hands together and bowed to the crowd. He stood alongside Harris as she waved to the audience and put her hand over her heart, wrapping the other around Walz.\n\nAccording to excerpts provided by the campaign, Walz plans to use his speech to say that Minnesota values are American values.\n\nBiden learned about Walz from Harris, not the news\n\n\"He heard it first from the vice president,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at her regular briefing. She said she couldn't \"pinpoint\" exactly where the president was when Harris called on Tuesday morning, but that he was somewhere in the executive mansion.\n\n\"She called him to let him know of her pick,\" Jean-Pierre said.\n\nHarris had sought Biden's advice during her search for a running mate, but Jean-Pierre left it there and declined to get into any specifics.\n\nBiden also spoke with Walz and congratulated him on his selection.\n\nPhiladelphia mayor calls for unity among Democrats\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker, who advocated fiercely but unsuccessfully for her state's governor, Josh Shapiro, to be Harris' running mate now says, \"Our Democratic nominee has spoken and that's it. Period. End of story.\"\n\nAt a rally in her city on Tuesday, Parker urged Pennsylvania Democrats to rally behind Harris' choice. Noting that Republicans and detractors would attempt to divide Democrats over the pick Parker says that the party can't let them.\n\nParker made headlines last week for posting a video praising Harris and Shapiro, which some thought suggested Harris had already picked Shapiro as her running mate. Instead, Harris chose Walz and the pair will appear together for the first time at the Philadelphia rally.\n\nThe last politician to face off against Tim Walz has some advice for JD Vance\n\nDr. Scott Jensen, a physician and former Republican Minnesota state senator, was the last political candidate to run against Walz in a general election but lost by nearly 8 points. Jensen says Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance should be prepared for Walz's fast-talking debate style. He also thinks Walz's appeal in rural areas has been overstated.\n\n\"Tim Walz can talk around a topic extremely effectively. He will give people the impression that he is the candidate of the common, everyday person,\" Jensen said. \"But if you look at the results of the 2022 election, Tim Walz really won the election because of the Twin Cities, Duluth and Rochester.\"\n\nHe also pointed out that in the 2022 governor's race, Walz lost many of the counties in the district he previously represented in Congress.\n\n\"Tim Walz lost the district in which the people who knew him best were offered the opportunity to make a decision about his candidacy,\" Jensen said. \"I think that's telling.\"\n\nTrump will sit for an interview with Elon Musk\n\nTrump says that he will do an interview with billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk next week. Musk endorsed the Republican for president after Trump survived an assassination attempt.\n\n\"ON MONDAY NIGHT I'LL BE DOING A MAJOR INTERVIEW WITH ELON MUSK -- Details to follow!\" Trump posted on his social media network.\n\nHis campaign did not immediately have more details to share.\n\nTrump, a longtime opponent of electric cars, said over the weekend at his rally in Atlanta that he favors electric cars \"for a small slice\" of the population, saying, \"I have to be, you know, because Elon endorsed me very strongly.\" He added: \"So I have no choice.\"\n\nExpect Walz to extol Harris during his first running mate appearance\n\nAhead of a rally in Philadelphia, the Harris campaign has released experts of Walz's prepared remarks where he'll introduce himself to the nation, highlight his support for Harris and emphasize stopping Trump at the ballot.\n\nWalz will say that the vice president \"has fought on the side of the American people\" and \"brings joy to everything she does.\"\n\n\"Minnesota's strength comes from our values -- our commitment to working together, to seeing past our differences, to lending a helping hand,\" Walz plans to tell the rally. \"Donald Trump -- he sees the world differently. He doesn't know the first thing about service -- because he's too busy serving himself.\"\n\nThe phone call that sealed the deal\n\nWearing khakis and a camouflage baseball cap, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz accepted a phone call from Vice President Kamala Harris. The Harris campaign has posted a video of the call on social media.\n\n\"Hi, this is Tim,\" Walz said into his phone.\n\n\"It's Kamala Harris. Good morning, governor,\" the Democratic nominee said with a big smile. \"Listen, I want you to do this with me. Let's do this together. Would you be my running mate?\"\n\n\"I would be honored, madame vice president,\" Walz said.\n\nThe two exchanged pleasantries over the roughly minute-long video and Harris ended the call with an, \"All right, buddy. I'll see you soon. Take care.\"\n\nThe campaign said it has raised more than $10 million from \"grassroots supporters alone\" since Walz became her running mate.\n\nVoter Voices: 'I was open for whoever she picked'\n\nMarnie Fowler, a 44-year-old Philadelphia who works in concert touring, wore a blue T-shirt she recently purchased online that said: \"Childless Cat Lady,\" a reference to remarks by GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance. Farlow said she wanted Walz all along. \"He's America's dad,\" Farlow said. \"Everything he's done in Minnesota aligns with my values.\"\n\nCheryl Pitts, a 77-year-old retired state worker from Sicklerville, New Jersey, said she was \"a little bit\" disappointed that Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro wasn't picked, \"but it won't stop us from voting; it didn't diminish my excitement.\" She called Walz \"a regular kind of guy that I can believe what he says.\"\n\nBernie Strain, 66, wore a shirt he made himself for the rally that said: \"OLD WHITE MEN FOR HARRIS & FREEDOM.\" Strain said he'd met Shapiro through politics but was ready to support whoever Harris selected. \"I was open for whoever she picked,\" he said. \"I was going to support them with both feet.\"\n\nA Republican strategist actually praising Harris' VP pick\n\nMark Campbell is a rare Republican who's publicly praising Harris' choice of Walz, calling it \"a home run.\"\n\nCampbell, a veteran GOP strategist who managed Glenn Youngkin's winning 2021 Virginia governor's campaign, ticked through a number of areas he suggests Walz reinforces Harris, first as an authentic surrogate in the northern battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nAn enlisted Army veteran, \"not officer class,\" Walz is \"plainspoken, folksy in a way that will play well in the burbs and rural areas,\" Cambell said.\n\nHe's \"progressive, but not too far from center,\" he said, and will align with \"Harris on policy 90% of the time.\" Campbell called the selection \"rock steady.\"\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says Walz is a good pick for Harris' running mate\n\nBeshear said it was \"a true honor of a lifetime\" to be considered for Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate and that\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz was a good pick.\n\n\"He is a great friend,\" Beshear told reporters outside his office in the Kentucky Capitol on Tuesday afternoon. \"He'd be an amazing vice president. I am 100% onboard with doing everything I can to elect the Harris-Walz ticket this November.\"\n\nBeshear declined to comment on the process -- when he was interviewed for the job and if he heard from Harris or her team Tuesday morning.\n\nMan who owned rights to HarrisWalz.com says he's sold the domain; declined to name the buyer\n\nJeremy Green Eche, the trademark lawyer who purchased HarrisWalz.com for $8.99 in 2020, sold the domain - and a slate of others linked to Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris - on Tuesday for $15,000, he told The Associated Press shortly after the order was made.\n\nEche declined to say who bought the domains, but said they have \"no obvious connection to either campaign or anything political.\"\n\nHarris selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate Tuesday.\n\nEche bought the rights to the site and others in 2020 when the would-be vice president was in the midst of a primary campaign for president. When he learned Walz was the pick, Eche was particularly excited, both because the Harris supporter liked Walz best out of the men the vice president was considering, and because it meant someone paying his $15,000 asking price was more likely.\n\nNow that the site was sold, however, Eche says he feels glad but odd.\n\n\"I feel strange,\" he said, \"like it happened too soon.\"\n\nThe domains were sold on the website for Eche's start-up, Communer, a forum that allows people to buy and sell domains and trademarks online. Eche said the website will now draw up a domain transfer contract between himself and the buyer.\n\nGroup founded by Republican women opposed to Trump support Walz\n\nA group founded in June by current and former Republican women who oppose Donald Trump for president came out in favor of Walz as Harris' pick, in part for Walz's fiscal measures and policy accomplishments aimed at women.\n\n\"As Governor, he's cut taxes for the middle class while balancing the budget, supported paid family leave so new mothers can be home to care for their children, expanded access to pre-kindergarten, and make sure that no Minnesotan child goes hungry at school,\" a release from Women4U.S. states.\n\nThe group is a federal superPAC whose honorary advisers include former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, former New Hampshire Republican Chair Jennifer Horn and founding editor of The Weekly Standard, Bill Kristol.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi welcomes Walz to the race\n\nSpeaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi welcomed the Minnesotan to what she called the Harris-Walz \"freedom ticket.\"\n\n\"In the Congress, I saw firsthand Tim Walz's leadership, collaborative spirit and effectiveness in bringing people together and getting the job done,\" Pelosi said in a statement.\n\nThe former Democratic House speaker was pivotal in reshaping the presidential race as President Joe Biden stepped aside and she said the field of potential VP candidates \"demonstrated the strength and vitality of the next generation of Democratic leadership.\"\n\nWisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin: 'We're thrilled to see a fellow Midwesterner at the top of the ticket'\n\nIt didn't take Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin long to seize on Harris' selection of Walz as a fundraising tool for her competitive reelection campaign.\n\n\"We're thrilled to see a fellow Midwesterner at the top of the ticket,\" Baldwin said in a fundraising email sent late Tuesday morning.\n\nBaldwin, seeking a third term, is among several incumbent Democratic senators seeking reelection in states viewed as pivotal to the presidential campaign, and where an uptick in enthusiasm since Harris' takeover of Joe Biden's campaign has lifted the party's hope of holding the seat.\n\nBaldwin spoke at Harris' first campaign stop as a candidate last month, an upbeat rally in suburban Milwaukee.\n\n\"Wisconsin has emerged as the tipping point state that will determine who wins the White House and which party controls the Senate,\" Baldwin's email said.\n\nBiden carried Wisconsin in 2020 by fewer than 21,000 votes.\n\nVoto Latino co-founder says Walz as running mate will help energize Latino voters\n\nVoto Latino co-founder and President Maria Teresa Kumar said Walz's selection to the ticket would help energize Latino voters who want a more inclusive democracy.\n\nKumar said in a statement that Walz's \"strong record of defending democracy, protecting voting rights, and standing up for working families in Minnesota aligns perfectly with the values our organization and the Latino community hold dear.\"\n\nShe added that she knows the vice president and governor personally and knows they'll represent a powerful voice for \"progress, equality and opportunity for Latino communities and all Americans.\"\n\nSen. Mark Kelly urges supporters to contribute to the Harris-Walz ticket\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly said he and his wife, former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, will do everything they can to elect Harris and Walz after Kelly was passed over for the Democratic ticket.\n\nKelly sent an email to supporters urging them to contribute to the Harris-Walz ticket.\n\n\"Tim has years of experience representing Minnesota both in the House of Representatives, where he served with Gabby, and as Minnesota's governor,\" Kelly wrote. \"In that time, he has shown up time and time again for working families and I know he'll continue that work in the White House.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the head of GIFFORDS, a gun-control advocacy group founded by Kelly and Giffords, called Walz \"a strong gun safety champion.\"\n\n\"Gun violence is a top concern for Americans this election cycle and we know the Harris-Walz ticket is the only one that will stand up to the gun lobby and save lives,\" said GIFFORDS Executive Director Emma Brown, who managed Kelly's 2022 Senate campaign and was his deputy campaign manager when in his first race two years earlier 2020.\n\nVance blames Harris' policies for drug addiction deaths\n\nVance is aiming to tie what he portrays as Harris' failures along the U.S.-Mexico border to deaths from drug addiction.\n\nVance told several hundred supporters gathered in a South Philadelphia event space that, \"thanks to the policies of Kamala Harris, you've got children who've been orphaned\" when their parents die from drugs.\n\nSeveral Pennsylvanians shared personal stories of how addiction issues have impacted their families.\n\nAs he has over several speeches and interviews in recent weeks, Vance told his own story related to drug addition, noting that his mother has been drug-free for a decade but, as a child, he was \"desperately hoping and praying, Jesus, please let her wake up from this.\"\n\nU.S. government data undercuts the claim that people seeking asylum and other border crossers are responsible for drug trafficking. At a hearing last year, James Mandryck, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection deputy assistant commissioner, said 73% of fentanyl seizures at the border since the previous October were smuggling attempts carried out by U.S. citizens, with the rest being done by Mexican citizens.\n\nBarack and Michelle Obama say Harris 'has chosen an ideal partner'\n\n\"Governor Walz doesn't just have the experience to be vice president, he has the values and the integrity to make us proud,\" the former president and first lady said in a statement.\n\nThey said Walz enacted progressive priorities as Minnesota governor including paid family leave, abortion rights and gun safety measures.\n\n\"But Tim's signature is his ability to talk like a human being and treat everyone with decency and respect,\" the Obamas said.\n\nVance says he tried to get Walz on the phone\n\nThe Republican told reporters aboard his campaign plane Tuesday that he called Walz earlier in the day but \"I left him a voicemail, I didn't get him.\"\n\nIt's not clear if there will be a debate between Vance and Walz. Last week, Trump said he wouldn't take part in an ABC News debate that had been on the books for September because he made that agreement with Biden before the president exited the campaign.\n\nInstead, Trump said he would debate Harris on Sept. 4 on Fox News, but the vice president hasn't agreed to that time or network yet.\n\nPresident Joe Biden calls Harris-Walz ticket 'a powerful voice for working people' and middle class\n\nBiden called on Democrats and all Americans to rally behind them.\n\n\"They will be the strongest defenders of our personal freedoms and our democracy,\" Biden said in a social media post. \"And they will ensure that America continues to lead the world and play its role as the indispensable nation.\"\n\nBiden said choosing a running mate is a party nominee's first major decision and praised Harris' choice. He said he's known Walz for nearly two decades, praising his background as a teacher, football coach and National Guard soldier.\n\n\"Every generation of Americans faces a moment where they are asked to defend American democracy,\" Biden said. \"That moment is now.\"\n\nWhite House Senior Deputy Press Secretary Emilie Simons says Biden and Harris spoke on the phone Tuesday morning ahead of the official announcement that she selected Walz and that Biden spoke with Walz to congratulate him.\n\nVance says Walz pick as running mate 'highlights how radical' Harris is\n\nIn his first public comments since his general election foe was set, JD Vance on Tuesday called Walz a choice that \"highlights how radical Kamala Harris is.\"\n\nIn a gaggle with reporters aboard his campaign plane upon landing in Philadelphia, Vance said Walz \"is a person who listens to the Hamas wing\" of the Democratic Party and \"who wants to make the American people more reliant on garbage energy instead of good American energy.\"\n\nVance is speaking more to reporters in Philadelphia on Tuesday ahead of campaign events across Midwestern battleground states on Wednesday, in a path that somewhat mirrors Harris and Walz's planned trajectory.\n\nFormer colleagues on Capitol Hill appear thrilled with Walz as the VP pick\n\n\"Great choice,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\n\"Having served for years with Tim in the House of Representatives, I can say without reservation: there's no better person Vice President Harris could have picked to run and then govern alongside her,\" said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md.\n\nWalz \"has always put our country first,\" Van Hollen said, and he's excited to campaign for the Harris-Walz ticket for \"a brighter future for all Americans.\"\n\nRep. Mark Takano of California recalled how after Walz beat him during an internal House caucus vote to become the top Democrat on the Veterans Affairs Committee, his colleague \"immediately brought me into the fold because that's the type of leader he is: a collaborative bridge builder.\"\n\nAnd Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, who entered Congress with Walz in 2007, said he \"has always had this very straightforward, direct, open approach to things.\"\n\nWelch described Walz as \"one of these guys in the gym who wouldn't undo his tie\" because it would be faster for him to get back to work.\n\nPolling shows the appeal of Tim Walz's biography\n\nTim Walz's biography as a military veteran and former high school teacher - two broadly trusted professions - may also help him appeal to Americans as he campaigns with Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAbout 9 in 10 U.S. adults say they have a favorable opinion of military veterans, generally, according to an Ipsos poll conducted in 2024. About 8 in 10 say that about school teachers. Both measures are much higher than for government employees or elected officials. Republicans are slightly more likely than Democrats to have a positive view of veterans, while Democrats are a bit more likely to have a favorable opinion of those in a teaching career.\n\nGallup polling from 2022 found that high school teachers are generally held in high regard among Americans for their honesty and ethical standards. About half, 53%, gave them at least a high rating on ethics.\n\nAP VoteCast shows Tim Walz's electoral strengths and weakness in Minnesota\n\nDemocratic nominee Kamala Harris is hoping her VP choice, Tim Walz, will strengthen the Democratic ticket in Midwestern states and among working class voters.\n\nAP VoteCast shows that when Walz was elected Minnesota governor in 2022, he won young voters in the state. He also did well in Minnesota's union households, winning nearly 6 in 10 voters in that group. About half of Minnesota voters, 52%, had a favorable view of Walz, and about 4 in 10 had a negative one.\n\nAnd while Walz lost white voters without a college education in the state, he outperformed Democrats nationwide with this group. He also struggled among white men, a demographic Democrats have sought to win back from President Donald Trump, but did a little better among this group than Democrats nationwide.\n\nHowever, Walz lost among military veteran households in Minnesota in 2022, according to VoteCast.\n\nTim Walz will need to introduce himself to America\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz will need to introduce himself to the vast majority of Americans.\n\nAn ABC News/Ipsos survey conducted before Walz was selected as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, but after vetting began, showed that nearly 9 in 10 U.S. adults did not know enough to have an opinion about him. Among Americans with a view, opinions were split between positive and negative: 6% had a favorable view, and 7% had an unfavorable one.\n\nWalz's lack of a national profile as he joins Harris on the campaign trail extends to his own party. Nearly 9 in 10 Democrats also didn't know enough to have an opinion of Walz in the ABC News/Ipsos poll. One in 10 had a favorable view of him, and just 4% had a negative opinion. He was an unknown figure among most Democrats across the party: those older and younger were similarly likely to not know Walz, as well as white Democrats and non-white Democrats.\n\nFellow Minnesotan Sen. Amy Klobuchar says Walz is 'just unendingly optimistic and joyous'\n\nU.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar says Walz is someone who is \"just unendingly optimistic and joyous, and that is very, very important right now in our politics.\"\n\nThe fellow Minnesotan who served with Walz in Congress told The Associated Press \"he's blunt, but he's also positive\" in a way she believes will provide an upbeat message in contrast to the Trump-Vance Republican ticket.\n\n\"I always think of him in his plaid shirt because he was always making the point it's 'One Minnesota,'\" said Klobuchar, a Democrat. \"And I think that's a point you're going hear him talk about with our nation.\"\n\nShe said his background as a hunter and someone who fishes \"just brings a different perspective to the White House.\"\n\nSeveral black and white SUVs have left the Governor's residence in St. Paul\n\nThe SUVs left amid cheers from residents lined up on the sidewalk.\n\nHarris' running mate pick is good news for man who owns rights to HarrisWalz.com\n\nJeremy Green Eche was in the middle of getting his toddler dressed the moment news broke that Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris had selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate.\n\nAnd he was amped.\n\nEche was uniquely invested in Harris' pick. He currently owns the rights to HarrisWalz.com, a site he bought in 2020 -- along with a slate of other Harris sites -- when the would-be vice president was in the midst of a primary campaign for president. Four years and one vice presidential pick later, Eche is willing to sell the slate of Harris websites, including the one featuring Walz, for $15,000.\n\n\"I was constantly refreshing four different news sites on my phone,\" he told The Associated Press on Tuesday. \"I was very excited.\" He said he \"almost immediately\" began getting calls from both journalists and \"friends I hadn't heard from in a while.\"\n\nThis is not a new scenario for the 36-year-old trademark lawyer in Brooklyn, New York. Eche is a cyber squatter, someone who buys a domain with someone else's name or brand in it for very little money, hoping to sell it to that person or brand for a large profit in the subsequent months or years. In 2011, when it looked likely that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would be the Democratic nominee in 2016, then Jeremy Peter Green - he took his wife's last name - purchased ClintonKaine.com.\n\nAfter the former secretary of state picked Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, the squatter offered it to the campaign for a hefty return. They declined, so he sold it for $15,000 to a digital marketing company that turned out to be the Trump campaign. The website pushed anti-Clinton news with \"Paid for by Donald J. Trump for President, Inc\" emblazoned at the bottom.\n\nEche supported Clinton in 2016 and supports Harris today. The prospect of something like that happening again doesn't give Eche pause, however.\n\n\"The Harris campaign has hundreds of millions of dollars, so if they don't buy their own domain, that is kind of on them,\" he said Monday. But he isn't convinced they will buy the domain.\n\n\"I don't want to be too confident that somebody will reach out,\" he said after Walz was selected. \"I would say there's a 75% chance that one of the campaigns, or a PAC, will buy it from me.\"\n\nWalz says he's 'all in'\n\nIn a Tuesday morning post on X, Walz said joining the ticket with Harris is \"the honor of a lifetime.\"\n\nHis profile details on X are now \"Running to win this thing with @kamalaharris.\"\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro on Walz\n\nShapiro called Walz \"an exceptionally strong addition to the ticket\" who'll help Harris become the 47th president.\n\nShapiro, who met with Harris on Sunday about the job, said he was grateful to talk about \"her vision for the role and the campaign ahead.\"\n\n\"As I've said repeatedly over the past several weeks, the running mate decision was a deeply personal decision for the vice president - and it was also a deeply personal decision for me. Pennsylvanians elected me to a four-year term as their governor, and my work here is far from finished - there is a lot more stuff I want to get done for the good people of this commonwealth,\" Shapiro said in a statement.\n\nHe said he considers Walz a good friend and pledged to travel the state over the next three months to help Democrats defeat former President Donald Trump \"and build a better future for our country.\"\n\n\"Vice President Kamala Harris has my enthusiastic support - and I know that Governor Tim Walz is an exceptionally strong addition to the ticket who will help Kamala move our country forward,\" Shapiro said.\n\nAt the Governor's mansion, a Minnesota resident says why he likes Walz\n\nDavid Ivory, 46, stood outside the Governor's mansion with his two children. Ivory found out Walz was selected after his wife texted him \"OMG\" from work.\n\nHe and his kids immediately hopped on their bikes and rode to the Governor's residence in St. Paul.\n\nIvory and his family are longtime admirers of Walz for his liberal record and amiable political persona.\n\n\"He's just down to earth. He gets it. He can talk to anybody,\" Ivory said. \"He doesn't seem like he's above anybody. He was a teacher. He understands kids, which is very important.\"\n\nHarris says her new running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has 'delivered for working families'\n\n\"It's great to have him on the team,\" Harris said.\n\nHarris posted on X that she was proud to announce she asked Walz to join her on the 2024 ticket.\n\nVoter Coalition Pushes Issue-Based Outreach Strategy to Increase Registration, Shifting from Top of Ticket Politics\n\nState Voices launched a $3 million nationwide campaign Tuesday to encourage voters of color to vote based on the issues that affect their day-to-day lives, like grocery price spikes or growing rent and mortgage payments.\n\nUnder the Vote for Something campaign, the coalition aims to register 800,000 voters, make more than 250 million voter contacts, and encourage 100,000 people to make a plan to vote on or ahead of the 2024 election for themselves and others.\n\nThey've registered more than 400,000 voters so far.\n\nState Voices, like many voting rights advocates, hopes for messaging that transcends the top of the ticket -- a looming match between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\"Whatever the issue is that matters to you, vote for something. Get out this November and bring a friend and a family member with you,\" said Mishara Davis, the group's director of issue and electoral organizing.\n\nThe key has been reaching voters who may be tired of the political space altogether or who are eligible to vote but aren't registered and therefore may not receive voting information -- especially in presidential swing states, Georgia, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, which are primary areas under the campaign.\n\nThis comes as Harris, who is in Pennsylvania this week, has chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, sources say. The pair will continue the campaign tour to Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada starting Wednesday.\n\nEnvironmental group cheers selection of Walz as the Democratic vice presidential candidate\n\nManish Bapna, president and CEO of the NRDC Action Fund, the political arm of the Natural Resources Defense Council, called Harris and Walz \"the winning ticket on climate. The Harris-Walz administration will be ready, on day one, to build on the strongest climate action ever and lead by example in the global fight against the existential challenge of our time.''\n\nWalz has made Minnesota a national climate leader, Bapna said. Under his leadership, the state committed to 100% clean energy by 2040, and Minnesota was the first Midwestern state to adopt California's strict tailpipe emissions standards. Walz also signed a bill last year directing $240 million to replace lead service water lines statewide.\n\n\"The stakes in this election couldn't be higher nor the choice more clear. Trump would bow to billionaire oil and gas donors, slam climate progress into reverse and leave our kids to pay the price. Harris is a proven climate and justice leader with two decades of public service on the front lines of needed progress and change. She's shown us what leadership looks like, and she's earned the chance to lead,\" Bapna said.\n\nThe National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund praises Walz's selection\n\n\"The National LGBTQ Action Fund expected a strategic and bold choice as a strong addition to the ticket as a Vice-Presidential candidate,\" Sayre E. Reece, vice president of the National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, said Tuesday in a statement. \"In Governor Walz we have gotten both.\"\n\nReece continued: \"Governor Walz has been a steadfast ally and advocate for the LGBTQ community, including support for trans affirming care, bodily autonomy and reproductive freedom and gun control. As Governor, Walz signed a ban on so-called 'conversion therapy' into law, ending the harmful and cruel practice that has cost LGBTQ people their dignity and their lives. Under Walz's leadership, Minnesota is both a 'trans sanctuary' and immigration sanctuary state.\"\n\nThe National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund describes itself as lobbying for legislation and ballot initiatives that \"achieve justice\" for LGBTQ people.\n\nAt Walz's residence in Minnesota\n\nA growing crowd of residents and news reporters gathered outside Walz's residence in St. Paul, Minnesota, on Tuesday morning.\n\nBlack and white SUVs periodically pulled into the driveway as onlookers waited to catch a glimpse of Walz leaving the 20-room governor's mansion near the Mississippi River.\n\nNo immediate comment from Vance on Harris picking Walz as her running mate\n\nBoarding his campaign plane Tuesday morning in Cincinnati for a swing through battleground states this week, Ohio Sen. JD Vance did not answer shouted questions about Harris picking Walz as her running mate.\n\nOn Tuesday, Vance was heading to Pennsylvania, where Harris planned to debut with her new running mate later in the day.\n\nTrump attacks Walz in a fundraising email\n\nDonald Trump sent a fundraising email calling Walz \"Dangerously Liberal\" and saying he would \"unleash HELL ON EARTH.\"\n\nMoments after Harris' VP pick became public, the former president and Republican nominee said Walz would be the worst vice president in history, claiming the Minnesota governor would \"light TRILLIONS of dollars on fire\" and open U.S. borders to criminals.\n\n\"HE'S THAT BAD,\" the email says.\n\nThe selection process that led Harris to pick Walz as her running mate\n\nA team of lawyers and political operatives led by former attorney general Eric Holder pored over documents and conducted interviews with potential vice presidential selections.\n\nAnd Harris herself met with her three finalists on Sunday. She mulled the decision over Monday with top aides at the vice president's residence in Washington and finalized it Tuesday morning.\n\nWalz emerged as the choice.\n\nA Minnesota Democratic strategist praises Walz's ability to connect with voters\n\nMinnesota Democratic strategist Abu Amara says Walz will be a good surrogate for Harris across the upper Midwest, because he represented a rural U.S. House district but won statewide in a state with large metropolitan and suburban areas.\n\n\"He's not trying to speak in poetry. He speaks in practicality,\" Amara said. \"That's a level of accessibility for so many voters.\"\n\n\"He has the ability to connect with rural, suburban and urban voters,\" he said.\n\nSome Republicans are already reacting to the selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as Harris' VP pick\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis called it the \"most left-wing ticket in American history\" and accused Walz of not doing enough to protect Minnesota during the 2020 protests over the killing of George Floyd.\n\nHe said \"Walz sat by and let Minneapolis burn.\"\n\nTropical Storm Debby continues to upend Harris' travel plans this week\n\nThe campaign had already pulled down a planned stop in Savannah, Georgia, because of the weather.\n\nBut the Democratic presidential nominee will now no longer travel to Raleigh, North Carolina, either, according to the campaign. She was set to travel to Raleigh on Thursday.\n\nHarris is launching a tour of battleground states on Tuesday evening, starting in Philadelphia.\n\nHarris picks Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as running mate, AP sources say\n\nVice President Kamala Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday. That's according to three people who spoke to The Associated Press.\n\nIn choosing Walz, she's turning to a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families. The people were not authorized to speak publicly about the choice and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.\n\n-- Seung Min Kim, Zeke Miller and Colleen Long\n\nSources say Harris has decided on a running mate\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has decided on a running mate and an announcement is expected in the coming hours before the two appear together at a Philadelphia rally, according to three people familiar with her decision.\n\nIn recent days, she has zeroed in on a trio of potential finalists: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. It wasn't clear yet who she picked.\n\nThe people were familiar with her plans but spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that had not been publicly announced.\n\nHarris' campaign planned to make the announcement via video message before the rally, though the exact timing remained unclear, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail discussions occurring behind closed doors.\n\n-- Seung Min Kim, Zeke Miller and Colleen Long\n\nHarris formally secures the Democratic presidential nomination\n\nVice President Kamala Harris formally secured the Democratic presidential nomination late Monday -- becoming the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket.\n\nHarris' nomination became official after a five-day round of online balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates ended Monday night, with the party saying in a statement released just before midnight that 99% of delegates casting ballots had done so for Harris. It said it would next formally certify the vote before holding a celebratory roll call at the party's convention later this month in Chicago.\n\nHarris' coronation as her party's standard-bearer caps a tumultuous and frenetic period for Democrats prompted by President Joe Biden's disastrous June debate performance.\n\nAs soon as Biden abruptly ended his candidacy, Harris and her team worked rapidly to secure backing from the 1,976 party delegates needed to clinch the nomination in a formal roll call vote. She reached that marker at warp speed, with an Associated Press survey of delegates nationwide showing she locked down the necessary commitments a mere 32 hours after Biden's announcement.\n\nFOX28 Spokane©"],"source":{"uri":["fox28spokane.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["FOX 28 Spokane"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://www.fox28spokane.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Featured-Image-Fallback-National-News-28.jpg"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.051],"wgt":[460679387],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["2024-08-446222721"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-06"],"time":["22:29:45"],"dateTime":["2024-08-06T22:29:45Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-06T21:49:42Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.timesunion.com/news/politics/article/fact-focus-false-claims-follow-minnesota-19624193.php"],"title":["FACT FOCUS: False claims follow Minnesota governor's selection as Harris' running mate"],"body":["Vice President Kamala Harris' announcement on Tuesday that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will be her running mate in the 2024 presidential election increased the spread of false claims about the Midwestern Democrat, some of which appeared on social media even before Harris made her pick public.\n\nCLAIM: Walz said on CNN that he wants to invest in a \"ladder factory\" to help people scale the wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and illegally enter the U.S.\n\nTHE FACTS: That's false. Posts are misrepresenting a comment Walz made on an episode of CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360\" last week. In the full segment, the Democrat criticizes former President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall on the southern border by joking about the hypothetical investment.

In a post to X, formerly Twitter, Harris said in part, \"As a governor, a coach, a teacher, and a veteran, he's delivered for working families like his. It's great to have him on the team. Now let's get to work.\"\n\nTrump's campaign also commented on Harris' pick of Walz on Tuesday, saying in part, \"It's no surprise that San Francisco Liberal Kamala Harris wants West Coast wannabe Tim Walz as her running-mate - Walz has spent his governorship trying to reshape Minnesota in the image of the Golden State.\"\n\nOn Truth Social, Trump also called out the Harris-Walz ticket: \"This is the most Radical Left duo in American history. There has never been anything like it, and there never will be again.\"\n\nPolitical analyst Craig Agranoff told Newsweek on Tuesday that Trump's comments show that \"it's clear that political rhetoric intensifies as we approach the election season.\"\n\n\"While it's uncertain whether President Biden is reconsidering his nomination, it's important to recognize these statements as part of a broader strategy to energize their respective bases,\" Argranoff added.\n\nWhen asked about Trump's insult of Harris and Walz, Agranoff said, \"As for labeling the Harris-Walz ticket as the 'most radical left duo in American history,' it's a subjective characterization intended to appeal to certain voter segments. Ultimately, the American people will make their judgments based on policies and performance rather than partisan labels.\""],"source":{"uri":["newsweek.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Newsweek"]},"authors":[{"uri":["anna_commander@newsweek.com"],"name":["Anna Commander"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2444417/joe-biden-kamala-harris.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=49c166d848d599c12a4d8f409bf1a7d6"],"eventUri":["eng-9796268"],"sentiment":[-0.0824],"wgt":[460679349],"relevance":[1]}],"totalResults":[9305],"page":[1],"count":[100],"pages":[94]}
