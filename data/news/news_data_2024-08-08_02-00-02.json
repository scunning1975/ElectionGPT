The interview is the Biden's first sit-down since he announced he was quitting the 2024 race on July 21.\n\n\"If Trump loses I'm not confident at all,\" Biden told political correspondent Robert Costa, while referring comments made by the former president at a campaign rally in Ohio in March. \"He means what he says, we don't take him seriously. He means it -- all that stuff about 'if we lose, it will be a bloodbath.'\"\n\nLara Trump, co-chair of the Republican National Committee who is married to Donald's third child, Eric, appeared on NewsNation Wednesday night to assuage those fears.\n\n\"We believe if every legal vote is counted, come November 5, Donald Trump will be president. There will be no problem,\" she told host Christopher Cuomo on Cuomo.\n\n\"It is my job to make sure that people who are voting for Trump feel like their vote matters. And I can assure you, if he does not legally and legitimately win this election, there will be no problem.\"\n\nIn May, Lara declared on Newsmax that the former president had accepted the 2020 election results, claiming it was, \"It's pretty obvious...even despite the fact that it was a very questionable election in 2020.\"\n\nThe comments were met with criticism by DNC Rapid Response Director Alex Floyd at the time, who said in a statement, \"The American people are not falling for Lara Trump's sad and desperate attempts to whitewash Donald Trump's election denialism as he actively continues to push baseless lies about his loss by over 7 million votes in the 2020 election while refusing to commit to accepting this November's results.

He is publisher of the Latino News Network and a trainer with the Solutions Journalism Network.\n\nThe 2024 presidential election poses a unique set of challenges and opportunities for journalists tasked with covering it. Today's audiences expect more from the media than just traditional \"who is leading in the polls\" reporting and problem-focused coverage. They are calling for a shift towards highlighting responses that address community challenges.\n\nPeople across the country are feeling frustrated and disillusioned with U.S. politics and the journalism that reports on it. While coverage often focuses on extremes, poll numbers, accusations and sensational statements, research shows that this approach falls short of meeting the public's needs. What people truly desire is news that helps them comprehend and navigate the complexities of the world around them.\n\nWhile many newsrooms extensively cover politics, there is a lack of focus on democracy itself -- the electoral and governmental systems that shape our nation. So, how can we meet this demand, especially during an election year? The answer lies in embracing solutions journalism.\n\nThe concept of solutions journalism aims to foster an environment that tackles the challenges faced by our democracy by promoting civic engagement, equity and constructive discourse. By shifting the focus from merely reporting on problems to highlighting responses (to those problems), journalists can contribute to a more informed and empowered citizenry.\n\nEarlier this year, I was a guest speaker at the \"Putting the Public First in Political Coverage\" webinar organized by the Journalism Courses program at the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas.\n\n\"The usual focus on winners and losers leaves us asking, 'What about the people?'\" Camila Llorente, online course associate with the Knight Center, wrote in her description of the program. \"More and more journalists and scholars believe that it's time for a change, a move towards a more inclusive journalism that puts communities first.\"\n\n\"There IS an alternative to the traditional horse-race election coverage with its focus on polls and public perception. One that builds public trust, reduces polarization, and helps communities solve problems,\" said Jaisal Noor, Democracy Initiative manager at the Solutions Journalism Network. Noor proposes that a solutions journalism approach \"works toward building trust, strengthening democracy, and providing voters with meaningful information -- while still holding politicians to account.\"\n\nAmid the whirlwind of political journalism, it is common to become engrossed in the \"horse race\" aspect -- the polls, forecasts and political spectacles that grab the spotlight. Yet, at the core of our democracy lie fundamental issues such as protecting voting rights and guaranteeing equitable access to the democratic system. Journalists are tasked with not only highlighting instances where civil liberties are under threat but also showcasing individuals and organizations that are actively working towards solutions to these challenges and elucidating the processes driving change.\n\nAs part of the Solutions Journalism Network's fall 2023 seminar series on covering democracy, a number of leading journalists were asked to address the challenges and opportunities in stepping away from the horse race and dedicating more resources to covering democracy. \"Elevating Democracy Reporting: A Guide to Journalists\" offered tips on everything from the need to understand the intricacies of election administration to humanizing coverage and examining progress as well as problems.\n\nIt is essential that people who will be affected by a policy change be heard. \"It really frustrates me when I hear these elite political journalists in places like New York and Washington say, 'Oh, well, this or that law is not going to have any impact,'\" Ari Berman, national voting rights correspondent for Mother Jones, said. \"Well, how do they know? Have they interviewed people that have waited for 10 hours to vote? Have they interviewed people that can't get an ID or have problems with an ID for some reason or another? Have they interviewed people that have been purged from the rolls? Have they interviewed people who have had their polling places shut? Have they interviewed people who can only get to the polls on the weekends because they work during the week? I mean, there are so many things that go into whether or not someone could or could not be able to vote.\"\n\nAnother person advised including marginalized communities in coverage. Natalia Contreras, a reporter for Votebeat Texas, recommended delving into the experience of voters who have disabilities or don't speak English. \"If we know that we have a large multi-language community ... do we know whether our counties are translating instructions into other languages?\" she asked. \"What is the law about that? Maybe we need to bring that to the forefront if that hasn't been the case.\"\n\nIn the United States, a rich history of inaccessibility and general distrust between communities of color and governmental systems has led to exclusive representation and participation within democratic processes.\n\nBoth theLatino News Network and The Fulcrum are focused on covering what is most important to our democracy -- not the accusations, innuendos and misinformation that all too often form the politics of our nation.\n\nIn my new role as director of solutions journalism & DEI initiatives at The Fulcrum, I will be committed to actively listening and building trust with the diverse communities we serve so we can provide relevant, accurate, nonpartisan and in-depth coverage year-round that civically informs and motivates underrepresented and underserved residents.\n\nThe Fulcrum's newsroom sees these communities as more than just our audience; they are our collaborators. Community insight and feedback continually shape our work.\n\nCollaboration is integral to the health of news and the health of democracy."],"source":{"uri":["thefulcrum.us"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["The Fulcrum"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://thefulcrum.us/media-library/rows-of-newspapers.jpg?id=53104784&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C536%2C0%2C536"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.0196],"wgt":[460789913],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8264608333"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-08"],"time":["05:05:49"],"dateTime":["2024-08-08T05:05:49Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-08T05:03:24Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.698],"url":["https://cryptorank.io/news/feed/258d6-kamala-harris-and-donald-trump-tied-at-49-odds-in-polymarket.htm"],"title":["Kamala Harris and Donald Trump Tied at 49% Odds on Polymarket | Blockchain Donald Trump | CryptoRank.io"],"body":["Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are now deadlocked at 49% odds on Polymarket as bettors try to forecast the next U.S. president.\n\nThe race represents the largest betting pool on the crypto prediction platform, with over $541 million at stake.\n\nThe development follows Harris's announcement of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate, a choice that surprised many Polymarket users who had expected Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.\n\nAs of the latest, both Harris and Walz, along with Trump and his running mate, J.D.

He's a small-town boy who grew up working on a farm. A patriot who joined the National Guard and served for 20 years. A high school social studies teacher. A high school football coach. A veteran. A hunter, a gun owner, and a skilled marksman. A midwesterner who knows rural America. He's the type of man Republicans claim to love, but unlike the men who lead today's Republican Party, Walz has a heart.\n\nWalz is pro-union, supports a strong minimum wage, and voted for President Obama's Affordable Care Act when he served in Congress. And unlike the coach stereotype, he had the courage to serve as the faculty adviser for the student LGBTQ group on campus. He's funny on the stump, but he's a great attack dog. And he means business. Walz appointed Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to prosecute Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer who murdered George Floyd. But even though progressives love him, he doesn't come across as threatening to middle America.\n\n\"And in 91 days,\" as Harris said today, \"the nation will know Coach Walz by another name: Vice President of the United States.\"\n\nAs soon as Walz was announced, independent progressive Bernie Sanders endorsed him on the left, and conservative Joe Manchin endorsed him on the right. Do you know how hard that is to get those two to agree on anything? That's like a Nobel Peace Prize in Democratic politics. Heck, even AOC endorsed him.\n\nWalz helps heal the party and avoids a big conflict at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago over Gaza. He keeps the momentum going for Harris, and he matches her joyful energy.\n\nRELATED: 10 Big Lies Trump and the Republicans Tell About Kamala Harris\n\nBut isn't he another old white guy? Um, hello. Tim Walz, Kamala Harris, and I are all about the same age. We were born 16 months apart. And all of us are younger than Barack Obama. So, in my biased opinion, he's still a young guy. Yes, he looks a lot older than Kamala and me, but we all know black don't crack.\n\nAnd actually, his avuncular appearance and relatable life story make him much more appealing to the voters Harris needs to win the battleground states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. Comparing JD Vance to Walz is like a \"matchup between the varsity team and the JV squad,\" Harris said today.\n\nI know some people wanted other candidates, and they all had different assets. Mark Kelly is an astronaut. Pete Buttigieg is a great communicator. Josh Shapiro is hugely popular in the critical state of Pennsylvania. And originally, I wanted Andy Beshear, the youthful governor of Kentucky.\n\nBut in the past few weeks of watching him campaign for Harris, Walz won me over. \"You've legalized recreational marijuana, passed universal background checks for guns, expanded LGBTQ protections, implemented tuition-free college for low-income residents, and given out free breakfast and lunch for school kids, Jake Tapper said to him in a recent CNN interview.\n\nRELATED: If Trump Wins, Republican Judges Will Rule the Courts -- and Our Lives\n\nWalz didn't skip a beat. \"What a monster,\" he said. Kids have full bellies so they can learn. He didn't shy away from his record. He firmly defended it.\n\nRepublicans are already trying to sow division in the party by claiming that Harris didn't pick Shapiro because he's Jewish and claiming, \"No Jews allowed at the top of the Democratic Party.\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer quickly put that argument to rest, but the nerve of the straight, Christian, white male-dominated Republican Party to complain about diversity in the Democratic Party. Give me a break.\n\nDemocrats nominated the first woman for vice president in 1984 (Geraldine Ferraro, the first Jewish candidate for vice president in 2000 (Joe Lieberman), the first Black president in 2008 (Barack Obama), the first woman candidate for president in 2016 (Hillary Clinton), and now the first Black woman and first South Asian woman for president in 2024 (Kamala Harris). Meanwhile, Republicans have given us nothing but white men on the ticket for the past four elections.\n\nThat's why I like Walz. He balances the ticket, and his energy matches Kamala's. Other candidates are good on the attack, but Walz does the same with a smile. And when they join forces, they make a great team.

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are the front-runners. Delving deeply into both candidates reveals substantial weaknesses that complicate their qualifications. Kamala Harris is considered the first Black and South Asian female nominated for the highest political position in the United States. However, she arguably lacks political experience, particularly in foreign policy. Thus, this inexperience could be a significant liability in an era of global uncertainty. Since assuming the role of vice president, Harris has struggled to define her role and make a substantial impact on major policy areas. As a vice president, her handling of critical issues, such as the border crisis and diplomatic engagements, has been disappointing. This failure to effectively address such issues adds to the narrative that she may not be prepared for the full responsibilities of the presidency. In addition to that, Harris's considerable inability to build a solid public profile is another concern. As such, many Americans remain uncertain of her leadership capabilities. The question arises: Can Kamala Harris effectively lead the nation and navigate the complexities of international relations in a time of global instability?\n\nTo answer this question, we need to explore the character of Kamala, who is clinging to the presidency, much like Trump, who does not understand the international system and foreign policy laws properly. While historic milestones have marked her political career, it has yet to demonstrate the necessary depth of experience and strategic vision for the presidency. As the world grapples with escalating geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Middle East, economic uncertainties, and a rapidly changing climate, the next president must possess the ability to respond to prevent them. Kamala may need a decade, or perhaps more, to master the art of foreign policy. Therefore, the answer here is hard to interpret, even when considered from another perspective.\n\nConversely, Trump is a polarizing and controversial figure and may even be a cause for concern. Trump's management style is erratic and impulsive, leading to unpredictable policy changes that can destabilize both domestic and international arenas. An excellent example is his first tenure, characterized by significant controversy, contentious foreign policies, and an impeachment trial. Additionally, he adopted an unorthodox style and approach in navigating relationships with allies and adversaries and addressing critical global issues. His foreign policy decisions often prioritized short-term gains over long-term stability and alliances. On the same boat, his frequent clashes with the media and political establishments are another significant concern. Such approach and behavior have left divided. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that Trump will follow the same approach that previously led to the tumultuous and chaotic atmosphere. His return to the White House could further erode democratic norms and institutions.\n\nAlthough Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are prominent figures in the upcoming election, their candidacies bring to light significant issues regarding experience, divisiveness, and the need for new leadership. As such, arguably, looking deeply into American political history, the current scenario underscores that America's democratic process is at a critical juncture. Voter dissatisfaction with the top candidates signals a broader need for systemic change within the political arena. However, although the timing of upcoming American elections is imminent, the Democratic and Republican parties still need to nurture a new generation of leaders who embody integrity, competence, and a genuine commitment to public service for the next decade, regardless of which candidate wins. Additionally, both parties must engage in introspection and reform to restore trust with the American public. The growth of extreme partisanship and the erosion of civil discourse have obstructed effective policymaking. The route to a healthier democracy lies in collaboration, transparency, and a renewed commitment to the common good. Realizing this vision requires political will and active engagement from citizens who demand accountability and ethical behavior from their representatives. In sum, America stands at a crossroads, and the decisions made in the coming years will determine the nation's trajectory for a decade. It is possible to overcome the nation's challenges with sustained effort and dedication. Thus, both parties must step up, offering candidates in the future who can lead and inspire confidence in American citizens. The future of American democracy hinges on embracing these ideals, guaranteeing the nation thrives through collective effort and principled leadership. Only then will the U.S. be able to reach its full potential as it befits its reputation as a superpower."],"source":{"uri":["moderndiplomacy.eu"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Modern Diplomacy"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://moderndiplomacy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/kamala-trump.jpg"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[-0.0902],"wgt":[460785969],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8264544585"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-08"],"time":["04:01:15"],"dateTime":["2024-08-08T04:01:15Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-08T04:00:49Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.adaderana.lk/news/101073/2024-presidential-election-22-candidates-place-deposits-so-far"],"title":["2024 Presidential Election: 22 candidates place deposits so far"],"body":["The number of candidates who have placed deposits thus far in order to contest the 2024 Presidential Election has increased to 22.\n\nAccordingly, the Election Commission stated that 11 recognized political parties have deposited bonds with the Election Commission thus far.\n\nThe Election Commission announced that the deposit money for the 2024 Presidential Election can be deposited until 12 noon on August 14, the day before the calling of nominations for the election.\n\nThe Election Commission of Sri Lanka had issued a Gazette on July 26 declaring that the 2024 Presidential Election will be held on the 21st September 2024 and that nominations will be accepted on 15 August 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, Ven.

Credit: The White House, CC BY 3.0 US , via Wikimedia Commons\n\nPresident Joe Biden has raised concerns over the possibility of a peaceful transfer of power should former President Donald Trump secure a victory in the 2024 presidential election. In a recent interview, Biden expressed a lack of confidence in such a scenario, sparking widespread discussions and debates across social media platforms.\n\nThe president's comments, which have been widely shared and discussed online, have led to various interpretations. Some users question the implications of his words, and others express concern about the potential for violence or unrest following the election. The remarks come amid heightened political tensions and ongoing debates about the integrity of the electoral process.\n\nThe issue of a peaceful transition of power has become increasingly significant in recent years. The events of January 6, 2021, served as a stark reminder of the potential for political unrest following a contentious election. Biden's comments have reignited concerns about the stability of the democratic process and the potential for further political violence.\n\nThe president's remarks also highlight the ongoing political divide in the United States, with supporters of both Biden and Trump interpreting his words in the context of their respective political ideologies. Some have criticized Biden for lacking confidence, arguing that it undermines the democratic process. In contrast, others have praised him for his honesty and for acknowledging the potential challenges that may arise following the election.\n\nThe 2024 presidential election is shaping up to be a highly contentious race. Both Biden and Trump are expected to be frontrunners for their respective parties. The outcome of the election is likely to have significant implications for the country's future, with both candidates offering vastly different visions for the United States.\n\nAs the election approaches, it remains to be seen how Biden's comments will impact the political landscape and whether they will influence the race's outcome. In the meantime, the president's remarks have served as a reminder of the importance of a peaceful transition of power and the need for a robust and secure electoral process."],"source":{"uri":["econotimes.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["EconoTimes"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://f1.econotimes.com/2024/08/zts6me03w3_th_1024x0.jpg"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.1765],"wgt":[460785028],"relevance":[13]},{"uri":["8264530758"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-08"],"time":["03:45:29"],"dateTime":["2024-08-08T03:45:29Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-08T03:44:43Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=101073"],"title":["2024 Presidential Election: 22 candidates place deposits so far"],"body":["The number of candidates who have placed deposits thus far in order to contest the 2024 Presidential Election has increased to 22.\n\nAccordingly, the Election Commission stated that 11 recognized political parties have deposited bonds with the Election Commission thus far.\n\nThe Election Commission announced that the deposit money for the 2024 Presidential Election can be deposited until 12 noon on August 14, the day before the calling of nominations for the election.\n\nThe Election Commission of Sri Lanka had issued a Gazette on July 26 declaring that the 2024 Presidential Election will be held on the 21st September 2024 and that nominations will be accepted on 15 August 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, Ven.

He sows chaos and division amongst the people.

He has no understanding of service. Because he's too busy serving himself again and again and again.\"\n\n\"This guy weakens our country to strengthen his own hands. He mocks our laws. He sows chaos and division amongst the people. And that's to say nothing of the job he did as president,\" Walz argued.\n\nHours earlier, Trump - in an interview on \"Fox and Friends\" - belittled the naming to the Democrats' ticket of Walz, a former high school teacher and football coach turned Democratic congressman in a red district before winning election and re-election as governor.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT HARRIS NAMES MINNESOTA GOV TIM WALZ AS HER RUNNING MATE\n\n\"I could not be more thrilled,\" Trump said when asked about the announcement from Harris on Tuesday that she chose Walz as her running mate, after also seriously considering Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona.\n\n\"I was shocked when, when it came down to the final two, that she didn't pick Shapiro. I was very surprised,\" Trump said.\n\nBut the naming of a running mate has been lucrative for the Harris campaign, which highlighted that it had hauled in $36 million in fundraising in the 24 hours since the Walz announcement.\n\nAt the rally, which the Harris campaign said attracted a crowd of over 12,000 people to a festival field amid farmland outside this small northwest Wisconsin city, Walz once again argued that Trump and Vance \"are creepy and weird as hell.\"\n\nVance, at a campaign event miles away, pushed back on the \"weird\" label, saying that he and Trump are \"normal guys who want to make this country great.\"\n\nIn a viral moment, Vance appeared to try and troll the vice president, as he approached Air Force Two at Chippewa Valley Regional Airport, where the senator's campaign plane was also parked.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I figured that I would come by and get a good look at the plane because hopefully it's going to be my plane in a few months,\" Vance said in front of Air Force Two.\n\nAnd once again pointing out that Harris has yet to sit for a major interview or hold a press conference in the two and a half weeks since she replaced President Biden at the top of the Democrats' national ticket, Vance told reporters \"I also thought you guys may get lonely, because the VP doesn't answer questions from reporters.\"\n\nBiden dropped his re-election bid on July 21, after a disastrous debate performance against Trump in late June prompted increased questions over whether the 81-year-old president had the physical and mental abilities to serve another four years in the White House. It also sparked a rising chorus of calls from fellow Democrats for Biden to end his re-election bid.\n\nHarris didn't mention her boss at a large rally in Atlanta last week, nor did she or Walz reference the president at their rally Tuesday night in Philadelphia.\n\nBut Harris, in her sixth visit to Wisconsin so far this year, praised the president at the top of her comments.\n\n\"I want to bring greetings from our incredible president, Joe Biden,\" Harris said. \"He loves Wisconsin, and I know we are all deeply grateful for his lifetime of service to our nation and for all he continues to do.\"\n\nAfter the crowd broke out in a chant of \"Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe!,\" the vice president responded \"that's right. I'm gonna tell him what you said.\""],"source":{"uri":["1010wcsi.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["1010 WCSI"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://1010wcsi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/WCSI-header.png"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.0902],"wgt":[460784051],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8264516290"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-08"],"time":["03:28:15"],"dateTime":["2024-08-08T03:28:15Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-08T03:27:49Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.onlanka.com/news/justice-ministry-brought-under-sri-lankan-presidents-purview.html"],"title":["Justice Ministry brought under Sri Lankan President's purview - Sri Lanka"],"body":["The Ministerial portfolios of Justice, Prison Affairs, and Constitutional Reforms have been brought under the purview of Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe through a Gazette Extraordinary issued by the President.\n\nThe Gazette Notification, issued today (August 07) by the Secretary to the President, Saman Ekanayake, by order of the President, stated that it was issued after consulting with the Prime Minister under Article 44 (3) of the Constitution.\n\nThis move follows the recent resignation of Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe from his ministerial portfolios to contest the upcoming Presidential election.\n\nOn July 25, MP Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe officially announced that he would contest the 2024 Presidential Election and stepped down from his ministerial position on July 29."],"source":{"uri":["onlanka.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["ONLANKA News :.

Gretchen Whitmer's strength as a candidate seeking reelection that year and the abortion ballot question.\n\nPolitical handicappers like Covey have rated two mid-Michigan contests as toss-ups. They include the race to decide who succeeds U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Holly, in a Lansing-based seat she is vacating in favor of a U.S. Senate run. The other is the contest to succeed retiring U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Flint Township, in a district that includes the metro areas of Flint, Saginaw, Midland and Bay City.\n\n\"Slotkin has for the last couple of cycles been one of House Democrats' strongest incumbents,\" Covey said in discussing the 7th District. \"(Democratic President Joe) Biden only won it by 1 point in 2020, and so she was a top target in 2022. That race was the most expensive House race in the country, which goes to show how competitive that seat is.\"\n\nThe circumstances are similar in Michigan's 8th District, Covey added. She noted that Biden won the area currently comprising the district by only 2 points in 2020, and it is made even more competitive by the departure of Kildee, who \"has a family name that goes really far.\" He is serving his sixth term in Congress and is the nephew of Dale Kildee, who spent 36 years in Congress.\n\nThe other two races feature two first-term lawmakers looking to defend their posts on the eastern and western sides of the state.\n\nIn a Metro Detroit showdown that observers say tilts toward the GOP, Republican U.S. Rep. John James of Shelby Township faces a rematch against Democrat and former Macomb County prosecutor Carl Marlinga of Sterling Heights. In a Grand Rapids-area contest that Democrats won handily in 2022, Democratic U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten faces East Grand Rapids lawyer Paul Hudson.\n\nTwo former state lawmakers will compete for the mid-Michigan swing district that was left up for grabs with U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin's Senate run. The contest features former state Sens. Tom Barrett, R-Charlotte, and Curtis Hertel, D-East Lansing.\n\nThe 7th District covers Ingham, Livingston, Clinton and Shiawassee counties along with parts of Eaton, Oakland and Genesee counties. Both Hertel and Barrett ran unopposed in Tuesday's primary, giving them a bit of a reprieve that other competitive seats in Michigan lacked.\n\n\"That's just another sign of how important this race was for both parties, because they didn't want to waste any time and resources dealing with a primary fight,\" Covey said.\n\nBarrett ran unsuccessfully for the 7th District seat in 2022, losing to Slotkin by 5.4 percentage points. But the banner year for Michigan Democrats factored in, as the presence of Whitmer and an abortion rights proposal at the top of the ticket helped the party to flip the House and Senate for the first time in 40 years.\n\nMore: Reps. Haley Stevens, Jack Bergman win primaries as others await fall foes\n\nBarrett is an Iraq veteran and Hertel served as Whitmer's former director of legislative affairs through June 2023.\n\nHertel on Tuesday night said he would place abortion rights, cutting taxes and job creation at the center of his work should he win a term in the U.S. House.\n\n\"In Washington, I'll keep fighting to lower our costs and protect our freedoms, working with reasonable people of any party to actually get things done,\" Hertel said.\n\nBarrett in a statement Tuesday thanked supporters and urged them to get involved with just 90 days left ahead of the general election.\n\n\"I'm ready to continue serving the people of mid-Michigan and deliver common sense results that will protect the middle class, keep our communities safe, and secure our borders,\" Barrett said.\n\nThe 7th District is extremely competitive. Even though Biden would have won it by just under 1 percentage point in 2020, Trump would have won it by close to 4 in 2016, per data from Dave's Redistricting App.\n\nDistrict 8: McDonald Rivet vs. Junge\n\nRepublican Paul Junge of Grand Blanc Township is set to face first-term Democratic state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet of Bay City in mid-Michigan's 8th District, which is covers Genesee, Bay and Saginaw counties and portions of Midland County, including the cities of Bay City, Flint, Midland and Saginaw.\n\nOutside groups poured over $9 million into the 2022 faceoff between the now-retiring U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee and Junge, who lost by more than 10 percentage points.\n\nNational groups have already made TV, cable and digital reservations in the Flint market for the fall, including $1.11 million by the National Republican Congressional Committee, the House GOP's campaign arm; $1.48 million by House Majority PAC, which has ties to the House Democratic leadership; and $2.3 million by the Congressional Leadership Fund, the group endorsed by House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana.\n\nMore: Junge, McDonald Rivet win primaries in race to replace Kildee in Congress\n\n\"The balance of the House is probably going to be determined right here in the state of Michigan, and this is going to be a key battleground,\" Junge said Monday. \"I'm going to work hard every day and as I say, get out and talk to voters.\"\n\nEven before the primary, Junge began running an attack ad against McDonald Rivet, who called the hit \"baseless attacks on immigration.\"\n\nJunge, who is backed by Trump, explained that he was startled the day after the 2022 primary election to find \"just an avalanche of ads\" already running against him. \"And I thought, 'Hey, I'm gonna see if I can get ahead of this,'\" he said. \"Look, it's going to be tough. It's going to be nasty.\"\n\nMcDonald Rivet, who has Kildee's endorsement, on Tuesday previewed what her messaging on Junge will be, saying he's \"trying for a third time to use his trust fund to buy our U.S. House seat\" and that his policy positions would threaten everything from Social Security to the right to abortion.\n\n\"It is full speed ahead. This is a continuous fight all the way to November,\" McDonald Rivet told The Detroit News. \"You gotta sprint right through the tape.\"\n\nDistrict 10: James vs. Marlinga\n\nTwo years ago, James beat Marlinga by 1,600 votes or 0.5 percentage points. Only two races -- central California's 13th District and western Colorado's 3rd District -- had tighter margins. Covey, the Cook Political Report analyst, said the closeness of the outcome was \"a big surprise to a lot of Democrats both nationally and in Michigan.\"\n\nPundits favored James to win the 10th District -- which covers southern Macomb County, Rochester and Rochester Hills -- because of a large financial advantage and wide name ID after two failed bids for U.S. Senate in 2018 and 2020.\n\nSimilar factors are at play in their upcoming rematch. James, 43, now has almost a full term in Congress under his belt and the name recognition and financial benefits that come with that. His campaign had more than $4 million in the bank as of July 17, as compared to just over $100,000 for Marlinga.\n\nMore: Marlinga wins Democratic primary, setting up rematch with GOP's Rep. John James\n\nJames, an Army veteran and former executive at his family's supply-chain business, did not face a primary challenger and has been able to dedicate more time and resources to the general election. James said Monday he would focus his fall campaign on inflation, health care costs, unlawful immigration and the fentanyl crisis.\n\n\"You don't have to imagine a better America,\" James told The Detroit News at the event where dozens of supporters gathered at the Packard Proving Grounds Historic Site in Shelby Township. \"We just have to remember a time a couple of years ago when we were doing a lot better in this country.\"\n\nJames, who is Black, demurred when asked about Trump's recent comments questioning Harris' racial identity last week.\n\n\"Well, the president's thoughts are his own,\" James said. \"And right now, what people are most concerned with is the fact that the Biden-Harris administration is falling further and further and further behind from a cost of living standpoint.\"\n\nMore: JD Vance labels Kamala Harris a 'chameleon,' says GOP's immigration plans improve lives\n\nMarlinga, as he did two years ago, won a crowded primary Tuesday with just under 50% of the votes. The 77-year-old longtime lawyer has served as a prosecutor, judge and assistant U.S. attorney, which analysts said is helpful for own local name recognition. Marlinga said he plans to emphasize personal freedom and reproductive rights in his fall campaign.\n\n\"John James calls abortion genocide and believes that there should be a nationwide ban on abortion. I believe in personal freedom, individual choice and I respect women's right to make her own decisions about her own reproductive health care,\" Marlinga told The News in an election night interview.\n\nCovey said James might also be susceptible to attacks as a \"carpetbagger,\" having moved since 2022 from Farmington Hills -- part of Michigan's 11th District -- to Shelby Township. Members of the House are not required to live in their districts.\n\nDistrict 3: Scholten vs. Hudson\n\nScholten, a first-term Grand Rapids Democrat, will face a much different GOP opponent in Hudson than she did in 2022, when she trounced Republican John Gibbs by more than 13 percentage points.\n\nCovey described Gibbs as a \"very weak candidate.\" Gibbs is a former Trump administration appointee with a penchant for conspiracy theories who was later fired as Ottawa County administrator.\n\nHudson, by contrast, has avoided divisive rhetoric and pitches himself as a common sense conservative modeled after Gerald Ford, the former president from Grand Rapids who also represented west Michigan in the U.S. House for 25 years.\n\nMore: Hudson wins Republican primary to take on Democratic Rep. Scholten in the fall\n\nHudson is a partner at the law firm Miller Canfield who recently moved to East Grand Rapids, having lived in Kalamazoo before that during his unsuccessful 2022 state Supreme Court bid.\n\nThroughout the primary campaign, he emphasized a so-called \"GPS\" plan -- standing for growth, prosperity and security -- to get the country back on track. Hudson told The News during an election night interview that he plans to continue focusing on those issues, which he tied to inflation, securing the U.S. southern border and \"bringing down our government spending.\"\n\nHudson faces an uphill battle against Scholten, an immigration lawyer and former Department of Justice official during the Obama administration.\n\nScholten has said that she is focused on solving immigration issues. \"Having a safe and orderly border is humane,\" she told The News in July. She added that her other main focuses were protecting Social Security and Medicare, lowering prescription drug costs and preserving reproductive rights for women.\n\nScholten lost a U.S. House race to former U.S. Rep. Peter Meijer, R-Grand Rapids Township, in 2020 by 6 percentage points, but that was in a previous iteration of the district that skewed more favorably toward the GOP.\n\nBefore legislative redistricting, Trump won the area comprising the old 3rd District in 2020 by 3.2 percentage points. Biden won the area comprising the new 3rd District by 8.5 points. That swing, in Covey's assessment, means Hudson will have to significantly outperform Trump in November.\n\n\"This is not a race that major Republican outside groups are reserving ad money into,\" Covey said. \"If we see Trump on the rise in Michigan, then maybe this is a race that could become more competitive. But I think right now, Scholten definitely starts as the favorite.\"\n\nHudson's candidacy has the backing from a political action committee called West Michigan for Change, which was initially funded solely by a $1 million donation from Ryan Hudson, Paul's younger brother and a wealthy tech entrepreneur."],"source":{"uri":["detroitnews.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["The Detroit News"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2023/07/07/PDTN/e9bf1960-9a0e-4685-b524-53c2d6d7fe80-2023-barrett-hertel-combo.jpg?auto=webp&crop=2699,1519,x0,y36&format=pjpg&width=1200"],"eventUri":["eng-9794330"],"sentiment":[0.349],"wgt":[460782612],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["2024-08-447553180"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-08"],"time":["03:09:09"],"dateTime":["2024-08-08T03:09:09Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T21:59:14Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.6078],"url":["https://hillreporter.com/project2025-leader-postpones-own-book-launch-until-after-election-commentary"],"title":["Project2025 Leader Postpones Own Book Launch Until After Election [COMMENTARY]"],"body":["The architect of Project2025, Kevin Roberts, was all set to release a book about what he calls \"a peaceful Second American Revolution,\" but now he's decided to postpone its launch to wait to see who wins the 2024 presidential election.\n\nWeird, I wonder why.\n\nRoberts, who makes House Speaker Mike Johnson look open-minded, is the guy who runs the Heritage Foundation, aka the Christian cult-like think-tank creating the blueprint for taking over America a la The Handmaid's Tale.\n\n\"There's a time for writing, reading, and book tours -- and a time to put down the books and go fight like hell to take back our country,\" said Roberts in a statement.\n\nProject2025 is directly linked to Donald Trump's campaign, with Roberts being named as a potential Chief of Staff.

Credit: Gage Skidmore from Peoria, AZ, United States of America, CC BY-SA 2.0 , via Wikimedia Commons\n\nControversy has erupted following Vice President Kamala Harris's announcement of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate for the 2024 presidential election. Critics have pointed to Walz's connections with Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center, a mosque in Minnesota alleged to have ties to ISIS recruitment and extremist teachings.\n\nGovernor Walz has been documented attending events at Dar Al-Farooq, an Islamic center catering primarily to the Somali community in Minneapolis. The center has gained notoriety for being a recruitment hub for ISIS terrorists, according to FBI reports. Critics argue that Walz's association with the mosque raises serious questions about his suitability as a vice-presidential candidate.\n\nThe controversy intensified with the revelation of a report based on FBI statistics. This report highlighted that Minneapolis's Somali community has become a significant recruitment center for terrorists. The FBI statistics showed that 45 Somalis left the U.S. to join terrorist organizations like al-Shabab and ISIS, with a dozen more arrested for attempting to join ISIS as of 2018. Many of these individuals attended Dar Al-Farooq, Minnesota's most popular Somali mosque.\n\nImam Waleed Idris al-Meneesey, who leads Dar Al-Farooq, is at the heart of the controversy. Al-Meneesey has been documented making inflammatory statements, including calls for the killing of Jews and urging Muslims to adhere strictly to Sharia law, rejecting Western legal systems. His leadership and teachings at Dar Al-Farooq have sparked significant concern among critics who argue that such connections are alarming for a public official.\n\nAdding to the controversy is a 2008 declaration by the Assembly of Muslim Jurists Association of America (AMJA), where al-Meneesey sits on the FATWA committee. This declaration advised Muslims against cooperating with law enforcement in non-Islamic countries, including the FBI. This stance is seen as particularly problematic given the ongoing fight against domestic and international terrorism.\n\nCritics have shared images and screenshots online, showcasing Governor Walz's presence at Dar Al-Farooq and highlighting his and Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan's public support for the center. Flanagan's social media post declaring their solidarity with Dar Al-Farooq has been cited as further evidence of the administration's controversial ties.\n\nThe backlash has been swift and fierce. Opponents argue that a vice-presidential candidate with such associations is a national security risk. They question how voters can support a candidate linked to a mosque whose imam advocates for violence and non-cooperation with law enforcement.\n\nSupporters of Walz and Harris dismiss these criticisms as politically motivated attacks aimed at undermining their campaign. They argue that Walz's outreach to diverse communities is part of his effort to promote inclusivity and understanding.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Governor Tim Walz's ties to Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center highlights the complex and often contentious intersection of politics, religion, and national security. As the election season heats up, these issues will likely remain in the spotlight, challenging candidates to address and navigate the criticisms head-on."],"source":{"uri":["econotimes.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["EconoTimes"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://f1.econotimes.com/2024/08/f8iusdxpnf_th_1024x0.jpg"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[-0.1137],"wgt":[460782516],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["2024-08-447548668"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-08"],"time":["03:01:16"],"dateTime":["2024-08-08T03:01:16Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-08T03:00:09Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://english.newsfirst.lk/2024/8/8/presidential-poll-candidate-registrations-increase"],"title":["Presidential Poll: Candidate Registrations Increase"],"body":["COLOMBO (News 1st); The race for the 2024 presidential election is heating up, with the number of candidates who have deposited securities rising to 22 as of last night.\n\nAn official statement from the commission highlighted that among the registrants, 11 recognized political parties have successfully deposited security money.\n\nAdditionally, the commission noted that 10 independent candidates, along with another political party, have also met the requirements by depositing bonds.\n\nAs the election draws nearer, the commission emphasizes the importance of fair play and adherence to legal guidelines."],"source":{"uri":["english.newsfirst.lk"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["english.newsfirst.lk"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://cdn.newsfirst.lk/english-uploads/2024/08/cb982205-election_crop-711181_850x460-763209_850x460.jpg"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.5294],"wgt":[460782076],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8264483609"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-08"],"time":["02:50:53"],"dateTime":["2024-08-08T02:50:53Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-08T02:50:11Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://gazette.com/news/wex/who-is-peggy-flanagan-a-harris-walz-win-could-shake-up-minnesota-politics/article_8bf16951-3894-5128-a691-f2c911f3fb17.html"],"title":["Who is Peggy Flanagan?

Tim Walz (D), who is facing accusations of stolen valor, allegedly falsely claimed in a previous press release that he was a veteran of Afghanistan.\n\nIn a 2006 press release issued by his campaign, Walz was described as being a \"veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom.\"\n\nThe war in Afghanistan, which began on October 7, 2001, was called Operation Enduring Freedom, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command website. The operation's start came after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\n\"Democrat Tim Walz will spend Sunday, Feb. 19th and Monday, Feb. 20th traveling across Minnesota's 1st Congressional District as he formally announces his candidacy for the United States House of Representatives,\" the press release said. \"Walz, a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom and longtime Mankato educator is unopposed for the DFL endorsement and is slated to challenge Rep. Gil Gutknecht in November of 2006.\"\n\nIn a photo posted to X, Walz can be seen holding a sign that says, \"Enduring Freedom Veterans for Kerry,\" in protest of former President George W. Bush visiting Minnesota in 2004.\n\nThe Washington Free Beacon reported that David Thul, a veteran of the Iraq war, addressed the issue that Walz was claiming to be a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom with his aides in 2009.\n\nOne staffer reportedly claimed she was \"not aware\" that Walz had served in Afghanistan, while another aide reportedly \"acknowledged that constituents could get the false impression,\" according to the outlet.\n\nOn Tuesday, Vice President Kamala Harris announced that she was picking Walz to be her running mate in the 2024 presidential election. Since then, Walz has faced accusations of stolen valor and criticism from veterans\n\nIn a viral video, Walz can be heard claiming he had served in war, although he had never seen combat during his time serving in the United States military:\n\nI spent 25 years in the Army, and I hunt ... I've been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks. We can do CDC research ... We can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at.\n\nWalz admitted in a 2018 interview with MPR News that he had not seen combat, adding that he had \"got far more out of the military\" than \"they got out of\" him.\n\n\"I know that there are certainly folks that did far more than I did,\" Walz said. \"I know that. I willingly say that I got far more out of the military than they got out of me, from the GI Bill to leadership opportunities to everything else.\"\n\nIn Walz's biography on his website, he lists having a higher rank than the one he had when he retired from the U.S. military.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported:\n\nWalz served in the Minnesota Army National Guard and retired at the rank of master sergeant, or an E-8. However, on his official website bio, he lists a higher rank that he served at for a short period that ultimately was rescinded, as he did not complete all the requirements to serve at that rank. However, his bio implies that he retired at the rank of command sergeant major, or an E-9.\n\nOn Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre avoided a question related to accusations of Walz's stolen valor."],"source":{"uri":["breitbart.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Breitbart"]},"authors":[{"uri":["elizabeth_weibel@breitbart.com"],"name":["Elizabeth Weibel"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/08/WI-Minnesota-Gov-Tim-Walz-Aug-7-2024-AP.jpg"],"eventUri":["eng-9800064"],"sentiment":[0.0824],"wgt":[460780022],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8264442297"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-08"],"time":["02:00:45"],"dateTime":["2024-08-08T02:00:45Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-08T01:58:37Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/08/40240686/harris-maga-camo-cap-emerges-as-potent-rival-to-iconic-trump-maga-headgear-sales-near-1m-mark-since"],"title":["Harris-Maga Camo Cap Emerges As Potent Rival To Iconic Trump MAGA Headgear, Sales Near $1M Mark Since Tuesday Launch"],"body":["The Harris-Walz campaign has confirmed that their camo hats, branded with \"Harris Walz\", sold out within a day of release, generating nearly $1 million in sales.\n\nWhat Happened: The campaign initially produced 3,000 hats, which sold out in less than 30 minutes. Each hat, American and union made, was sold for $40. The hats became a sensation after Vice President Kamala Harris announced that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) was her running mate. The announcement video featured Gov. Walz in camo gear at his St. Paul home, sparking interest in the campaign's camo hats, reported The Hill.\n\nThe hats' popularity led to Gov. Walz being dubbed a \"Midwest Princess\" online, a reference to pop singer Chappell Roan's merchandise. The campaign stated that the inspiration for the hat came from Gov. Walz himself, who was seen wearing a camo hat during a video call with Harris.\n\nSee Also: Mike Pence Urged To Endorse Kamala Harris's Presidential Run By 'Republicans For Harris' -- 'Do The Right\n\nFollowing the hats' success, Teen Vogue speculated whether the camo hat might become as iconic as the red hats associated with former President Donald Trump's supporters. Gov. Walz was seen wearing the hat at his first rally with Harris in Philadelphia, where he said he was \"capping off the night.\"\n\nWhy It Matters: When Harris asked Walz to be her running mate, he was in his St. Paul home wearing khakis and his signature camouflage hat. The hat, now part of the Harris campaign's merchandise, became an instant hit, selling 3,000 units in 30 minutes and generating over $1 million in sales, benefiting the Harris Victory Fund, noted USA Today.\n\nIn contrast, Trump's iconic red MAGA hat, which Jared Kushner claims brought in up to $80,000 a day during the 2016 campaign, is a legendary piece of political merchandise. The Trump campaign's extensive merch strategy has included everything from golden sneakers to NFTs, raising significant funds and capitalizing on Trump's image.\n\nWhile Unionwear's CEO Mitch Cahn notes that the initial Kamala-Walz hat demand exceeds that of the early MAGA hats, it remains to be seen if it will achieve the same lasting cultural impact.\n\nThe Harris-Walz ticket has been gaining momentum in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election. Prior to the selection of Gov. Walz as her running mate, Vice President Harris was already leading in the polls against former President Trump. The introduction of the camo hats seems to have further boosted their campaign's visibility and popularity.\n\nWith President Joe Biden not running for re-election in 2024, Vice President Harris quickly became the frontrunner for the Democratic Party. The betting markets show a close race between Harris and Trump, but the recent surge in support for the Harris-Walz ticket, as evidenced by the rapid sell-out of their campaign hats, indicates a shift in voter sentiment.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\nCheck This Out:\n\nLawmakers Made Huge Investments This Year.

This strategic choice is designed to enhance the Democratic ticket's appeal in key Midwestern battleground states, where Walz's moderate views resonate strongly with rural and suburban voters. His prudent approach to cryptocurrency aligns with the concerns of constituents wary of rapid financial changes, adding a vital dimension of financial conservatism to the campaign.\n\nThis addition to the ticket contrasts sharply with Harris's strong base in California, broadening the geographical and ideological appeal of the Democratic campaign. Walz's background and political stance provide a complement to Harris's more progressive policies, aiming to create a balanced and appealing platform for a diverse electorate. The pairing underscores the campaign's strategy to unite various voter demographics under a common banner, enhancing their prospects in a competitive electoral landscape.\n\nTim Walz's political background makes him a valuable addition to the Democratic ticket. His connection with rural and moderate voters could be critical in swing states.\n\nHis Midwestern sensibility is likely to resonate well with voters in these regions.\n\nWhile Walz has not specifically addressed the cryptocurrency industry, his strong stance on energy policy is significant. He signed a law committing Minnesota to 100% clean energy by 2040. This has implications for the crypto industry, particularly Bitcoin mining, which faces criticism for high energy usage.\n\nWalz's clean energy views as a potential Vice President could affect crypto mining operations nationwide. His push for sustainable practices might encourage miners to adopt eco-friendly methods. This could attract environmentally conscious voters but might challenge support from the crypto community.\n\nWithin the Democratic Party, opinions on cryptocurrency vary. Figures like Elizabeth Warren oppose it in its current form, while others are more open to it. The Republican nominee Donald Trump's support for crypto has put pressure on Harris and the Democrats to adopt a friendlier stance.\n\nCrypto's increasing importance in the U.S. is clear. One in three American voters is more inclined to invest in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies following the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. This pressure may lead Walz to reconsider his stance on energy and crypto to win over the crypto community.\n\nHarris's choice of crypto-cautious VP Tim Walz is a strategic move to broaden voter appeal. Walz's Midwest influence complements Harris's coastal base, potentially strengthening the Democratic ticket in key states. His clean energy stance might attract voters concerned about the environment.\n\nHowever, the growing influence of the crypto community cannot be ignored. Harris and Walz will need to handle this issue carefully. Their approach to crypto could significantly impact voter support.\n\nWalz's clean energy legislation could shape the future of crypto mining in the U.S. His policies might encourage sustainable mining practices, aligning with broader environmental goals. This could be appealing to some voters but might alienate parts of the crypto community.\n\nIn conclusion, the selection of crypto-cautious VP Tim Walz by Harris brings a unique aspect to the Democratic ticket for the 2024 election. His Midwest appeal and clean energy policies are seen as significant advantages. However, the growing importance of crypto presents new challenges.\n\nHarris and Walz will need to balance their positions to gain widespread support. The crypto community's influence means their stance on this issue could be crucial for many voters.\n\nAs the election approaches, the impact of the crypto-cautious VP Tim Walz on the Democratic ticket will become clearer. His policies and positions will be closely watched as voters decide their support. The future of crypto in the U.S. may depend on the decisions made by Harris and Walz in the coming months.\n\nStay connected to The BIT Journal for the latest updates on this developing story.

One particularly intriguing development is the upcoming memoir by former First Lady Melania Trump, set to release soon.\n\nTitled Melania, the memoir described as a powerful and inspiring story, promises to offer an intimate glimpse into her life, revealing personal stories and family photos that were never shared with the public before.\n\nWith her husband and former President Donald Trump, actively campaigning for a return to the White House, the timing and content of this memoir could significantly influence the political climate.\n\nFirst for Melania\n\nMelania has always been a figure shrouded in mystery, maintaining a low profile even during her tenure as First Lady. Her memoir marks the first time she will tell her own story at length, providing readers with an inside look at her life.\n\nPublished by Skyhorse Publishing, known for its association with Trump allies such as Rudolph Giuliani and Alan Dershowitz, the book is expected to cater to a wide audience. The memoir will be available in two versions: a collector's edition and a memoir edition, with the former including 48 pages of never-before-seen photographs.\n\nThe release of Melania's memoir comes at a critical juncture in the upcoming presidential campaign. Donald, amid his efforts to reclaim the presidency, faces multiple legal challenges and ongoing scrutiny over past scandals.\n\nThe memoir could either bolster his campaign by humanising the Trump family and offering a sympathetic portrayal of Melania or exacerbate existing controversies, depending on the revelations contained within.\n\nMelania's memoir might serve to soften her public image, portraying her as a resilient figure who has overcome adversity. However, the memoir's release also invites renewed attention to the numerous allegations of infidelity and sexual misconduct surrounding her husband.\n\nThese allegations have been a persistent thorn in Donald's political career and the memoir could either address these issues directly or skirt around them, influencing public perception in different ways.\n\nRevisiting rumours of infidelity\n\nDonald's personal life has long been the subject of public fascination and controversy. His marriages, affairs and the numerous allegations of sexual misconduct have frequently made headlines. The publication of Melania's memoir could reignite discussions about these aspects of Donald's life, potentially overshadowing his political platform and campaign messages.\n\nThe memoir's potential to dredge up past scandals might have mixed repercussions. On one hand, it could galvanise Donald's base, who may view the memoir as a candid and courageous account of Melania's life.\n\nOn the other hand, it might alienate undecided voters who are wary of the personal and ethical controversies surrounding Donald. The depiction of Melania's experiences and her perspective on the allegations against her husband could sway public opinion in unpredictable ways.\n\nImplications for Trump campaign\n\nFrom a strategic standpoint, the Trump campaign might leverage Melania's memoir to highlight her role as a supportive spouse and devoted mother, emphasising themes of family unity and resilience.\n\nThis narrative could resonate with voters who value personal integrity and familial loyalty. Conversely, the campaign must also prepare for the possibility that the memoir could trigger negative media coverage and reignite scrutiny over Donald's past behaviour.\n\nThe timing of the memoir's release, potentially before the election, adds another layer of complexity. If the book generates significant media attention and public discourse, it could either enhance or detract from Donald's campaign efforts."],"source":{"uri":["thesun.my"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["thesun.my"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://thesun.my/binrepository/480x275/0c25/480d250/none/11808/QUEJ/4415255_4419249_20240808092648.jpg"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.0431],"wgt":[460777025],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8264412843"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-08"],"time":["01:20:57"],"dateTime":["2024-08-08T01:20:57Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-08T01:20:14Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.5843],"url":["https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/politics/3045239-harris-and-walz-rally-midwest-democratic-strategy-in-full-swing"],"title":["Harris and Walz Rally Midwest: Democratic Strategy in Full Swing | Politics"],"body":["Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, held rallies in Wisconsin and Michigan as part of their Democratic campaign for the 2024 presidential election.

He wanted everyone in the sport to have a strong political voice.\n\n\"I want to have a voice, and I do want to stand up for injustices. So, I've been trying to find my voice, and I think part of that journey is to educate myself. And then I've been very deep in that and trying to learn and educate. I've been on the phone with friends of mine like [NASCAR driver] Bubba Wallace, other friends of color and race that I've known through the years, and just checking in, trying to understand, and asking them deeper questions that haven't come up in our relationship so far,\" he said.\n\n\"And to learn and understand just how far and wide and how frequent that my friends have dealt with issues, that's helping me find my voice and have clarity in this situation, in all the noise that's out there.\n\n\"It's obviously a very divisive topic, and I know there's a lot going on in the media. So, I've found, in my opinion, the best route is to talk to my friends of color and understand their perspective, to help me understand my perspective and find my voice, ultimately.\"\n\nJohnson was among those who were speaking out in support of the Black community.\n\n\"It hurts to see our country being torn apart by racism & hate. I can't pretend to understand what black men & women have experienced but I can speak out & condemn racial inequality. I hope love for all mankind can prevail & make changes to build a better future for our children,\" he wrote on social media.\n\nHe added a quote from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.: \"Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.\"\n\nIt'll be interesting to see if Johnson chooses to speak out ahead of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nRelated: Danica Patrick Announces She's Getting Into Politics"],"source":{"uri":["postandcourier.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Post and Courier"]},"authors":[{"uri":["andrew_holleran@postandcourier.com"],"name":["Andrew Holleran"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.2627],"wgt":[460774621],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8264391446"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-08"],"time":["00:54:58"],"dateTime":["2024-08-08T00:54:58Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-08T00:53:16Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.10news.com/us-news/jason-carter-talks-with-scripps-news-about-the-2024-race-jimmy-carters-100th-birthday-and-more"],"title":["Jason Carter talks with Scripps News about the 2024 race, Jimmy Carter's 100th birthday, and more"],"body":["On Wednesday, Scripps News spoke with Jason Carter, grandson of former President Jimmy Carter and chair of the Carter Center Board of Trustees.

We had 7,000 volunteers signed up since the switch to Vice President Harris. And so we have all the ingredients that we need.

Tim Walz - her newly named running mate - in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, with stops Wednesday in Wisconsin and Michigan. And staying in close proximity was Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS AND HER NEWLY NAMED RUNNING MATE KICK OFF A BATTLEGROUND STATE SWING\n\nWalz took aim at Trump at Wednesday afternoon's rally, charging that the former President \"sees the world differently than we see it. He has no understanding of service. Because he's too busy serving himself again and again and again.\"\n\n\"This guy weakens our country to strengthen his own hands. He mocks our laws. He sows chaos and division amongst the people. And that's to say nothing of the job he did as president,\" Walz argued.\n\nHours earlier, Trump â\" in an interview on \"Fox and Friends\" â\" belittled the naming to the Democrats' ticket of Walz, a former high school teacher and football coach turned Democratic congressman in a red district before winning election and re-election as governor.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT HARRIS NAMES MINNESOTA GOV TIM WALZ AS HER RUNNING MATE\n\n\"I could not be more thrilled,\" Trump said when asked about the announcement from Harris on Tuesday that she chose Walz as her running mate, after also seriously considering Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona.\n\n\"I was shocked when, when it came down to the final two, that she didn't pick Shapiro. I was very surprised,\" Trump said.\n\nBut the naming of a running mate has been lucrative for the Harris campaign, which highlighted that it had hauled in $36 million in fundraising in the 24 hours since the Walz announcement.\n\nAt the rally, which the Harris campaign said attracted a crowd of over 12,000 people to a festival field amid farmland outside this small northwest Wisconsin city, Walz once again argued that Trump and Vance \"are creepy and weird as hell.\"\n\nVance, at a campaign event miles away, pushed back on the \"weird\" label, saying that he and Trump are \"normal guys who want to make this country great.\"\n\nIn a viral moment, Vance appeared to try and troll the vice president, as he approached Air Force Two at Chippewa Valley Regional Airport, where the senator's campaign plane was also parked.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I figured that I would come by and get a good look at the plane because hopefully itâs going to be my plane in a few months,\" Vance said in front of Air Force Two.\n\nAnd once again pointing out that Harris has yet to sit for a major interview or hold a press conference in the two and a half weeks since she replaced President Biden at the top of the Democrats' national ticket, Vance told reporters \"I also thought you guys may get lonely, because the VP doesnât answer questions from reporters.\"\n\nBiden dropped his re-election bid on July 21, after a disastrous debate performance against Trump in late June prompted increased questions over whether the 81-year-old president had the physical and mental abilities to serve another four years in the White House. It also sparked a rising chorus of calls from fellow Democrats for Biden to end his re-election bid.\n\nHarris didn't mention her boss at a large rally in Atlanta last week, nor did she or Walz reference the president at their rally Tuesday night in Philadelphia.\n\nBut Harris, in her sixth visit to Wisconsin so far this year, praised the president at the top of her comments.\n\n\"I want to bring greetings from our incredible president, Joe Biden,\" Harris said. \"He loves Wisconsin, and I know we are all deeply grateful for his lifetime of service to our nation and for all he continues to do.\"\n\nAfter the crowd broke out in a chant of \"Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe!,\" the vice president responded \"that's right.

Please try again later.\n\nTim Walz was weighing a life-altering decision when he stepped into a supply room at the National Guard Armory in New Ulm, Minn., nearly two decades ago. He closed the door behind him, recalled a colleague, Al Bonnifield, and confided he was considering whether to leave their unit even though it was preparing to go to war so he could run for Congress.\n\n\"It was a very long conversation behind closed doors,\" said Bonnifield. \"He was trying to decide where he could do better for soldiers, for veterans, for the country. He weighed that for a long time.\"\n\nWalz, 60, ultimately chose to leave the Guard in 2005 and went on to win a House seat the following year, unseating a Republican incumbent as a populist wave of opposition to the Iraq War lifted Democrats to a majority of both chambers of Congress. That jump-started a political career that saw him elected governor of Minnesota in 2018 and, this week, selected as Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate in a heated race for the White House.\n\nBut while Walz and his political allies have cited his 24 years of military experience as an asset, the circumstances of his departure from the National Guard and his characterization of his service already have come under attack. At least three former Guard colleagues have publicly voiced bitterness at Walz's decision to leave their unit at such a consequential moment. It's not clear how widespread that feeling was, but the Trump campaign has moved quickly to capitalize on the issue.\n\n\"Nobody wants to go to war. I didn't want to go, but I went,\" Doug Julin, a retired National Guard soldier who worked with Walz, said in an interview. \"The big frustration was that he let his troops down.\"\n\nSkip to end of carousel\n\n2024 presidential election\n\narrow leftarrow right\n\nFollow live updates on the 2024 election and Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump from our reporters on the campaign trail and in Washington.\n\nTrump and Harris have officially secured their party's presidential nominations. Trump chose Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) as his running mate, and Harris picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\n(The Washington Post)\n\nCheck out how Harris and Trump stack up according to The Washington Post's presidential polling averages of seven battleground states.\n\nSign up for The Campaign Moment, reporter Aaron Blake's guide to what you really need to know about the 2024 election.\n\n1/4\n\nEnd of carousel\n\nThe Harris campaign did not address criticisms from fellow soldiers that he retired to avoid going to war. Instead, the campaign said that while in Congress he was a \"tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform.\" As vice president, the campaign said in a statement to The Washington Post, \"he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families.\"\n\nWalz, a native of West Point, Neb., enlisted in the Nebraska Army National Guard at age 17. His father served during the Korean War era, and urged both him and his sister to enlist, Walz said during a 2009 interview for an oral history project by the Library of Congress. Walz shifted to the Minnesota Army National Guard in 1996 after relocating with his wife, Gwen. He was activated for a variety of missions, including responses to forest fires, tornadoes and flooding.\n\nOn Wednesday, Walz also came under scrutiny for saying during a gubernatorial campaign event in 2018 that \"we can make sure those weapons of war that I carried in war\" are not on America's streets. Walz did not serve in combat, according to the Minnesota Army National Guard, and his Republican counterpart jumped on those comments.\n\n\"He said we shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on America's streets,\" JD Vance, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, said during a campaign event in Michigan. \"Well, I wonder. Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?\"\n\nThe Harris campaign, in response to those comments, said in its statement to The Post that Walz carried, fired and trained others how to use \"weapons of war innumerable times.\" It declined to address why Walz claimed incorrectly to have done so in war.\n\n\"Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country,\" the statement said. Vance, a Marine Corps veteran, served in Iraq in a noncombat role for six months beginning in fall 2005.\n\nWalz and his political allies also have inaccurately described him as a retired command sergeant major, one rank higher than he holds in retirement. Walz himself did so in a video clip from 2006 that was surfaced by C-SPAN on Tuesday and in a 2018 clip posted on his own YouTube account.\n\n\"I'm a retired sergeant major in the Army and the Army National Guard,\" he told a group of voters in the latter video.\n\nThough Walz did achieve the rank of command sergeant major, it was a provisional rank until he completed required coursework for senior leaders, National Guard officials said. He did not do so by the time he departed the military and his retirement rank reverted to master sergeant on May 15, 2005, officials said. Walz retired the next day.\n\nThe Harris campaign declined to address why Walz has inaccurately said he retired as one. He has sometimes called himself a \"former command sergeant major,\" which is accurate.\n\nWalz, asked by the oral-history interviewer where his combat experience occurred, said initially that his unit -- the 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery -- had served \"throughout the European theater with Operation Enduring Freedom,\" the name the Pentagon used to describe the war in Afghanistan and other counterterrorism assignments.\n\nWalz clarified later in the interview that he and his fellow Guard members initially thought they would fire artillery, but later learned they would be assigned in Europe to backfill other U.S. troops who were going to war.\n\n\"I think in the beginning, many of my troops were disappointed,\" Walz said, recalling how he was assigned in Vicenza, Italy. \"I think they felt a little guilty, many of them, that they weren't enough in the fight up front as this was happening.\"\n\nBut Thomas Behrends, a retired command sergeant major who also was on that deployment, said it was very clear that their unit was not going to war.\n\n\"He's sugarcoating it to make it more than it was,\" Behrends said. After 9/11, he added, the Air Force realized it needed to better safeguard its airfields and requested the National Guard to assist.\n\n\"That was the mission from the get-go,\" Behrends said. \"There was nothing ever said about going to combat.\"\n\nBehrends has been a vocal critic of Walz's since at least 2018, when he and another Guard member, Paul Herr, placed a scathing letter to the editor in a local newspaper, the West Central Tribune, that accused Walz of exaggerating his military career for years as he ran for governor.\n\n\"He failed his country. He failed his state. He failed the Minnesota Army National Guard, the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, and his fellow Soldiers,\" Behrends and Herr wrote. \"And he failed to lead by example. Shameful.\"\n\nBehrends, who replaced Walz as the unit's command sergeant major, has donated to Republican political causes in the past. In 2022, he promoted a petition on his Facebook page demanding that Walz resign as governor, posting a photo of a grain silo -- Behrends is a farmer -- festooned with the phrase \"Walz is a traitor!\"\n\nHe also stood next to Walz's gubernatorial opponent, Republican Scott Jensen, at a campaign event that year and donated $2,500 to Jensen's campaign, records show. He acknowledged in an interview Wednesday that he has made political donations in the past and said they were not about politics. He went on to call Walz \"as far left as they come,\" and said he can't speak to whether other candidates are lying, but does know \"for a fact that Tim Walz is lying about his record.\"\n\n\"I always thought he was somebody that talked too much,\" he said of their time serving together. \"It was like, 'God, could he just sit down and shut up?' But he liked to hear himself talk, the same as he does now.\"\n\nJoe Eustice, who served in the National Guard with Walz for at least a decade, said he vehemently disagrees with Walz's politics but described him as a good soldier. In an interview, he rejected assertions that Walz avoided combat duty. In late spring 2005, when Walz said he wanted to pursue politics and decided to retire, there was only speculation of a combat deployment on the horizon, Eustice said.\n\n\"Other than having a rumor, we were not notified that we were going to be deployed,\" Eustice said.\n\nThe unit received an official alert order two months after Walz had retired, the Minnesota National Guard said, which helped the unit prepare for mobilization later in the fall.\n\nWalz, when asked by the Library of Congress historian about his retirement, said that he did so to run for Congress, adding that he was concerned about trying to serve in the military and run for office simultaneously. He also cited worries about the Hatch Act, which restricts partisan political activity by federal employees.\n\nJulin, who oversaw Walz as a more senior command sergeant major, said that Walz approached him in 2005 and said he was prepared to go on their upcoming deployment to Iraq, but also was interested in running for Congress. Julin said he thought \"no big deal\" because other members of Congress had deployed.\n\nBut a couple of months later, Julin learned from another member of the Guard that Walz had retired. Julin was frustrated, he said, because Walz had arranged his retirement with two officers who outranked Julin.\n\n\"I would have analyzed it and challenged him,\" Julin said. \"It would have been a different discussion, but he went to the higher ranks. He knew I would have told him, 'Suck it up, we're going.'\"\n\nBonnifield, who listened as Walz pondered his future nearly 20 years ago, said the future politician appeared then to have no fear about the possibility of danger.\n\n\"He was not that kind of man,\" said Bonnifield. \"Absolutely not.\"\n\nThe deployment to Iraq turned out to be grueling for their unit, which was deployed to Camp Scania, a way station between Baghdad and Kuwait constantly targeted by insurgents with rockets and other long-range fire, Bonnifield said. On the day their deployment was supposed to end, he said, it was extended an extra six months. The soldiers were away from home for a total of 22 months, he said, and multiple people died.\n\nBonnifield, who described himself as a Democrat willing to vote across party lines, said he thought Walz made the right career decision. He later voted for Walz, whom he said he has spoken to only once since, during a chance encounter at a political event.\n\n\"If I had the same choices, I probably would have done the same thing,\" he said.\n\nPatrick Murphy, the first Iraq War veteran elected to Congress, met Walz on Capitol Hill in 2006 during their orientation as freshman lawmakers, Murphy said in an interview. They quickly bonded while rooming together in a modest apartment on Capitol Hill, he said.\n\nBoth felt the Iraq War was a disaster, and Walz said he believed he could do more as a policymaker to avoid such conflicts rather than deploy again, Murphy recalled. While Walz did not see combat, his service in Italy still meant leaving his family behind.\n\n\"We have yanked these citizen-soldiers around for the last two decades,\" Murphy said. \"The Pentagon, the Army, they pick where you go.

Tim Walz to join the ticket. The governor was relatively unknown before Tuesday but his history, experience and record are now being scrutinized as voters and pollsters attempt to determine how this decision will impact the race.\n\nHere's a closer look at how voters are feeling amid this unusual and rapidly shifting race for the White House.\n\n\"Click states on this interactive map to create your own 2024 election forecast.

Source: 270toWin.\"\n\nGenerally, Harris has been rising in the polls since it was announced that she would be running and became the Democratic party's presumptive nominee -- although she's only beating the former president out by a small margin so far.\n\nThe smallest margins are seen in the latest CBS News and New York Times polls.\n\nCBS shows Harris leading Trump but one point nationally. The poll was released Sunday and suggests that Harris' boost is due in part to younger and Black voters, who appear to be more engaged and therefore more likely to vote, and by women who believe Harris will favor their interests.\n\nThe New York Times also puts Harris one point ahead of Trump, noting significant improvement from when her candidacy was hypothetical to when she secured enough delegates to become the party's presumptive nominee. Harris will officially be confirmed as the nominee at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which could bring a further jump for the vice president.\n\nThe latest Morning Consult poll released Monday hows that Harris is steadily extending her lead. Their numbers show Harris leading Trump 48% to 44% with 5% of registered voters saying they would vote for \"someone else\" and 4% saying they don't know. It's the third consecutive week that the poll has shown Harris ahead of Trump.\n\nAccording to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist National Poll, Harris leads Trump by 3 percentage points with 51% of the vote compared to Trump's 48%. Two percent of respondents remain undecided. The gap widens among independent voters with 53% saying they would vote for Harris and 44% saying they would vote for Trump. Among those independents, 3% are undecided.\n\nTrump isn't down in all the polls though. He was leading Harris in the July Harvard CAPS-Harris poll by four points -- 52% to 48%. A Wall Street Journal poll published shortly after Biden dropped out showed the former president was beating Harris 49% to 47%, though they noted that Harris' entry into the race effectively ended the solid lead Trump had over Biden amid the serious age concerns troubling young voters.\n\nIn a poll generated by RealClearPolitics, which averages the latest data from 11 major polling sites, Harris leads Trump by a 0.5% margin. That small lead is exemplified by data that shows while she has an overall favorable outlook nationally, Harris and Trump face extremely tight races in battleground states including Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nIt's a bit early to see how adding Walz name to the ticket is going to impact the race. The governor was little-known outside of his home state ahead of the announcement and voters are still familiarizing themselves with his record.\n\nAt a rally Tuesday, Harris spoke to Walz's accolades, highlighting his progressive policies that led to legislation protecting women's reproductive rights, cutting taxes for the middle class, expanding paid leave for workers and establishing free school meal programs statewide.\n\nBut according to another NPR/PBS News/Marist National survey published Tuesday, nearly three-fourths of registered voters said they didn't know enough about Walz to have either a favorable or unfavorable impression of him. Just 17% of those surveyed said they viewed Walz positively and 12% said they had an unfavorable view of him.\n\nOverall, Walz favored lower than others who made the shortlist of contenders for the vice presidential nomination. Mark Kelly and Josh Shapiro were better known and more popular than Walz.\n\nIt's yet to be seen how voters react to Walz but his folksy, Midwestern roots and past professions as both a high school teacher and football coach, and a military veteran are seen as overwhelmingly favorable traits. It could be the key to boosting Harris' chances at the White House.\n\nWalz is also an outspoken gun owner but believes in stricter regulation -- a middle-of-the-road approach to a contentious issue that could attract moderate voters.\n\nSupport for 60-year-old Walz appears to be growing on social media, particularly with a viral clip of the governor starting the Harris campaign's \"weird\" attack line against former President Donald Trump and JD Vance.\n\n\"These are weird people on the other side. They want to take books away. They want to be in your exam room,\" Walz said in a TV interview last month.\n\nThe line took off among young voters -- a key demographic Democrats continue to rely upon to boost poll numbers.\n\nWith Walz being named to Harris' ticket, there's already been talk about a debate between him and Trump's vice presidential running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance.\n\nOverall, Vance is better known to Americans. He began to gain notoriety back in 2016 after his best-selling book, 'Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis' was published. It was then turned into a film that was released in November 2020 amid growing tension between conservative rural America and Democratic-leaning urban areas.\n\nCompared with Walz, 34 percent of respondents in the NPR/PBS News/Marist National survey said they view Vance favorably, while 43 percent view him unfavorably. But negative views appear to be increasing.\n\nIn July, 28 percent said they viewed him favorably, compared to 31 percent who viewed him unfavorably. Twenty-three percent of respondents are not sure how they view the Ohio senator, according to the survey.\n\nVance has recently faced backlash over resurfaced comments Vance made about Vice President Harris and other Democrats in a 2021 Fox News interview, saying they're \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\"\n\nA recent A YouGov/The Economist poll showed that among registered voters, men are more positive about Vance than women are with 45% of men viewing the VP favorably and 47% unfavorably. Meanwhile, 34% of women view Vance favorably and 48% unfavorably.\n\nAdditionally, the same poll revealed that only 30% of registered voters say Vance is qualified to serve as president while 45% say he is n"],"source":{"uri":["fox35orlando.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["FOX 35 Orlando"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox5dc.com/www.fox5dc.com/content/uploads/2024/08/1280/720/Trump-Harris.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.1529],"wgt":[460772220],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8264338791"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["23:47:01"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T23:47:01Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T23:43:06Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.651],"url":["https://dnyuz.com/2024/08/07/harris-and-walz-trade-fire-with-trump-running-mate-vance-at-dueling-events-in-blue-wall-states-battle/"],"title":["Harris and Walz trade fire with Trump running mate Vance at dueling events in Blue Wall states battle"],"body":["EAU CLAIRE, WI - Speaking in front of a sea of supporters in rural Wisconsin, Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday declared that \"the path to the White House wins right through this state and with your help, we will win in November.\"\n\nWisconsin is part of the so-called blue wall of states - along with neighboring Michigan as well as Pennsylvania - that the Democrats reliably won in presidential elections for nearly a quarter-century before former President Donald Trump narrowly carried them in capturing the White House eight years ago.\n\nBut in 2020, President Biden won back all three states with razor-thin margins as he defeated Trump, and the states remain extremely competitive as Harris and Trump face off in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nSo it was no surprise that Harris held her first rally with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz - her newly named running mate - in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, with stops Wednesday in Wisconsin and Michigan. And staying in close proximity was Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio.\n\nWalz took aim at Trump at Wednesday afternoon's rally, charging that the former President \"sees the world differently than we see it. He has no understanding of service. Because he's too busy serving himself again and again and again.\"\n\n\"This guy weakens our country to strengthen his own hands. He mocks our laws. He sows chaos and division amongst the people. And that's to say nothing of the job he did as president,\" Walz argued.\n\nHours earlier, Trump - in an interview on \"Fox and Friends\" - belittled the naming to the Democrats' ticket of Walz, a former high school teacher and football coach turned Democratic congressman in a red district before winning election and re-election as governor.\n\n\"I could not be more thrilled,\" Trump said when asked about the announcement from Harris on Tuesday that she chose Walz as her running mate, after also seriously considering Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona.\n\n\"I was shocked when, when it came down to the final two, that she didn't pick Shapiro. I was very surprised,\" Trump said.\n\nBut the naming of a running mate has been lucrative for the Harris campaign, which highlighted that it had hauled in $36 million in fundraising in the 24 hours since the Walz announcement.\n\nAt the rally, which the Harris campaign said attracted a crowd of over 12,000 people to a festival field amid farmland outside this small northwest Wisconsin city, Walz once again argued that Trump and Vance \"are creepy and weird as hell.\"\n\nVance, at a campaign event miles away, pushed back on the \"weird\" label, saying that he and Trump are \"normal guys who want to make this country great.\"\n\nIn a viral moment, Vance appeared to try and troll the vice president, as he approached Air Force Two at Chippewa Valley Regional Airport, where the senator's campaign plane was also parked.\n\n\"I figured that I would come by and get a good look at the plane because hopefully it's going to be my plane in a few months,\" Vance said in front of Air Force Two.\n\nAnd once again pointing out that Harris has yet to sit for a major interview or hold a press conference in the two and a half weeks since she replaced President Biden at the top of the Democrats' national ticket, Vance told reporters \"I also thought you guys may get lonely, because the VP doesn't answer questions from reporters.\"\n\nBiden dropped his re-election bid on July 21, after a disastrous debate performance against Trump in late June prompted increased questions over whether the 81-year-old president had the physical and mental abilities to serve another four years in the White House. It also sparked a rising chorus of calls from fellow Democrats for Biden to end his re-election bid.\n\nHarris didn't mention her boss at a large rally in Atlanta last week, nor did she or Walz reference the president at their rally Tuesday night in Philadelphia.\n\nBut Harris, in her sixth visit to Wisconsin so far this year, praised the president at the top of her comments.\n\n\"I want to bring greetings from our incredible president, Joe Biden,\" Harris said. \"He loves Wisconsin, and I know we are all deeply grateful for his lifetime of service to our nation and for all he continues to do.\"\n\nAfter the crowd broke out in a chant of \"Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe!,\" the vice president responded \"that's right.

Please try again later.\n\nDonald Trump's candidacy appeared all but destined for victory only weeks ago.\n\nHe rose defiant from the bullet graze of an attempted assassination, hoisting his fist in the air with a unified party at his back, a growing lead in the polls, dissolving criminal prosecutions -- and a struggling opponent, President Joe Biden, facing a full-blown revolt from within his own party. Trump mocked the idea of Vice President Kamala Harris becoming the new Democratic nominee, calling her \"so pathetic.\"\n\nAs staffers and allies gathered at the GOP nominating convention in Milwaukee last month, some privately discussed what administration jobs certain people wanted -- and predicted a landslide election. There was talk of spending money in states where Republicans haven't won in decades.\n\n\"At the convention, it was game over, and the Democrats realized that,\" said Richard Porter, a member of the Republican National Committee from Illinois. \"It felt like it was too good to be true, and it was. It's amazing how quickly they coalesced behind another candidate.\"\n\nTrump now finds himself back in a dead-even contest and with new signs of strain in his orbit. In the face of new Democratic momentum, he has grown increasingly upset about Harris's surging poll numbers and media coverage since replacing Biden on the ticket, complaining relentlessly and asking friends about how his campaign is performing, according to five people close to the campaign who like some others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.\n\n\"It's unfair that I beat him and now I have to beat her, too,\" Trump told an ally in a phone call last weekend.\n\nAllies have taken to finger-pointing over several events that seemingly went off the rails. Friends, Mar-a-Lago members and donors have logged their concerns with Trump, who then tells them to others, according to three people close to him. U.S. Senate allies and others are trying to get Trump focused on attacking Harris.\n\n\"We had a lot of good things happen in a row that were unsustainable, but we've hit a few speed bumps,\" Sen.

The former president remains ahead or tied in most of the swing states and continues to attract large crowds, with the cash on hand in total not far from the Democratic operation.\n\n\"The Trump campaign has never taken anything for granted and we always fight like we're the underdogs,\" Steven Cheung, a Trump spokesman, said in a statement. \"That's especially true after an assassination attempt on President Trump heading into Convention. Our sole job is to help President Trump win the election, and we're going to beat the brakes off the dangerously liberal Kamala-Walz ticket.\"\n\nBut for the first time since Trump established his dominance in the Republican nomination fight, his campaign has found itself publicly struggling to manage the daily news cycle as excitement around Harris has swelled along with her campaign activity. It has left people close to the campaign wondering why Trump and his team seemed ill-prepared, given that they had privately speculated for weeks after Biden's disastrous June 24 debate performance that Harris was going to be the nominee.\n\n\"What's happened in the last couple of weeks is we actually have a real race. This is a real presidential campaign. The Biden-Trump version of this was one event a week by each candidate, very rarely on the campaign trail and no real engagement,\" said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist who worked for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential effort. \"Now this is going to be one of those campaigns where strategies matter, resources matter, time matters, and there is not much room for error.\"\n\nPeople familiar with the campaign's inner workings say there is no staff freakout -- nor have there been dramatic fights between senior advisers in recent days, a hallmark of previous Trump campaigns where things went awry. Staff have been meeting to discuss polls, spending and upcoming events at the campaign's headquarters.\n\nCheung dismissed the allies and Trump advisers questioning the campaign's effectiveness as \"unnamed sources who have no idea what they are talking about and are doing nothing but helping Democrats.\"\n\n\"We have always thrived under pressure because we take our cues from President Trump,\" he said. \"With his leadership, we continue to prove everyone wrong. Anyone on the outside who continues to complain simply hasn't been battle-tested or gone through the adversity we have and come out on top.\"\n\nBut there is no doubt that some of his big advantages have faded.\n\nThe fundraising edge advantages Trump enjoyed for two months has been swallowed by Harris's $310 million fundraising surge in July -- about $170 million more than he announced for the same month. The much-larger Harris campaign now appears poised to take advantage of a new outpouring of grassroots energy, including more than 1.3 million voters who signed up for campaign events since she entered the race for president, according to her campaign.\n\nDespite going up with his first television spots of the general election, Trump and his allies are still being outspent in the battleground states. Over the first five days of August, Trump and his allies spent about $16.5 million on advertising, according to AdImpact, compared with about $23 million by Biden, Harris and their allies. From the beginning of March to early August, the Biden side has spent $309 million, compared with $110 million for the Trump side, according to the ad-tracking firm.\n\nWhile Trump has repeatedly said Republican Party officials only needed to focus on election integrity, he has begun hearing from outside allies that he does not have a significant ground game in key battleground states. He has grown annoyed with some of the media focus on his campaign staff, suggesting to others that his advisers get too much credit. Some advisers have urged him to spend more on digital advertising, saying he is being pummeled online.\n\nDemocrats and some in Trump's orbit have tried to highlight social media posts from Trump advisers and allies that they say show fear or bad messaging, while trying to stoke division in other ways. The Harris campaign has circulated posts and news releases about his staff, the pick of Sen. JD Vance (Ohio) as vice president, crowd size and other topics they say will grate on Trump and cause him to say controversial things.\n\n\"It's easy to live in Donald Trump's head,\" one Harris aide wrote, suggesting a story about crowd size now that Harris draws a crowd as big or larger than Trump's rallies.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, has been traveling more on the campaign trail than Trump, who is fundraising this week in Florida. Since the June 27 debate, Trump has held eight campaign rallies, besides his nominating convention, including events in Minnesota, Florida and Virginia, all outside the main battleground map.\n\nHarris will visit six states this week. Beyond interviews, the only event Trump has scheduled is a rally in Montana, a state where he is almost certain to win by double digits. Democrats wonder about the state of Trump's operation, while the former president's advisers note that he has campaigned for 21 months.\n\n\"Of all weeks when he has to blunt to momentum of Kamala Harris, you would have expected him to be very aggressive this week,\" said Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic strategist.\n\nTrump has begun asking friends and allies how his campaign staff is doing -- a question that some say could lead to staff changes, though the former president has not said he is planning that and has expressed support for campaign aides in recent days, a person close to him said. He has asked why Harris is raising so much more money than him, people familiar with the comments say. Trump has also repeatedly raised the large crowds that Harris is getting compared with Biden, people who have spoken to him said.\n\nSome Trump advisers grew alarmed last week when Kellyanne Conway arrived at his Bedminster, N.J., golf resort for a meeting and posted about it on X. Conway, who was the manager of his winning campaign in 2016, has a long relationship with Trump and has questioned some of the campaign's decisions but has not specified any personnel changes she thinks Trump should make, according to people who have spoken to her.\n\n\"The Kamala bump was a direct slump from the Biden slump,\" Conway said in an interview. \"There was nowhere for his successor to go but up in fundraising and enthusiasm. But this remains President Trump's election to lose. The electoral map and underlying fundamentals favor him.\"\n\nWhile accepting the Republican nomination at the convention, in his first speech since the shooting, advisers wanted him to give a sober and hopeful address about the future. He began by telling an emotional tale of his shooting but wandered off the teleprompter remarks dozens of times, stretching the speech \"past the point where it was productive,\" a campaign official said. Inside the arena, loyal attendees could be heard grumbling as they exited about how long the speech was. Several people close to Trump described it as a missed opportunity.\n\nInside his campaign, there have been frustrations about some of his other comments, people close to Trump say. When he went to a National Association of Black Journalists event in Chicago, he made unplanned remarks that suggested Harris was not really Black.\n\n\"I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black. So, I don't know, is she Indian or is she Black?\" Trump said falsely.\n\nWhile the campaign sought to defend his comments, Trump was frustrated by the event. He did not know that Harris was not going to appear, that the journalists were going to ask such tough questions and that there would be a fact-checking component to the event, one person who spoke with him about it said.\n\nHis team has sought to attack her on policy grounds while casting her as unfit. They have pushed arguments about rising numbers of undocumented immigrants crossing the southern border, inflation that rose while she was vice president, her record as a California politician and her comments backing certain liberal positions in the past, such as supporting the Green New Deal.\n\nAt his rally in Atlanta this weekend, Trump veered way off-script to attack Brian Kemp, a popular Georgia governor who would not seek to overturn the 2020 election for him. He spent a large portion of his comments slashing Kemp, who previously had considered appearing with the former president this fall. In the days after, Kemp's team have not heard from Trump's campaign, even as some outside advisers have sought a détente.\n\nErick Erickson, a conservative Georgia radio show host, said he was flooded with calls from suburban voters who were angry with Trump's attacks on Kemp. Ericksen said he still believed Trump will probably win Georgia.\n\n\"All attacking Kemp does is remind people why they didn't like him,\" he said. \"He makes it closer than it should be. That's the problem. You're not going to have Kemp on the campaign trail for him, which you could have had.\"\n\nCheung, the Trump spokesman, dismissed concerns expressed by allies about the campaign and its messaging. \"Our message discipline is second to none,\" he said. \"It's why President Trump was able to take out Joe Biden in the debate, it's why we've been so successful thus far, and it'll be why President Trump will win the election.\"\n\nSeveral people close to the campaign said there was an ongoing effort to get Trump to focus on attacking Harris and slashing Democrats. Trump enjoyed an advantage of two percentage points over Biden in a Washington Post average of national polls taken in July, before the president bowed out. Harris is polling four percentage points ahead of Biden's number in a Post average of national polls since then, giving her a one-point edge over Trump.\n\n\"This is really Trump's race to lose,\" Graham said. \"I hope we'll get more focused on prosecuting the case against her. I think he was frustrated originally, but over the last couple days, we've had good conversations and I think we have the wind at our back.\"\n\nA Tuesday afternoon post from Trump on his Truth Social media site -- which included a number of nicknames, falsehoods and baseless accusations -- suggested he was still steaming.\n\n\"What are the chances that Crooked Joe Biden, the WORST President in the history of the U.S., whose Presidency was Unconstitutionally STOLEN from him by Kamabla, Barrack HUSSEIN Obama, Crazy Nancy Pelosi, Shifty Adam Schiff, Cryin' Chuck Schumer, and others on the Lunatic Left, CRASHES the Democrat National Convention and tries to take back the Nomination, beginning with challenging me to another DEBATE,\" the post read. \"He feels that he made a historically tragic mistake by handing over the U.S. Presidency, a COUP, to the people in the World he most hates, and he wants it back, NOW!!!\"\n\nClara Ence Morse contributed to this report."],"source":{"uri":["washingtonpost.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Washington Post"]},"authors":[{"uri":["josh_dawsey@washingtonpost.com"],"name":["Josh Dawsey"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]},{"uri":["michael_scherer@washingtonpost.com"],"name":["Michael Scherer"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YTPDNHXOAVXRDI2XB6FDPMAGKM.jpg&w=1440"],"eventUri":["eng-9792426"],"sentiment":[-0.1608],"wgt":[460770200],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8264336605"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["23:41:05"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T23:41:05Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T23:40:19Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["http://fromthetrenchesworldreport.com/kamalas-vp-pick-tim-walz-signed-pro-pedophilia-legislation-into-law-as-mn-governor/327224"],"title":["Kamala's VP Pick Tim Walz Signed Pro-Pedophilia Legislation Into Law As MN Governor | From the Trenches World Report"],"body":["Given that Kamala Harris seemed so set on choosing Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro as her vice presidential candidate that a leaked video even apparently revealed his selection, the complete about-face her campaign has taken by choosing Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate instead has become the latest surprise in the whirlwind that the build up to the 2024 Presidential Election has become. However, a cursory review of Walz record shows that his selection should come as no surprise at all as he is the embodiment of the progressive policy making destroying America.\n\nFrom his tenure during the BLM riots of 2020 in the epicenter of the race war as the governor the state where George Floyd died and Derek Chauvin and his colleagues were later convicted, to being head of a state with the largest population of Somali immigrants in the country at a time where the broader Muslim population is at odds with the Democratic Party over Israel's war in Gaza, Walz provides Harris and her progressive agenda with valuable political capital that they so desperately need.\n\nOne bill signed into law by Walz as governor shows just how steadfast he is in support of that agenda, even when it takes form in its most perverse manifestations. As Governor Of Minnesota, Tim Walz signed a bill into law that paves the way to recognize pedophilia as a sexual orientation. In doing so, the law could be used to extend civil rights protections to pedophiles under Minnesota's existing human rights code.\n\nThe codification of this depraved decision was legislated in Minnesota's Take Pride Act which took effect on August 1st, 2023 after Walz signed it into law. The bill was introduced to the State Of Minnesota House Of Representatives as HF No. 1655 by Leigh Finke, the first openly transgender legislator in the state's history. The bill aimed to amend existing Minnesota statutes which defined a person's sexual orientation under state law. Previously Minnesota's definition of sexual orientation included language reading \"'Sexual orientation' does not include a physical attraction or sexual attachment to children by an adult.\" but Finke's proposed amendment to that existing statute removed that exclusionary language. As such, the Take Price Act revised the legal definition of 'sexual orientation' under Minnesota law in a manner that would not exclude pedophilia from being recognized and afforded protections under existing human rights legislation.\n\nThe bill was then sent to committee and ultimately approved after multiple revisions, none of which modified Finke's removal of language explicitly excluding pedophilia as a sexual orientation under Minnesota law. Ultimately, the amendments proposed by Finke would be passed with the term sexual orientation being re-defined as \"to whom someone is, or is perceived of as being, emotionally, physically, or sexually attracted to based on sex or gender identity. A person may be attracted to men, women, both, neither, or to people who are genderqueer, androgynous, or have other gender identities.\" The amendments made by the Take Pride Act became part of SF 2909, Minnesota's Judiciary And Public Safety Bill, which was signed by Walz on May 29th, 2023.\n\nFollowing its passage, the pro-pedophilia legislation became highlighted as a seminal achievement in advancing the civil rights of Minnesota's LGBT+ community. Following Walz's nomination as Kamala Harris' vice presidential candidate, The architect of the Take Pride Act, Representative Leigh Finke, took to ABC News to wax poetic about the governors history as an LGBT+ advocate. Finke's remarks included highlighting Walz longstanding support of the community, going back to his days as a high school teacher in which he served as the advisor for the gay-straight alliance whilst simultaneously being the school's football coach. Finke would go on to convey how Walz influence was integral to Minnesota's creation of a queer caucus, its election of 11 new LGBT+ members to the Minnesota House Of Representatives in 2022, and the passage of legislation sponsored by Finke which made Minnesota a transgender refuge state.\n\nSince its passage, Finke has contended that the amendments made by the Take Pride Act do not serve the interest of pedophiles. \"The bill updates outdated language that incorrectly ties pedophilia to a person's sexual orientation,\" Finke said in an email to USA Today in 2023, adding \"Nothing in the bill changes or weakens any crimes against children, or the state's ability to prosecute those who break the law. Of course, pedophilia is not a sexual orientation - which is why the language never should have been included in the statutory definition in the first place.\" An amendment to the bill was also added which states \"The physical or sexual attachment to children by an adult is not a protected class under this chapter.\" However, the latter remark Finke made is paradoxical considering the language which explicitly states that pedophilia is not recognized as a sexual orientation is what is being removed by the changes to the statutory definition that the Take Pride Act makes.\n\nWhile the bill does not affirmatively make pedophiles a protected class, it does remove the legal exclusion of pedophilia as a sexual orientation. In turn, Minnesota law provides civil rights protections to its residents based on their sexual orientation which now legally does not exclude pedophilia. The Minnesota Human Rights Act provides protections to Minnesotans against discrimination on the basis of their sexual orientation. The law allows those discriminated on the basis of their sexual orientation to sue for damages. In addition to providing those protections, the MHRA became the first state law in the nation to expressly ban discrimination against transgender people when it was passed in 1993. Since then, efforts from the likes of people such as Rep. Finke have sought to use the law as a political vehicle to advance their own legislation.\n\nThough Finke contends the MHRA protections would not be extended to pedophiles given the additional amendment made to the Take Pride Act prohibiting those with \"physical or sexual attachment\" to children from being a protected class, the plain meaning of that amendment's statutory construction could be construed to differentiate between physical or sexual attachment and physical or sexual attraction. The provision in the law advancing its liberal application could be construed to extend the MHRA protections to pedophiles under that basis. Given the amorphous view of the progressive agenda in which concepts like sexual orientation and gender identity has a seemingly infinite amount of labels, contrived sexual orientations like pedo-romantic, ephebophilia, minor-attacted persons, etc. among the endless slew of degenerate terminology leaves far too much uncertainty around how sexual orientation can now be contrived under Minnesota law.\n\nBy signing the Take Pride Act into law, Governor Tim Walz has shown his unrestrained commitment to advance extremely progressive policy making. That commitment highlights the agenda he has supported and political allies he has been willing to make in order to vault himself into the greatest heights of his political career thus far. In doing so, Walz devotion to a progressive agenda aimed at eroding the cohesion of traditional social norms to the extent that it would serve the interest of pedophiles succinctly summarizes his wanton abandonment of morality for the pursuit of political power. Given that Walz is running on the same ticket as a woman who is the central political figure being advanced by a soft coup which saw her installed as the Democratic Party's presidential nominee, bypassing the primary process in a manner diametrically opposed to the democratic will of the people, it should come as no surprise that Harris would select someone just as, if not even more depraved as she is to be her running mate."],"source":{"uri":["fromthetrenchesworldreport.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["From the Trenches World Report"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/GUUhw4pW8AEG_f4.jpeg?itok=q-YVU336"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[-0.2],"wgt":[460770065],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8264334601"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["23:39:08"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T23:39:08Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T23:37:22Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/who-is-leading-polls-president-2024-presidential-polling-harris-trump-poll"],"title":["Who is leading the polls for president in 2024?"],"body":["WASHINGTON - With just 90 days to go until the 2024 presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris announced who would be running on the ticket with her.\n\nSpeculation about who Harris would choose as her running mate began within days of President Joe Biden's announcement that he was dropping out of the race and instead endorsing his VP, and with that came a spate of polls considering who would best bolster Harris' chances against former President Donald Trump.\n\nHarris selected Minnesota Gov.

Tim Walz - her newly named running mate - in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, with stops Wednesday in Wisconsin and Michigan. And staying in close proximity was Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS AND HER NEWLY NAMED RUNNING MATE KICK OFF A BATTLEGROUND STATE SWING\n\nWalz took aim at Trump at Wednesday afternoon's rally, charging that the former President \"sees the world differently than we see it. He has no understanding of service. Because he's too busy serving himself again and again and again.\"\n\n\"This guy weakens our country to strengthen his own hands. He mocks our laws. He sows chaos and division amongst the people. And that's to say nothing of the job he did as president,\" Walz argued.\n\nHours earlier, Trump - in an interview on \"Fox and Friends\" - belittled the naming to the Democrats' ticket of Walz, a former high school teacher and football coach turned Democratic congressman in a red district before winning election and re-election as governor.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT HARRIS NAMES MINNESOTA GOV TIM WALZ AS HER RUNNING MATE\n\n\"I could not be more thrilled,\" Trump said when asked about the announcement from Harris on Tuesday that she chose Walz as her running mate, after also seriously considering Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona.\n\n\"I was shocked when, when it came down to the final two, that she didn't pick Shapiro. I was very surprised,\" Trump said.\n\nBut the naming of a running mate has been lucrative for the Harris campaign, which highlighted that it had hauled in $36 million in fundraising in the 24 hours since the Walz announcement.\n\nAt the rally, which the Harris campaign said attracted a crowd of over 12,000 people to a festival field amid farmland outside this small northwest Wisconsin city, Walz once again argued that Trump and Vance \"are creepy and weird as hell.\"\n\nVance, at a campaign event miles away, pushed back on the \"weird\" label, saying that he and Trump are \"normal guys who want to make this country great.\"\n\nIn a viral moment, Vance appeared to try and troll the vice president, as he approached Air Force Two at Chippewa Valley Regional Airport, where the senator's campaign plane was also parked.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I figured that I would come by and get a good look at the plane because hopefully it's going to be my plane in a few months,\" Vance said in front of Air Force Two.\n\nAnd once again pointing out that Harris has yet to sit for a major interview or hold a press conference in the two and a half weeks since she replaced President Biden at the top of the Democrats' national ticket, Vance told reporters \"I also thought you guys may get lonely, because the VP doesn't answer questions from reporters.\"\n\nBiden dropped his re-election bid on July 21, after a disastrous debate performance against Trump in late June prompted increased questions over whether the 81-year-old president had the physical and mental abilities to serve another four years in the White House. It also sparked a rising chorus of calls from fellow Democrats for Biden to end his re-election bid.\n\nHarris didn't mention her boss at a large rally in Atlanta last week, nor did she or Walz reference the president at their rally Tuesday night in Philadelphia.\n\nBut Harris, in her sixth visit to Wisconsin so far this year, praised the president at the top of her comments.\n\n\"I want to bring greetings from our incredible president, Joe Biden,\" Harris said. \"He loves Wisconsin, and I know we are all deeply grateful for his lifetime of service to our nation and for all he continues to do.\"\n\nAfter the crowd broke out in a chant of \"Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe!,\" the vice president responded \"that's right.

You called up big numbers, and the big numbers knocked them out so fast it was like bowling pins.\"\n\nThis contrasts sharply with the attacks that Republicans, including Trump and his allies, have launched against Walz over his response to the protests. They have accused the governor of being \"dangerously liberal\" and mishandling the situation by being slow to deploy the National Guard.\n\nThe Trump campaign has even claimed that it was the former president's suggestion for Walz to call in the National Guard, which the Harris campaign has categorically denied.\n\n\"Governor Walz allowed Minneapolis to burn for days, despite President Trump's offer to deploy soldiers and cries for help from the liberal Mayor of Minneapolis,\" Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to ABC News.\n\nHowever, the audio recording paints a different picture, putting a \"serious damper\" on the Trump campaign's claims that Walz was soft on crime and mishandled the 2020 protests.\n\nThe revelations come as Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota, has been selected as Kamala Harris's running mate for the 2024 presidential election. Republicans have wasted no time in attacking Walz's record, accusing him of everything from antisemitism to being \"far left.\"\n\nBut as the 2024 campaign season kicks into high gear, the audio recording of Trump's praise for Walz's handling of the protests could undermine the GOP's efforts to paint the Minnesota governor as a liability for the Democratic ticket."],"source":{"uri":["dimsumdaily.hk"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Dimsum Daily"]},"authors":[{"uri":["dimsumdaily_hong_kong@dimsumdaily.hk"],"name":["Dimsumdaily Hong Kong"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://cdn.dimsumdaily.hk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/08070653/Trump-3433.jpg"],"eventUri":["eng-9795783"],"sentiment":[-0.0118],"wgt":[460768335],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8264313331"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["23:09:19"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T23:09:19Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T23:08:33Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.benzinga.com/general/politics/24/08/40238970/bill-ackman-says-democrats-losing-2024-election-would-be-best-thing-for-party-despite-growing-su"],"title":["Bill Ackman Says Democrats Losing 2024 Election Would Be 'Best Thing' For Party Despite Growing Support For Harris"],"body":["The hedge fund manager previously suggested Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Vivek Ramaswamy and Jamie Dimon as more viable candidates over Trump.\n\nBillionaire investor Bill Ackman offered a scathing take on what one political party should hope for in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nWhat Happened: Ackman, who supports former President and Republican nominee Donald Trump, posted on X.com: \"The best thing that can happen for long-term supporters of the Democratic Party is for this election to be a massive loss for the party. That's the only way the party will reform itself.\"\n\nAckman, who recently reneged on a plan to bring his U.S. closed-end fund public, often disparages Democrats on social media. The latest slight comes as Vice President and presumptive Democratic nominee Kamala Harris raised over $41 million in 24 hours after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz was added to the ticket.\n\nSo far, Harris raised $310 million in total (66% of donations can from first-time contributors).\n\nShe is also ahead of Trump by four points in the latest Morning Consult poll and gained endorsements from hundreds of big-name investors, including billionaire Mark Cuban.\n\nTrump and his running mate, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, have also gained support from major investors and company founders, including Elon Musk.\n\nAckman's gripe with the Democratic Party stems from allegations that it shut out competition during the primary. Recall how he pledged $1 million to a long-shot candidate, Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, to run against President Joe Biden.\n\nPhilips dropped out of the race after he lost every state primary, including Minnesota, to Biden.\n\nThe Democratic Party \"misled the public about the health of the president,\" Ackman said Tuesday. \"When something is totally and fundamentally broken, the best thing to do is to start over. We won't see a reboot of the party unless it takes a massive loss in this election. Please vote accordingly.\"\n\nIn a separate post, Ackman acknowledged a thought about founders not being allowed to share their political views:\n\n\"Sad but true. Imagine if we could live in a world where people could share their political views without fear of career damaging consequences.\"\n\nDid You Know: Congress Is Making Huge Investments. Get Tips On What They Bought And Sold Ahead Of The 2024 Election With Our Easy-to-Use Tool\n\nAckman Got His Wish\n\nFor months, Ackman pushed for the Democratic Party to replace Biden with a candidate who can compete against Trump.\n\nLast September, Ackman called on Biden to make way for \"a flurry of alternative candidates,\" suggesting Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Vivek Ramaswamy and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon as options.\n\nA potential rematch of the 2020 presidential election between Biden and Trump was \"not the best option for America,\" Ackman said at the time. \"It would be great for us to be brought together by a more centrist candidate that members of both parties can vote for.\"\n\nIn January, Ackman again argued that the Democratic Party should pick a new candidate.\n\n\"If the Democrat party wants to have a chance of putting up a candidate who can compete with Trump, it needs to quickly get behind a strong, credible contender for President, and Biden needs to step aside,\" Ackman said.\n\nAckman's wish came true when Biden withdrew from the 2024 election and endorsed Harris for president on July 21. Just two days later, Harris secured the backing of a majority of the Democratic delegates.\n\nAnd now the hedge fund manager says Democrats should hope to lose the 2024 election against Trump, the Republican candidate he \"formally\" endorsed on July 13.\n\n\"I assure you that I have made this decision carefully, rationally, and by relying on as much empirical data as possible,\" Ackman tweeted.\n\nAckman said his endorsement shouldn't be a surprise based on his \"supportive posts of Trump\" and his \"criticisms of Biden.\"\n\nBut Ackman wasn't always supportive of the current GOP nominee. On Jan. 6, 2021, Ackman tweeted at Trump, urging him \"to resign and apologize to all Americans.\"\n\nCheck This Out:\n\nLawmakers Made Huge Investments This Year.

However, a cursory review of Walz record shows that his selection should come as no surprise at all as he is the embodiment of the progressive policy making destroying America. From his tenure during the BLM riots of 2020 in the epicenter of the race war as the governor the state where George Floyd died and Derek Chauvin and his colleagues were later convicted, to being head of a state with the largest population of Somali immigrants in the country at a time where the broader Muslim population is at odds with the Democratic Party over Israel's war in Gaza, Walz provides Harris and her progressive agenda with valuable political capital that they so desperately need.\n\nOne bill signed into law by Walz as governor shows just how steadfast he is in support of that agenda, even when it takes form in its most perverse manifestations. As Governor Of Minnesota, Tim Walz signed a bill into law that paves the way to recognize pedophilia as a sexual orientation. In doing so, the law could be used to extend civil rights protections to pedophiles under Minnesota's existing human rights code.\n\nThe codification of this depraved decision was legislated in Minnesota's Take Pride Act which took effect on August 1st, 2023 after Walz signed it into law. The bill was introduced to the State Of Minnesota House Of Representatives as HF No. 1655 by Leigh Finke, the first openly transgender legislator in the state's history. The bill aimed to amend existing Minnesota statutes which defined a person's sexual orientation under state law. Previously Minnesota's definition of sexual orientation included language reading \"'Sexual orientation' does not include a physical attraction or sexual attachment to children by an adult.\" but Finke's proposed amendment to that existing statute removed that exclusionary language. As such, the Take Price Act revised the legal definition of 'sexual orientation' under Minnesota law in a manner that would not exclude pedophilia from being recognized and afforded protections under existing human rights legislation.\n\nThe bill was then sent to committee and ultimately approved after multiple revisions, none of which modified Finke's removal of language explicitly excluding pedophilia as a sexual orientation under Minnesota law. Ultimately, the amendments proposed by Finke would be passed with the term sexual orientation being re-defined as \"to whom someone is, or is perceived of as being, emotionally, physically, or sexually attracted to based on sex or gender identity. A person may be attracted to men, women, both, neither, or to people who are genderqueer, androgynous, or have other gender identities.\" The amendments made by the Take Pride Act became part of SF 2909, Minnesota's Judiciary And Public Safety Bill, which was signed by Walz on May 29th, 2023.\n\nFollowing its passage, the pro-pedophilia legislation became highlighted as a seminal achievement in advancing the civil rights of Minnesota's LGBT+ community. Following Walz's nomination as Kamala Harris' vice presidential candidate, The architect of the Take Pride Act, Representative Leigh Finke, took to ABC News to wax poetic about the governors history as an LGBT+ advocate. Finke's remarks included highlighting Walz longstanding support of the community, going back to his days as a high school teacher in which he served as the advisor for the gay-straight alliance whilst simultaneously being the school's football coach. Finke would go on to convey how Walz influence was integral to Minnesota's creation of a queer caucus, its election of 11 new LGBT+ members to the Minnesota House Of Representatives in 2022, and the passage of legislation sponsored by Finke which made Minnesota a transgender refuge state.\n\nSince its passage, Finke has contended that the amendments made by the Take Pride Act do not serve the interest of pedophiles. \"The bill updates outdated language that incorrectly ties pedophilia to a person's sexual orientation,\" Finke said in an email to USA Today in 2023, adding \"Nothing in the bill changes or weakens any crimes against children, or the state's ability to prosecute those who break the law. Of course, pedophilia is not a sexual orientation - which is why the language never should have been included in the statutory definition in the first place.\" An amendment to the bill was also added which states \"The physical or sexual attachment to children by an adult is not a protected class under this chapter.\" However, the latter remark Finke made is paradoxical considering the language which explicitly states that pedophilia is not recognized as a sexual orientation is what is being removed by the changes to the statutory definition that the Take Pride Act makes.\n\nWhile the bill does not affirmatively make pedophiles a protected class, it does remove the legal exclusion of pedophilia as a sexual orientation. In turn, Minnesota law provides civil rights protections to its residents based on their sexual orientation which now legally does not exclude pedophilia. The Minnesota Human Rights Act provides protections to Minnesotans against discrimination on the basis of their sexual orientation. The law allows those discriminated on the basis of their sexual orientation to sue for damages. In addition to providing those protections, the MHRA became the first state law in the nation to expressly ban discrimination against transgender people when it was passed in 1993. Since then, efforts from the likes of people such as Rep. Finke have sought to use the law as a political vehicle to advance their own legislation.\n\nThough Finke contends the MHRA protections would not be extended to pedophiles given the additional amendment made to the Take Pride Act prohibiting those with \"physical or sexual attachment\" to children from being a protected class, the plain meaning of that amendment's statutory construction could be construed to differentiate between physical or sexual attachment and physical or sexual attraction. The provision in the law advancing its liberal application could be construed to extend the MHRA protections to pedophiles under that basis. Given the amorphous view of the progressive agenda in which concepts like sexual orientation and gender identity has a seemingly infinite amount of labels, contrived sexual orientations like pedo-romantic, ephebophilia, minor-attacted persons, etc. among the endless slew of degenerate terminology leaves far too much uncertainty around how sexual orientation can now be contrived under Minnesota law.\n\nBy signing the Take Pride Act into law, Governor Tim Walz has shown his unrestrained commitment to advance extremely progressive policy making. That commitment highlights the agenda he has supported and political allies he has been willing to make in order to vault himself into the greatest heights of his political career thus far. In doing so, Walz devotion to a progressive agenda aimed at eroding the cohesion of traditional social norms to the extent that it would serve the interest of pedophiles succinctly summarizes his wanton abandonment of morality for the pursuit of political power. Given that Walz is running on the same ticket as a woman who is the central political figure being advanced by a soft coup which saw her installed as the Democratic Party's presidential nominee, bypassing the primary process in a manner diametrically opposed to the democratic will of the people, it should come as no surprise that Harris would select someone just as, if not even more depraved as she is to be her running mate."],"source":{"uri":["zerohedge.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Zero Hedge"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/contributor-teasers/2024/08/GUUeMBJWwAAtGBQ.jpeg?h=7c2037c5&itok=F7qTD3Ql"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[-0.3882],"wgt":[460767114],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["2024-08-447432432"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["22:47:04"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T22:47:04Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T22:46:52Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.wlsam.com/news/pelosi-blames-republicans-for-attack-on-husband/"],"title":["Pelosi Blames Republicans for Attack on Husband"],"body":["Former House Speaker Rep.

That 2 1/2-to-3-month timespan will likely be crucial in determining the fate the US Dollar.\n\nAs for this current moment, unless certain major geopolitical events were to occur prior to election season, causing price to potentially break through prematurely, expect price to continue consolidating within the triangle pattern."],"source":{"uri":["tradingview.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["TradingView"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://s3.tradingview.com/u/uf3T4O1m_big.png"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.302],"wgt":[460766046],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["2024-08-447426194"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["22:33:30"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T22:33:30Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T22:31:00Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.6667],"url":["https://www.wisn.com/article/wisconsin-marquette-poll-trump-harris-close-jd-vance-unpopular/61818503"],"title":["Marquette poll: Trump, Harris in close race; JD Vance favorability low"],"body":["The latest Marquette Law School Poll shows a close race in Wisconsin between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump for the 2024 presidential election.The poll, conducted between July 24 and Aug. 1, surveyed 877 registered voters and 801 likely voters, revealing a statistical tie in both head-to-head and multicandidate matchups.Head-to-Head MatchupRegistered voters: Harris 49%, Trump 50%.Likely voters: Harris 50%, Trump 49%.

Harris: Presidential Odds And Betting Markets Show Near Toss-Up  --  But This Candidate Has The Edge In 2024 Election"],"body":["A look at the betting odds and what a leading prediction market shows.\n\nThe presidential odds and betting markets show a fairly even head-to-head matchup between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nHere's a look at who has the edge and how the markets have shifted in recent months.\n\nWhat Happened: With President Joe Biden dropping out of the 2024 election, Vice President Harris quickly became the frontrunner for the Democratic Party and will now face off against Trump in less than three months.\n\nThe betting odds are near even between the two candidates at Bet365, as reported by Covers. Trump has the slight edge at odds of -125 with Harris ranking close behind at +100.\n\nBased on the betting odds, the implied odds of winning are 55.6% for Trump and 50% for Harris. Ranking behind the two leading candidates is third-party candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at odds of +5,000 and an implied 2% chance of winning. Following the three candidates are other names like Nikki Haley, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, J.D. Vance and Gavin Newsom, who are unlikely to be running or win the election.\n\nThis marks a shift in the betting odds from July. After an assassination attempt on Trump in Pennsylvania, his odds hit -250 as a larger favorite with Biden listed at +500 and Harris at +800.\n\nFollowing the first presidential debate, Trump had odds of -175, with Harris at +400 topping the odds of Biden at +800 before his withdrawal from the race.\n\nIn late June, Trump was listed with odds of -188 with Biden at +350 and Harris significantly behind at +2,200.\n\nThe current odds are most similar to the month of May, which saw Trump as a -110 favorite and Biden closely behind at +130.\n\nKeep in mind that back in January 2021, it was Harris who was the favorite to win the 2024 election with odds of +350 based on the plan that Biden would not run for re-election. Biden and Trump trailed Harris at the time at odds of +400 and +650, respectively.\n\nPrediction market Polymarket, which calls itself the world's largest prediction market, offers betting on items in categories such as politics, sports, cryptocurrency, pop culture and more.\n\nUsers deposit to Polygon MATIC/USD using USDC USDC/USD and can deposit with Ethereum ETH/USD. Winning wagers cash out at $1 and losing markets end up worthless.\n\nThe prediction market for the winner of the 2024 presidential election has attracted over $539 million in wagers on Polymarket. Here are the current odds:\n\nDonald Trump: 51%\n\nKamala Harris: 48%\n\nSimilar to sportsbooks, the prediction market shows a near toss-up between the two candidates.\n\nCheck This Out:\n\nLawmakers Made Huge Investments This Year. Get Tips On What They Bought And Sold Ahead Of The 2024 Election With Our Easy-to-Use Tool\n\nWhy It's Important: The improving betting odds for Harris and Trump's odds worsening come as election polls are showing Harris closing the gap and re-gaining support lost by Biden. In some polls, Harris is leading Trump.\n\nA recent Morning Consult poll showed Harris with a four-point lead over Trump among nationally registered voters. A Morning Consult/Bloomberg poll of voters in seven key swing states showed Harris with an overall lead of 48% to 47%. Harris is leading Trump in five of the seven states, tied in one, and trails Trump in one.\n\nThese seven swing states represent 93 electoral votes collectively and could decide the 2024 election. Six of the seven swing states were won by Biden in the 2020 election, with five slipping from Trump's win in 2016.\n\nHarris has also shown a lead among Independent voters and young voters in a recent poll, which could be two key voter groups that decide the 2024 election.\n\nBetting odds for Trump hit highs after the assassination attempt and after Biden's stumble during the first presidential debate. With Harris now taking Trump on and polls showing a close battle, sportsbooks and prediction markets show a close battle as well.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nCongress Is Making Huge Investments.

They also co-hosted SNL together in 2022, which became the most-watched episode of the season with 5.1 million viewers.\n\nWhile Martin was never a cast member of the popular NBC sketch series, Short was a regular on its 10th season airing from 1984 to 1985.\n\nHowever, the Pink Panther actor has hosted the show 16 times - more than anyone else bar 17-time host Alec Baldwin.\n\nMartin would have joined Maya Rudolph, who is set to reprise her popular impersonation of Harris for the show's 50th season.\n\nRudolph, who debuted her portrayal of the VP during a 2019 episode, won an Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her performance. She later returned as Harris for the show's 46th season in 2021.\n\nOn Tuesday, Harris and Walz made their first appearance together as the Democratic party's official nominees. Appearing before a 12,000-strong crowd at Temple University in Pennsylvania, Harris praised Walz's roots as a teacher, veteran, congressman and governor responsible for policies like free school lunches for kids and protections to codify abortion rights.\n\nWalz delivered a fiery speech of his own, balancing calls to bring back \"joy\" to politics with attacks on the GOP campaign.\n\n\"Like all regular people I grew up with in the heartland, JD [Vance] studied at Yale, had his career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, and then wrote a bestseller trashing that community,\" he said.\n\n\"That's not what Middle America is.

Their statement and full press release was as follows:\n\n(Dawes County Sheriff's Office)\n\nAt the time of his arrest, Walz was working as a high school teacher and football coach in Nebraska. According to the police report, on September 23, 1995, at approximately 9:30 p.m., the officer recorded Walz going 96 mph in a 55 mph zone. \"A strong odor of alcoholic beverage was detected emitting from Mr. Walz breath and person,\" the report read. After failing both the field sobriety test and a preliminary breath test, Walz was taken to the hospital to get a blood test before they transported him to the Dawes County Jail. He later pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of reckless driving. According to Alpha News sourced court transcripts, Walz immediately reported the incident to his high school principle and offered to resign, but the principle talked him out of it. Walz paid $200 in fines.\n\n(Alpha News)\n\nWe reached out to Walz's office seeking comment, and will update this story is we receive a response.\n\nIn sum, because the county responsible for arresting Walz confirmed the photo's authenticity, we rate this claim \"True.\""],"source":{"uri":["snopes.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Snopes"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://mediaproxy.snopes.com/width/1200/https://media.snopes.com/2024/08/walz_mugshot_feature_photo.jpg"],"eventUri":["eng-9795352"],"sentiment":[-0.1294],"wgt":[460765274],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8264271180"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["22:16:42"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T22:16:42Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T22:16:03Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.6],"url":["https://www.snopes.com//fact-check/kamala-harris-wore-62k-necklace/"],"title":["Kamala Harris Wore $62K Necklace While Soliciting Donations?"],"body":["While it's true that a Tiffany & Co. necklace that resembles the one worn by Harris exists and is listed for purchase at $62,000, and Vogue at one point reported that she was wearing a Tiffany & Co. necklace, there was no definitive evidence to confirm, nor deny, that Harris was wearing the $62,000 version of the gold chainlink necklace. We're waiting to hear back from Tiffany & Co. and Harris' camp, and will update this article if we receive a response.\n\nOn Aug. 1, 2024, an X user posted a claim that U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris -- the Democratic Party's nominee for the 2024 U.S. presidential election -- was seen wearing a necklace worth more than $60,000 in a video soliciting donations for her campaign.\n\nThe X post, which had garnered more than 10.5 million views as of this writing, read:\n\nKamala Harris allegedly got caught wearing a $62,000 necklace while asking people to donate. This image has been surfacing on social media. What do you think?\n\nThe post included a split-screen image, with a screenshot of the video on the left purportedly showing Harris wearing the expensive jewelry and a screen grab on the right showing a Tiffany & Co. website page where the alleged necklace was available for purchase.\n\nWhile it's true that a Tiffany & Co. necklace that resembles the one worn by Harris exists and is listed for purchase at $62,000, and Vogue at one point reported that she was wearing a Tiffany & Co. necklace, there was no definitive evidence to confirm, nor deny, that Harris was wearing the $62,000 version of the gold chainlink necklace while soliciting for campaign donations.\n\nSnopes reached out to Harris' team asking to establish whether social media users had correctly identified the necklace as the piece from Tiffany & Co.'s website, but the campaign did not immediately respond to our request for comment.\n\nWe also reached out to Tiffany & Co.'s public relations office to see if the company could confirm, or deny, whether the in-question necklace was its product. We and will update this article if we receive a response.\n\nThe screenshot on the left of the split-screen image was taken from a video posted on Harris' Facebook account on July 25, 2024. The caption read: \"Donate now. Election Day will be here before we know it. Can I count on you to make a donation today while there's still time?\"\n\nIn the 35-second video, Harris asked for donations \"today\" to support her 2024 presidential election campaign: \"Not tomorrow, not next week. Today is the day I hope you will donate to support our movement. Because the truth is, time is running out. We're in the final lap of this race, and Election Day will be here before you and I know it.\"\n\nThat was not the first time Harris wore what appeared to be the necklace in question. On June 27, 2024, she wore the piece (or one that looked similar to it) during a broadcast interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper:\n\nShe also wore the style months earlier, on March 7, 2024, during President Joe Biden's State of the Union address. In March, the same day that the State of the Union (SOTU) took place in Washington, D.C., fashion and style magazine Vogue reported the necklace Harris wore during the SOTU was indeed a Tiffany & Co. piece. Vogue's reporting did not specify the necklace's style or price.\n\nIt was unknown whether the necklace Harris wore at the SOTU -- a piece Vogue said was Tiffany & Co. -- was the same piece she wore in the in-question video soliciting donations for her presidential campaign. From photos and still images of the video, they looked similar, if not nearly identical.\n\nThe Tiffany & Co. product is not the only necklace with the same chain-linked design, however. Snopes found similar-looking pieces through a Google search using the Tiffany & Co. description of \"Bold Graduated Link Necklace.\" For example, an 18-karat, gold U-link chain hardware necklace is for sale for a fraction of the Tiffany & Co. price on various websites. Another such necklace retails for $35:\n\n(1oaks)\n\nDespite Vogue reporting in early March that Harris wore a Tiffany & Co. necklace that looked similar to the one seen in the July 25 video, many facts were unconfirmed, including whether they were the same necklace. If so, it was also unknown whether they were purchased from Tiffany & Co. for $62,000.

Now, the Harris-Walz campaign has embraced yet another internet trend with open arms: camo hats.\n\nMillennials and Gen Z-ers make up a huge voter bloc, so it's absolutely essential that candidates, whether that be Kamala Harris, Donald Trump, or god forbid, even RFK Jr., win over the hearts of Americans between the ages of 18-43 if they have any hope of snagging the presidency. And so far -- to use a little TikTok lingo here -- Harris and Walz are absolutely slaying.\n\nTheir latest effort went viral Tuesday when the Harris-Walz campaign began selling camouflage trucker hats listing both of the candidates' names in bright orange font. For those who aren't chronically online, Walz is the internet's new fave \"midwest princess\" -- a nod to pop singer Chappell Roan's debut studio album -- having been born and raised in small-town Nebraska.\n\nHester Leyser, Director of Strategic Planning for the DNC, took to Twitter (X) to show off the new design, where she all but confirmed that the hat was, in fact, inspired by similar merch sold by Roan.\n\nAccording to an official spokesperson for Team Harris (per The Washington Post), the initial run of 3 thousand hats sold out in just 30 minutes, raising over $1 million for the campaign. The \"Femininomenon\" singer herself responded to the new merch on social media shortly after, writing, \"is this real\" alongside a photo of the hat. So...is this technically an endorsement?\n\nAppealing to young voters by leaning into pop culture trends has proven successful for the Harris-Walz campaign in the past, as many responded enthusiastically to Charli XCX's July tweet, \"kamala IS brat.\" As for the camo hat, Business Insider accurately dubbed it a \"stroke of Gen Z marketing genius,\" playing into the kind of ironic, quasi-existential humor that has so defined the social media age. Given that this wasn't exactly Joe Biden's strong suit, Team Harris-Walz seems to know exactly what they're doing.\n\nAnd don't worry: Tim Walz has already modeled the new hat for us, proving again that he's truly a man of the people. As a proud Minnesotan and someone who voted for Walz back in 2018, I'm definitely partial here, but look how precious he is!\n\nFor now, there's been no word on whether the Harris-Walz campaign has plans to put more trucker hats into production, but given the response to the first launch, it seems inevitable that more units will go on sale soon. Only time will tell if they can keep up the momentum and mobilize brats and midwest princesses alike to the ballot boxes come November."],"source":{"uri":["themarysue.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["The Mary Sue"]},"authors":[{"uri":["amanda_landwehr@themarysue.com"],"name":["Amanda Landwehr"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://www.themarysue.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Tim-Walz-Kamala-Harris.jpg"],"eventUri":["eng-9798191"],"sentiment":[0.3412],"wgt":[460763900],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8264253653"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["21:58:15"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T21:58:15Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T21:56:38Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/harris-walz-camouflage-midwest-princess-214952256.html"],"title":["Harris-Walz camouflage 'midwest princess' hat reaches nearly $1m in sales a day after release"],"body":["The Kamala Harris-Tim Walz camouflage \"midwest princess\" hat, seemingly inspired by singer Chappell Roan, has reached nearly $1m in sales in 24 hours.\n\nOn August 6, Vice President Harris declared the Minnesota governor as her Democratic running mate for the 2024 presidential election this November.

In the video, the 60-year-old Minnesota Governor is seen sitting in his living room wearing a quintessentially Midwest outfit: a black t-shirt, khakis, white sneakers, and a camo hat. Walz's outfit quickly garnered attention -- especially from Chappell Roan fans who joked about the similarity between the singer's viral Midwest Princess hat and Walz's.\n\nSoon after, the Harris and Walz campaign released its camo hat which looks almost identical to the Midwest Princess lid. Even Roan herself commented on the now-viral hat, tweeting \"is this real\" in response to another tweet about the hat.\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign hasn't officially confirmed whether the hat is a reference to Roan, but they do already have a track record of embracing artists' iconography. A couple of weeks ago, after Charlie XCX tweeted \"kamala IS brat,\" the VP's official Twitter page changed its background image to a Brat-green one. Needless to say, fans of Harris and Charlie quickly spun up Brat-themed Harris merch that you can also find on sites like Etsy.\n\nIf you're hoping for a Harris-Walz win in November, pick up a Roan-inspired camo hat on Etsy here."],"source":{"uri":["rollingstone.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Rolling Stone"]},"authors":[{"uri":["oscar_hartzog@rollingstone.com"],"name":["Oscar Hartzog"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Gray_5.jpg?w=900&h=600&crop=1"],"eventUri":["eng-9798191"],"sentiment":[0.1843],"wgt":[460763742],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8264247795"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["21:54:06"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T21:54:06Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T21:49:10Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/JUSHI-HOLDINGS-INC-120797496/news/Jushi-Financial-Statements-Q2-2024-47588355/"],"title":["Jushi :  Financial Statements Q2 2024"],"body":["CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this \"report\") may contain \"forward-looking statements\" and \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including Canadian securities legislation and United States (\"U.S.\") securities legislation (collectively, \"forward-looking information\") which are based upon the Company's current internal expectations, estimates, projections, assumptions and beliefs.

Tim Walz, announced this week as U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate for the 2024 presidential election -- wasn't at Farmfest this year. But he had a former U.S. senator and his lieutenant governor stumping for him and defending his record in farm country.\n\nThe Harris campaign highlighted the agricultural record of Walz in the press release announcing his selection.\n\n\"He became a member of Congress in a Republican district by representing the needs of farmers and rural America,\" said the campaign.\n\nIn southwest Minnesota, which is far from blue territory in the state, Walz got support from former U.S. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat from North Dakota, who was at Farmfest on Aug. 7 on behalf of the Harris-Walz ticket.\n\nHeitkamp met Walz during her first couple weeks in Congress.\n\n\"I got to meet him traveling back and forth on the plane from D.C. to the Twin Cities, and I tell people my first impression was that I've known him all my life,\" Heitkamp said. \"He's like everybody else that I grew up with. Every social studies teacher, every person who makes communities work.\"\n\nWalz, a U.S. House member for 12 years before becoming Minnesota's governor, has a history of supporting farmers, Heitkamp said. She called him \"instrumental\" in passing \"one of the most successful farm bills.\"\n\nDuring his last term in Congress, Walz sponsored legislation to expand veterans' access to farm programs.\n\n\"We've been building on that ever since,\" Heitkamp said of the current farm bill which includes extended provisions from Walz's veterans bill.\n\nHeitkamp said she believes that Walz, who grew up on his family's farm in Nebraska, will give rural America \"a seat at the table\" if elected as vice president.\n\n\"Where we are headed in agriculture going into the future, we can't just rest on our laurels and assume that we can keep doing the same thing that we've always done.

Peggy Flanagan filled in for Walz during his slotted speech time at Farmfest, as he attended a campaign rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\n\"I think during our last five years, we've been incredible partners with agriculture,\" Flanagan said.\n\nShe pointed to hiring farmer and former Minnesota Farmers Union lobbyist Thom Petersen as Minnesota's ag commissioner as \"one of the most powerful things\" done by Walz's administration.\n\n\"The investments that we have made in ensuring that we have low-interest loans for farmers, our work around emerging farmers has been important, and the investments in AGRI (value-added grants) and dairy,\" she said of some of the accomplishments led by Walz.\n\nShe said the Walz administration has been able to respond and partner with farmers as the state has navigated through multiple droughts and now flooding.\n\n\"The best thing, I think, that we can point to is how we listen to the agriculture community, and then we see that translated into policy.

As the Democratic nominee for the 2024 presidential election, Harris's new stance reflects the growing role of digital assets in the political landscape.\n\nThis comes as former President Donald Trump continues to support the crypto sector.\n\nRussell Starr, head of capital markets at DeFi Technologies and an upcoming speaker at Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets event, provided valuable insights on Harris's new approach. Starr believes Harris's involvement with cryptocurrency highlights its rising importance and her effort to connect with this rapidly expanding industry.\n\nAlso Read: Kamala Harris's Election Odds Just Hit A Peak Of 48%, According To Crypto Bettors -- Is It The Walz Effect?\n\nClear Regulations and Industry Cooperation\n\nStarr pointed out that Harris's focus on clear regulations could benefit the crypto industry by providing straightforward guidelines. \"By providing this clarity, the U.S. can attract more investment and innovation in the crypto space, making it a global leader in digital assets,\" Starr noted.\n\nHarris's outreach to crypto leaders and stakeholders could also ensure that policies are informed by practical knowledge. Starr stated, \"This kind of engagement fosters collaboration and helps bridge the gap between policymakers and industry innovators, potentially leading to more effective and practical regulations.\"\n\nAdvancing Financial Inclusion\n\nIntegrating cryptocurrencies into the traditional financial system could also promote financial inclusion, helping those underserved by banks. Starr highlighted that this approach supports the development of new technologies, making financial services more accessible.\n\nHowever, Starr cautioned that for Harris's engagement to be effective, it's essential that policies involve input from diverse stakeholders within the crypto community. Balancing progress with regulation requires a comprehensive understanding of the industry's unique challenges and opportunities. He also stressed the importance of keeping the approach nonpartisan to avoid alienating groups.\n\nWant To Learn More\n\nAs Harris's stance on digital currencies develops, Starr believes her involvement shows a recognition of the sector's growing influence and the need for thoughtful policies.\n\nHe concluded, \"By fostering a supportive regulatory environment and encouraging open dialogue, Harris can help pave the way for a more inclusive, innovative, and sustainable future for cryptocurrencies.\"\n\nThe upcoming Benzinga Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19 in NYC will provide a platform for further discussion and networking among digital asset companies and institutional investors. This event will feature over 1,000 capital markets leaders and offer numerous opportunities for engagement and collaboration, reflecting the growing interest and adoption of digital assets.\n\nRead Next: Donald Trump Jr. And Eric Trump Tease DeFi Project With 'BeDeFiant' Hashtag\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\nMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs"],"source":{"uri":["benzinga.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Benzinga"]},"authors":[{"uri":["abbey_higginbotham@benzinga.com"],"name":["Abbey Higginbotham"],"type":["author"],"isAgency":[false]}],"image":["https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2024/08/07/kamala-harris.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&fit=crop"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.498],"wgt":[460762233],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["2024-08-447389206"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["21:29:50"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T21:29:50Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T21:04:05Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0.6039],"url":["https://www.newsmax.com/politics/nancy-pelosi-paul-pelosi-assault/2024/08/07/id/1175639/"],"title":["Pelosi Blames Republicans for Attack on Husband"],"body":["Former House Speaker Rep.

What he said was surprisingly biblical.\n\nWhen Minnesota Governor Tim Walz was announced as Kamala Harris's running mate in the 2024 presidential election, many of my Lutheran family, friends, and colleagues celebrated that he was Lutheran as well. Walz counts himself as a \"Minnesota Lutheran dad,\" and his church, Pilgrim Lutheran in St. Paul, is part of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the denomination in which I'm ordained.\n\nThe Lutherans in Minnesota are mostly descended from Scandinavian immigrants who settled the area in the 1800s, though Walz's parents are Roman Catholic. Walz hasn't talked at length (yet) about how his faith inform his stance on political issues. However, his support for affordable health care, education funding, social justice and equality, clean air and water, advocacy for the LGBTQIA+ community, and providing free lunch to all school children certainly reflect Jesus's teachings to care for one's neighbors, protect the vulnerable, and feed those in need.\n\nIn part of his speech, he said this:\n\nSome of us are old enough to remember when it was Republicans who were talking about freedom. It turns out now what they meant was that the government should be free to invade your doctor's office. In Minnesota we respect our neighbors and the personal choices that they make. Even if we wouldn't make the same choice for ourselves, there's a golden rule: Mind your own damn business!\n\nIn other words, Walz believes the government should not be dictating how one expresses their gender, who they love, what they read, what health care they can receive, or what religion they practice.\n\nThis contrasts with the christofascist architects of Project 2025 who want to implement their 900 pages worth of authoritarian thought-control and twisted, controlling morality on U.S. citizens through a second Trump administration.\n\nWhile \"Mind your own damn business\" elicited raucous applause from the crowd, it also struck me that this phrase is surprisingly biblical. Both the Hebrew Scriptures and the New Testament contain teachings and instructions about not meddling in people's personal affairs. These passages are applicable both to individuals and to lawmakers. Let's dig in.\n\nExodus 20:1-7 and Deut 5:4-21\n\nThis one may shock you. Aren't the Ten Commandments all about dictating behavior? Well, yes and no. What they do is help us determine what's acceptable and what's not when it comes to how our personal actions impact others.\n\nIf you love God, you won't worship human-made idols or use God's name for blasphemy - both of which center human power and use religion to justify this power. Also, if you love God, you'll allow yourself and others a day of rest. You'll honor your parents and others in society. If you love God, you won't murder, harm your life partner, steal, lie, or scheme to take what others have.\n\nIn other words, mind your own damn business. If your business harms others, then we need to intervene. If not, the government should not be legislating the behaviors of others because it's none of their damn business.\n\nProverbs 25:17\n\nLet your foot be seldom in your neighbor's house,\n\notherwise the neighbor will become weary of you and hate you.\n\nProverbs is a collection of pithy aphorisms and advice that are as much about one's faith as about how to live together in community. Proverbs 25:17 cautions against being overly intrusive in people's lives and respecting others' boundaries. This goes for individuals, but it also applies to the government which need not set foot in citizens' personal lives unless there is something criminal or harmful going on.\n\nProverbs 26:17\n\nLike one who grabs a stray dog by the ears is someone who rushes into a quarrel not their own.\n\nAgain, this works not just for individuals with a predilection of involving themselves in disputes that do not concern them, but for government interference in people's lives. There is no need for busybodies or for the state to meddle in other people's affairs.\n\nSo, stop grabbing the ears of the dog! Mind your own damn business!\n\nPaul wrote to the church in Thessalonica: \"Aspire to live quietly, to mind your own affairs, and to work with your hands, as we directed you, so that you may behave properly towards outsiders and be dependent on no one.\"\n\nDid you catch that? Paul literally told folks: mind your own damn business! When self-righteous Christians try to dictate what you can and cannot do, whip out this verse to remind them to focus on their own lives and work. They don't need to involve themselves in the affairs of others. Respect yourself and respect others. Seriously, it's not that hard.\n\n\"But let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, a criminal, or even as a mischief-maker.\"\n\nWow, Jesus's right-hand man, Peter, put \"mischief-makers\" (i.e., meddlers) on par with murderers, thieves, and criminals!\n\nWhy so harsh? Because being a thought-policing sanctimonious busy-body stirs up trouble for people who are just minding their own business. For example, if a person want to dress in drag, or marry someone you don't approve of, or read books to their kids that you don't like, what business is that of yours? Stop targeting them. Because that can, in fact, lead to a mob mentality and, ultimately, murder and crime against innocent people.\n\nWhy do you pass judgment on your sibling? Or you, why do you despise them? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God. For it is written,\n\n'As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me,\n\nand every tongue shall give praise to God.'\n\nSo then, each of us will be accountable to God.\n\nLet us therefore no longer pass judgment on one another, but resolve instead never to put a stumbling-block or hindrance in the way of another.\n\nThis is another passage that helps us distinguish what's acceptable to pass judgment on and what's not. Paul's letter to the Romans tells us that if someone's behavior is a \"stumbling block\" or \"hindrance\" that harms others, then we need to pay attention to that. If it's not, then leave them alone.\n\nAs Tim Walz said in his speech, respect your neighbors and the personal choices that they make. Just because you wouldn't make that choice for yourself does not mean you should pass judgment on them and hate on them and get everyone else in your circle to gang up on them.\n\nFor example, if a woman decides with her doctor to terminate her pregnancy, or if she decides to use IVF to become pregnant, that is her decision. Not yours, not the government's. Mind your own damn business!\n\nAnd finally a word about minding your own business from Jesus himself:\n\n\"Why do you see the speck in your neighbor's eye, but do not notice the log in your own eye? Or how can you say to your neighbor, \"Let me take the speck out of your eye\", while the log is in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your neighbor's eye.\"\n\nThis is Jesus literally saying to the crowds gathered on the mountain, mind your own damn business! Stop passing judgment on people. You don't know what they're going through. You don't know what challenges they are facing. It feels awful when people do that to you, so don't do it to others.\n\nWhen you point out the insignificant things about people to draw attention to them in a negative way and make them feel ashamed about who they are and what and who they love - while expecting people to ignore your obvious faults - you are a hypocrite. It's petty, it's juvenile, and it sullies your own integrity. So just stop.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have targeted people who are trans, gender-fluid, gay, lesbian, bisexual, and anything other than cisgender heteronormative for decades. It's especially heinous that they are picking on children by passing laws against gender-affirming care in some states and banning books with LGBTQIA stories and characters.\n\nKeep in mind that in Jesus's time, they did not have the modern parlance about gender that we do today. But he says something very interesting about eunuchs in the Gospel of Matthew:\n\n'Not everyone can accept this teaching, but only those to whom it is given. For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept this who can.' Matthew 19:11-12\n\nEunuchs were castrated men placed in charge over a king's harem of wives and concubines. But what Jesus is saying here is that some people are a certain gender because of their physical conditions or their inclinations from birth. Others are made eunuchs not by their own choice but by force. Still others choose to express their gender \"for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.\" In other words, it is to the glory of God that they are who they are.\n\nThus, gender and gender expression are personal matters that should in no way be legislated by the state or judged by others.\n\nJesus concludes by saying, \"The one who can accept this should accept it.\" What I hear him saying without words is: the rest of you can mind your own damn business!\n\nStated in a more positive way, Walz's words and these biblical passages are about living a life guided by practical, common-sense wisdom, respecting others, and allowing people to live without unnecessary conflict and interference.\n\nWhen we focus on our own responsibilities and practice humility and self-reflection, we encourage others to do the same. It's about personal integrity, freedom from harassment, and freedom to pursue joy.\n\nAnd all of this is, indeed, biblical.\n\n3 New Testament Messages for Resisting Autocracy\n\n3 Old Testament Passages about the Tyranny of Kings\n\nPreaching 2024 Election - How will Clergy Navigate Issues?"],"source":{"uri":["patheos.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Patheos - Seek.

Join us.\"\n\nThe Associated Press (AP) celebrated as well the fact that Kamala is the official Democratic presidential nominee despite never having been voted on by members of her party to hold the spot.\n\nOne of the big reasons why Kamala picked Walz is because he is \"a leading driver of Democrats' attacks on Trump,\" according to CNN. Democrats wanted an attack dog, in other words, which they got with Walz.\n\n(Related: Even the DNC's compliance manager believes that Kamala has no chance of winning - at least not without rigging the election.)\n\nWhile it was initially thought that Kamala would pick someone else like Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro or Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Walz took the spot after a viral cable news interview in which he called the nation's Republicans \"weird.\"\n\n\"Walz was also seen by many as a safer choice for Harris thanks to his liberal bona fides and the fact that some of the other contenders had come under fire from certain segments of the left,\" reported The Hill.\n\nKeep in mind that the same media celebrating Kamala's pick of Walz, who is 60 years old (but looks about 75), had previously criticized Republicans for nominating Trump, who is 78.\n\nWalz, by the way, failed to send in the National Guard in a timely fashion after the George Floyd incident, which is why parts of Minneapolis ended up burned to the ground in the 2020 summer of rage. Other actions by Walz that voters probably want to know include:\n\n- Fueling the George Floyd riots with his actions and rhetoric\n\n- Calling Trump supporters \"fascists\" after the recent assassination attempt\n\n- Championing extreme LGBT trans surgeries and abortion laws\n\nWalz also used to work for Israel Defense Forces (IDF); is a proud member of Antifa; and signed into law legislation allowing illegal aliens in Minnesota to obtain drivers' licenses.\n\nAs for the many Americans who are calling out Joe Biden for being too old and demented to occupy the Oval Office, Walz says these people are guilty of \"ageism\" because Biden is just fine, in his opinion.\n\n\"Two sickening commies to run against two sickening Zionists,\" one commenter wrote about the race between Kamala-Walz and Trump-Vance. \"Love it. What a cool country.\"\n\nAnother warned that World War III is sure to materialize if Walz ends up as vice president. During the Barack Obama years, Walz, a retired Army officer, told AIPAC that the U.S. supports Israel's settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem because Israel \"is our truest and closest ally in the region with a commitment to values of personal freedoms and liberties, surrounded by a pretty tough neighborhood.\"\n\n\"His daughter was an active loot and burner, too,\" noted another commenter about Walz's offspring.\n\nThe latest news about the 2024 presidential election can be found at Rigged.news."],"source":{"uri":["naturalnews.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["NaturalNews.com"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2024/08/Tim-Walz-Press-Conference.jpg"],"eventUri":["eng-9795783"],"sentiment":[0.1137],"wgt":[460760767],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["2024-08-447364461"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["20:53:13"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T20:53:13Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T20:44:22Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://gazette.com/news/wex/harris-resets-electoral-map-moving-three-states-in-democrats-favor/article_aacb4644-1782-52c8-9ba8-cf9661823c35.html"],"title":["Harris 'resets' electoral map, moving three states in Democrats' favor"],"body":["A nonpartisan election handicapper has updated ratings for three states in the 2024 presidential election cycle, shifting them toward Democrats after Vice President Kamala Harris became the party's nominee for president.\n\nSabato's Crystal Ball is now moving Georgia into the \"toss-up\" category, and Minnesota and New Hampshire are now rated as \"likely Democratic.\" Georgia had previously been identified as leaning Republican, and Minnesota and New Hampshire had been identified as likely Democratic.\n\nGeorgia has 11 electoral votes, Minnesota has 10, and New Hampshire has four.

Walz, the Democrat Party's nominee for vice president, purportedly never saw combat and left the service before his unit was sent to Iraq in 2005.\n\n\"We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war,\" Walz said in the past.\n\nHowever, a number of veterans who were personally familiar with Walz have now openly asserted that Harris's vice presidential pick never even deployed.\n\nRetired Command Sergeants Major Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr claimed in a letter published on Facebook in 2018 that during Walz's initial gubernatorial campaign, he left the National Guard after discovering his battalion would be sent to Iraq, even though he had promised his fellow soldiers that he would be joining them.\n\n\"On May 16, 2005, [Walz] quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war,\" wrote Behrends and Herr.\n\n60-year-old Walz left the military in time to begin his political career the next year, winning a congressional bid in 2006.\n\nAdditionally, Walz's radical far-left policies as governor has seemingly been ignored by left-wing mainstream media outlets, which praised him as a \"down-to-earth White guy\" who could win over rural America in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nMeanwhile, Walz has also made a number of offensive jokes about a true decorated war hero, JD Vance (R-Ohio), while viciously ridiculing him.\n\n\"I came from a family where nobody in my family had ever gone to law school, I grew up in a poor family,\" Vance said. \"The fact that Tim Walz wants to turn it into a bad thing is that I worked myself through college, through law school, and made something of myself. To me, that's the American dream, and if Tim Walz wants to insult it, frankly that's pretty bizarre.\"\n\nDonald Trump's running mate, Vance, was in the U.S. Marines and he was deployed to Iraq for six months in late 2005. The Ohio senator \"enlisted in the military directly out of high school\" and \"joined the Marines in 2003,\" serving as a \"combat correspondent,\" USA Today reported.\n\nA reporter had previously approached Vance in regards to Walz ridiculing him on his past service.\n\nAfter highlighting the extraordinary effort it required to fulfill his educational goals and after paying tribute to his modest beginnings, Vance unleashed a torrent of criticism on Walz for his heinous betrayal of his National Guard brethren.\n\n\"Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?\" Vance asked. \"What was this weapon you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went into Iraq? And he has not spent a day in a combat zone.\"\n\n\"Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, he dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him. I think that's shameful,\" Vance continued.\n\nStay informed! Receive breaking news blasts directly to your inbox for free.

(NASDAQ: BYND) (\"Beyond Meat\" or \"the Company\"), a leader in plant-based meat, today reported financial results for its second quarter ended June 29, 2024.\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights\n\nBeyond Meat President and CEO Ethan Brown commented, \"We are pleased to report a strong quarter of progress against our 2024 plan, a pivotal year on our path to sustainable operations and profitability. Key proof points include exceeding our Q2 revenue guidance; continued reduction in operating expenses and cash consumption; and our best quarterly gross margin since Q3 2021.\n\n\"Further, we firmly reiterated our center-of-the-plate position in the global health and wellness trend with the launch of our Beyond IV platform. Developed in collaboration with leading medical and nutrition experts, and recognized by the nation's leading health organizations, including the American Diabetes Association's evidence-based nutritional guidelines for its Better Choices for Life program and included in a collection of heart-healthy recipes certified by the American Heart Association's Heart-Check program, we are thrilled to see consumer, media, and nutritionist enthusiasm for this latest, important, renovation.\"\n\nBrown continued, \"Finally, alongside the strengthening of our operations and product portfolio, we are working on bolstering our balance sheet.\"\n\nSecond Quarter 2024\n\nNet revenues decreased 8.8% to $93.2 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $102.1 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in net revenues was primarily driven by a 14.0% decrease in volume of products sold, partially offset by a 6.1% increase in net revenue per pound. The increase in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by lower trade discounts, price increases of certain of our products in our U.S. retail and foodservice channels and, to a lesser extent, changes in product sales mix, partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nU.S. retail channel net revenues decreased 7.5% to $44.9 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $48.5 million in the year-ago period, primarily due to a 23.2% decrease in volume of products sold, primarily reflecting weak category demand and the lapping of substantial promotional sales to a club channel customer in the year-ago period, partially offset by a 20.5% increase in net revenue per pound, primarily driven by lower trade discounts, changes in product sales mix and price increases of certain of our products. U.S. retail channel net revenues included $0.8 million from ingredient sales in the quarter.\n\nU.S. foodservice channel net revenues decreased 18.9% to $10.4 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $12.8 million in the year-ago period, primarily due to a 20.0% decrease in volume of products sold, primarily reflecting weak category demand and, to a lesser extent, distribution losses, partially offset by a 1.4% increase in net revenue per pound, primarily driven by price increases of certain of our products and changes in product sales mix, partially offset by higher trade discounts.\n\nInternational retail channel net revenues decreased 12.1% to $17.6 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $20.0 million in the year-ago period, primarily due to a 6.9% decrease in net revenue per pound and a 5.5% decrease in volume of products sold, mainly reflecting reduced sales of chicken products in the EU and, to a lesser extent, demand softness in certain geographic regions. The decrease in net revenue per pound was primarily due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, increased trade discounts and pricing changes, partially offset by changes in product sales mix.\n\nInternational foodservice channel net revenues decreased 2.5% to $20.4 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $20.9 million in the year-ago period, primarily due to a 1.4% decrease in volume of products sold, and a 0.9% decrease in net revenue per pound, primarily resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in product sales mix, partially offset by lower trade discounts and pricing changes.\n\nNet revenues by channel (unaudited):\n\nThe following table presents the Company's net revenues by channel for the periods presented:\n\nThe following table presents consolidated volume of the Company's products sold in pounds for the periods presented:\n\nGross profit in the second quarter of 2024 was $13.7 million, or gross margin of 14.7%, compared to gross profit of $2.3 million, or gross margin of 2.2%, in the year-ago period. Gross profit and gross margin in the second quarter of 2024 were positively impacted by decreased cost of goods sold and increased net revenue per pound, partially offset by decreased volume of products sold. The decrease in cost of goods sold per pound primarily reflected lower inventory provision, lower manufacturing costs, including depreciation, and lower logistics costs, partially offset by higher materials costs.\n\nOperating expenses were $47.6 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $56.0 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to reduced marketing expenses and reduced non-production salaries and related costs, partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2024 included a $0.3 million increase in loss on sale of fixed assets compared to the year-ago period.\n\nLoss from operations was $33.9 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $53.8 million in the year-ago period. The decrease in loss from operations was driven by increased gross profit and reduced operating expenses.\n\nNet loss was $34.5 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $53.5 million in the year-ago period. Net loss per common share was $0.53 in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $0.83 in the year-ago period. The decrease in net loss was primarily driven by the reduction in loss from operations and a reduction in losses related to the Company's joint venture with PepsiCo, Inc., The Planet Partnership, LLC (\"TPP\"), partially offset by a reduction in Other income, net.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was a loss of $23.0 million, or -24.7% of net revenues, in the second quarter of 2024, compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $40.8 million, or -40.0% of net revenues, in the year-ago period.\n\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights\n\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents balance, including restricted cash, was $158.0 million and total outstanding debt was $1.1 billion as of June 29, 2024.

Net cash provided by investing activities in the six months ended June 29, 2024 included $3.2 million in proceeds from sales of fixed assets.\n\n2024 Outlook\n\nBased on management's best assessment of the environment today, the Company is updating its outlook for the full year 2024:\n\nTotal distribution outlets by channel (unaudited):\n\nThe following table presents the approximate number of distribution outlets by channel for the periods presented:\n\n__________\n\n(1) Excludes U.S. retail outlets unique to Beyond Meat Jerky, which has been discontinued.\n\n(2) The number of retail and foodservice outlets where Beyond Meat branded products are available was derived from rolling 52-week data as of June 2024.\n\nConference Call and Webcast\n\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss these results at 5:00 p.m. Eastern, 2:00 p.m. Pacific.

Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful additional information to investors about current trends in the Company's operations and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of operations. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assess operating performance and for business planning purposes. Management also believes these measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts, rating agencies and other parties in evaluating companies in our industry as a measure of our operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\n\"Adjusted loss from operations\" is defined as loss from operations adjusted to exclude, when applicable, costs attributable to special items, which are those items deemed not to be reflective of the Company's ongoing normal business activities.\n\n\"Adjusted operating margin\" is defined as Adjusted loss from operations divided by net revenues.\n\n\"Adjusted net loss\" is defined as net loss adjusted to exclude, when applicable, costs attributable to special items, which are those items deemed not to be reflective of the Company's normal business activities.\n\n\"Adjusted net loss per diluted common share\" is defined as Adjusted net loss divided by the number of diluted common shares outstanding.\n\nWe consider Adjusted loss from operations, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted net loss and Adjusted net loss per diluted common share to be useful indicators of operating performance because excluding special items allows for period-over-period comparisons of our ongoing operations. Adjusted net loss per diluted common share is a performance measure and should not be used as a measure of liquidity.\n\n\"Adjusted EBITDA\" is defined as net loss adjusted to exclude, when applicable, income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, restructuring (income) expenses, share-based compensation expense, accrued litigation settlement costs and Other, net, including interest income, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses.\n\n\"Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net revenues\" is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenues.\n\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted loss from operations, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted net loss, Adjusted net loss per diluted common share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net revenues rather than their most directly comparable GAAP measures.

(\"Jushi\" or the \"Company\") (CSE: JUSH) (OTCQX: JUSHF), a vertically integrated, multi-state cannabis operator, is pleased to announce its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024 (\"Q2 2024\"). All financial information is unaudited and provided in U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated and is prepared under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\").\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights\n\nSee \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\" and \"Unaudited Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin\" below.\n\nManagement Commentary\n\n\"Our second quarter performance underscores our efforts to strengthen our asset base while maintaining prudent cost-saving measures, and we believe this will help position us on a steady path to sustained profitability,\" said Jim Cacioppo, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman, and Founder of Jushi. \"Our organization-wide operational improvement plan is yielding promising results, with gross margin reaching 50.4% and Adjusted EBITDA further improving to 22.4% of revenue for the quarter. These successes were driven by efficiencies achieved mainly at our Virginia grower-processor facility and our ability to maintain a consistent output of our high-margin, top-selling product offerings. Additionally, Todd West, our newly appointed COO, has already played a crucial role in guiding additional enhancements across our business and we anticipate further progress throughout the remainder of the year under his direction.\"\n\nMr. Cacioppo continued, \"Our commercialization strategy remains a pivotal driver of our performance improvements, particularly in markets such as Ohio and Virginia. This includes the diversification of our brands and product offering with new, exclusive cultivars, and consistent enhancements to quality, potency, and yields. Throughout the second quarter, we launched an additional 308 new, high-margin SKUs across our footprint, bringing our year-to-date total to an impressive 751 new SKUs. We were thrilled to bring our full offerings of The Lab and Tasteology brands to Nevada to bolster our presence in this market, as well as launch our highly anticipated The Lab 2g vape cartridges in Pennsylvania. Our wholesale business also continues to perform well, particularly in Ohio which saw a 110% sequential and 76% year-over-year sales increase, signaling an encouraging trajectory following yesterday's launch of non-medical sales in the commonwealth. We will continue to scale our operations in Ohio, with plans to expand our capacity by approximately 15,000 square feet of double stacked cultivation, upgrades to our newly enhanced processing operations, as well as the anticipated opening of a non-medical dispensary in Springdale during the first quarter of 2025.\"\n\nMr. Cacioppo concluded, \"Subsequent to the quarter end, we took crucial steps to enhance our capital structure by reducing our debt to increase our financial flexibility, aligning us positively for the second half of the year. We've successfully refinanced our Acquisition Facility debt with a new term loan in the amount of $48.5 million and payments in July of $6.8 million from cash on hand. In addition, we repaid $3.6 million of promissory notes. With this strategic move, we are in a stronger position to further pursue expansion opportunities in Ohio following the launch of non-medical sales, as well as developing markets such as Pennsylvania and Virginia. As we believe a number of potential exciting regulatory developments may occur in the near-term, we remain vigilant for the anticipated rapid growth in several of our key markets, including Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.\"\n\nFinancial Results for the Second Quarter Ended June 30, 2024\n\n($ in millions)\n\nRevenue in Q2 2024 decreased 2.8% to $64.6 million as compared to $66.4 million in Q2 2023. The year-over-year decrease in revenue can be attributed to:\n\nThese declines were partially offset by an increase in sales in Virginia of 18% primarily due to the opening of one new store in August 2023. The Company ended the quarter with thirty-five operating dispensaries in seven states, as compared to thirty-four in seven states at the end of Q2 2023.\n\nWholesale revenue increased 11.6% year-over-year to $7.6 million in Q2 2024 as compared to $6.8 million in Q2 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to wholesale revenue growth in Virginia of 72% as the cultivation and processing facility in Virginia matured and had more product available for sale to third-parties. The growth in Virginia was partially offset by a 37% decline in wholesale revenue in Massachusetts due to continued competition.\n\nGross profit in Q2 2024 was $32.6 million, or 50.4% of revenue, compared to $30.6 million, or 46.0% of revenue in Q2 2023. The increase in gross profit and gross profit margin was driven by efficiencies at our cultivation and processing facilities which have enabled us to be more competitive on cost. During Q2 2024, we generated positive gross profit and gross profit margin from our wholesale revenue whereas in Q2 2023, we generated a loss. In our retail channel, gross profit declined due to lower sales; however, gross profit margin improved 110 basis points as a result of increased sell-through of Jushi branded products at our retail stores. Jushi branded product sales as a percentage of total retail revenue were 56% in Q2 2024 across the Company's five vertical markets compared to 47% in the prior year.\n\nOperating expenses for Q2 2024 were $24.2 million, compared to $27.2 million in Q2 2023, a reduction of $3.0 million or 11.0% year-over-year. The decrease was due primarily to (i) lower share-based compensation expense which reflects lower value of share-based compensation granted as well as forfeitures; and (ii) gains on the sale of certain non-core assets and operating lease terminations. These declines were partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense due to the expansion of our retail operations which resulted in certain fixed assets placed into service, as well amortization of our business licenses which commenced during the current quarter as we concluded, based on our assessment, that the Company's business licenses no longer have indefinite useful lives.\n\nNet loss for Q2 2024 was $1.9 million, primarily due to other expense, net of $1.0 million and income tax expense of $9.3 million, which was partially offset by income from operations of $8.4 million. Other expense, net, included interest expense of $9.1 million, which was partially offset by fair value gain on derivatives of $5.3 million and other income, net of $2.7 million.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in Q2 2024 was $14.5 million compared to $12.6 million in Q2 2023, representing an improvement of $1.9 million year-over-year.\n\nSee \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\" and \"Unaudited Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin\" below.\n\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $35.0 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company paid approximately $1.8 million in capital expenditures. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $11.1 million and $200.4 million in gross principal amount of short-term and long-term total debt, respectively, excluding leases and property, plant, and equipment financing obligations. Subsequent to the quarter end, the company reduced its total gross debt by approximately $10.5 million which includes $2.4 million for the July 1st regularly scheduled payment on the Acquisition Facility, $4.3 million payment in connection with the refinancing of the Acquisition Facility, as well as early extinguishment of $3.8 million in promissory notes. As a result, our short-term debt reduced to less than $1.0 million. Excluding the $21.5 million notes payable to Sammartino, as we currently have no obligation to repay these notes, the total debt balance subject to scheduled repayments after the post-quarter end payments was $180 million.\n\nAs of August 2, 2024, the Company's issued and outstanding shares were 196,643,264 and its fully diluted shares outstanding were 330,964,842.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\n\nThe Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial information provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations. For further information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please refer to the \"Unaudited Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin\" section of this press release.\n\nConference Call and Webcast Information\n\nThe Company will host a conference call and audio webcast for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024 at 4:30 p.m. ET today, Wednesday, August 7, 2024.\n\nFor interested individuals unable to join the conference call, a webcast of the call will be available for one month following the conference call and can be accessed via webcast on Jushi's Investor Relations website.\n\nAbout Jushi Holdings Inc.\n\nWe are a vertically integrated cannabis company led by an industry-leading management team.

We use non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes and to evaluate our financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin (each as defined below). We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect our ongoing business by excluding the effects of expenses that are not reflective of our operating business performance and allow for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in our business. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies. As there are no standardized methods of calculating these non-GAAP measures, our methods may differ from those used by others, and accordingly, the use of these measures may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by others, thus limiting their usefulness. Accordingly, these non-GAAP measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are financial measures that are not defined under GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income (loss), or \"earnings\", before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before: (i) non-cash share-based compensation expense; (ii) inventory-related adjustments; (iii) fair value changes in derivatives; (iv) other (income)/expense items; (v) transaction costs; (vi) asset impairment; (vii) gain/loss on debt extinguishment; and (viii) start-up costs. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue. These financial measures are metrics that have been adjusted from the GAAP net income (loss) measure in an effort to provide readers with a normalized metric in making comparisons more meaningful across the cannabis industry, as well as to remove non-recurring, irregular and one-time items that may otherwise distort the GAAP net income measure. Other companies in our industry may calculate this measure differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures."],"source":{"uri":["greenstocknews.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["Green Stock News"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://greenstocknews.com/images/ogimage.jpg"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.4902],"wgt":[460758151],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8264156737"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[true],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["20:19:26"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T20:19:26Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T20:18:17Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.socialnews.xyz/?p=6054001"],"title":["Where Trump, Harris stand on abortion rights (Video)"],"body":["Ahead of the 2024 presidential election, CBS News' Lana Zak breaks down how Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are defining their stances on abortion rights as reproductive care and women's health continue to resonate as top issues in this election.\n\nCBS News 24/7 is the premier anchored streaming news service from CBS News and Stations that is available free to everyone with access to the internet and is the destination for breaking news, live events, original reporting and storytelling, and programs from CBS News and Stations' top anchors and correspondents working locally, nationally and around the globe.

Vance, was shelved at a time when former President Donald Trump and his campaign have been trying to distance themselves from the project, which pushes a radical overhaul of the federal government that would give the president power to fire career civil servants and replace them with political loyalists.\n\nHowever, progressive media watchdog Media Matters for America has obtained a copy of the book and has found that it contains tirades against contraception, childless Americans, and even dog parks.\n\nWhen it comes to contraception, Roberts makes the case that it is at the root of much of what ails modern society.\n\nALSO READ: 21 worthless knick-knacks Donald Trump will give you for your cash\n\n\"We need to understand what could be called contraceptive technologies -- revolutionary inventions that shape American culture away from abundance, marriage, and family -- in the same vein,\" writes Roberts. \"They shift norms, incentives, and choices, often invisibly and involuntarily.

(\"Jushi\" or the \"Company\") (CSE: JUSH) (OTCQX: JUSHF), a vertically integrated, multi-state cannabis operator, is pleased to announce its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024 (\"Q2 2024\"). All financial information is unaudited and provided in U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated and is prepared under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\").\n\nSee \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\" and \"Unaudited Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin\" below.\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Company Highlights\n\nPost Quarter-End Developments\n\nManagement Commentary\n\n\"Our second quarter performance underscores our efforts to strengthen our asset base while maintaining prudent cost-saving measures, and we believe this will help position us on a steady path to sustained profitability,\" said Jim Cacioppo, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman, and Founder of Jushi. \"Our organization-wide operational improvement plan is yielding promising results, with gross margin reaching 50.4% and Adjusted EBITDA further improving to 22.4% of revenue for the quarter. These successes were driven by efficiencies achieved mainly at our Virginia grower-processor facility and our ability to maintain a consistent output of our high-margin, top-selling product offerings. Additionally, Todd West, our newly appointed COO, has already played a crucial role in guiding additional enhancements across our business and we anticipate further progress throughout the remainder of the year under his direction.\"\n\nMr. Cacioppo continued, \"Our commercialization strategy remains a pivotal driver of our performance improvements, particularly in markets such as Ohio and Virginia. This includes the diversification of our brands and product offering with new, exclusive cultivars, and consistent enhancements to quality, potency, and yields. Throughout the second quarter, we launched an additional 308 new, high-margin SKUs across our footprint, bringing our year-to-date total to an impressive 751 new SKUs. We were thrilled to bring our full offerings of The Lab and Tasteology brands to Nevada to bolster our presence in this market, as well as launch our highly anticipated The Lab 2g vape cartridges in Pennsylvania. Our wholesale business also continues to perform well, particularly in Ohio which saw a 110% sequential and 76% year-over-year sales increase, signaling an encouraging trajectory following yesterday's launch of non-medical sales in the commonwealth. We will continue to scale our operations in Ohio, with plans to expand our capacity by approximately 15,000 square feet of double stacked cultivation, upgrades to our newly enhanced processing operations, as well as the anticipated opening of a non-medical dispensary in Springdale during the first quarter of 2025.\"\n\nMr. Cacioppo concluded, \"Subsequent to the quarter end, we took crucial steps to enhance our capital structure by reducing our debt to increase our financial flexibility, aligning us positively for the second half of the year. We've successfully refinanced our Acquisition Facility debt with a new term loan in the amount of $48.5 million and payments in July of $6.8 million from cash on hand. In addition, we repaid $3.6 million of promissory notes. With this strategic move, we are in a stronger position to further pursue expansion opportunities in Ohio following the launch of non-medical sales, as well as developing markets such as Pennsylvania and Virginia. As we believe a number of potential exciting regulatory developments may occur in the near-term, we remain vigilant for the anticipated rapid growth in several of our key markets, including Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.\"\n\nFinancial Results for the Second Quarter Ended June 30, 2024\n\n($ in millions)\n\nRevenue in Q2 2024 decreased 2.8% to $64.6 million as compared to $66.4 million in Q2 2023. The year-over-year decrease in revenue can be attributed to:\n\nThese declines were partially offset by an increase in sales in Virginia of 18% primarily due to the opening of one new store in August 2023. The Company ended the quarter with thirty-five operating dispensaries in seven states, as compared to thirty-four in seven states at the end of Q2 2023.\n\nWholesale revenue increased 11.6% year-over-year to $7.6 million in Q2 2024 as compared to $6.8 million in Q2 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to wholesale revenue growth in Virginia of 72% as the cultivation and processing facility in Virginia matured and had more product available for sale to third-parties. The growth in Virginia was partially offset by a 37% decline in wholesale revenue in Massachusetts due to continued competition.\n\nGross profit in Q2 2024 was $32.6 million, or 50.4% of revenue, compared to $30.6 million, or 46.0% of revenue in Q2 2023. The increase in gross profit and gross profit margin was driven by efficiencies at our cultivation and processing facilities which have enabled us to be more competitive on cost. During Q2 2024, we generated positive gross profit and gross profit margin from our wholesale revenue whereas in Q2 2023, we generated a loss. In our retail channel, gross profit declined due to lower sales; however, gross profit margin improved 110 basis points as a result of increased sell-through of Jushi branded products at our retail stores. Jushi branded product sales as a percentage of total retail revenue were 56% in Q2 2024 across the Company's five vertical markets compared to 47% in the prior year.\n\nOperating expenses for Q2 2024 were $24.2 million, compared to $27.2 million in Q2 2023, a reduction of $3.0 million or 11.0% year-over-year. The decrease was due primarily to (i) lower share-based compensation expense which reflects lower value of share-based compensation granted as well as forfeitures; and (ii) gains on the sale of certain non-core assets and operating lease terminations. These declines were partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense due to the expansion of our retail operations which resulted in certain fixed assets placed into service, as well amortization of our business licenses which commenced during the current quarter as we concluded, based on our assessment, that the Company's business licenses no longer have indefinite useful lives.\n\nNet loss for Q2 2024 was $1.9 million, primarily due to other expense, net of $1.0 million and income tax expense of $9.3 million, which was partially offset by income from operations of $8.4 million. Other expense, net, included interest expense of $9.1 million, which was partially offset by fair value gain on derivatives of $5.3 million and other income, net of $2.7 million.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in Q2 2024 was $14.5 million compared to $12.6 million in Q2 2023, representing an improvement of $1.9 million year-over-year.\n\nSee \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\" and \"Unaudited Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin\" below.\n\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $35.0 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company paid approximately $1.8 million in capital expenditures. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $11.1 million and $200.4 million in gross principal amount of short-term and long-term total debt, respectively, excluding leases and property, plant, and equipment financing obligations. Subsequent to the quarter end, the company reduced its total gross debt by approximately $10.5 million which includes $2.4 million for the July 1st regularly scheduled payment on the Acquisition Facility, $4.3 million payment in connection with the refinancing of the Acquisition Facility, as well as early extinguishment of $3.8 million in promissory notes. As a result, our short-term debt reduced to less than $1.0 million. Excluding the $21.5 million notes payable to Sammartino, as we currently have no obligation to repay these notes, the total debt balance subject to scheduled repayments after the post-quarter end payments was $180 million.\n\nAs of August 2, 2024, the Company's issued and outstanding shares were 196,643,264 and its fully diluted shares outstanding were 330,964,842.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\n\nThe Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial information provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations.

We use non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes and to evaluate our financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin (each as defined below). We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect our ongoing business by excluding the effects of expenses that are not reflective of our operating business performance and allow for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in our business. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies. As there are no standardized methods of calculating these non-GAAP measures, our methods may differ from those used by others, and accordingly, the use of these measures may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by others, thus limiting their usefulness. Accordingly, these non-GAAP measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are financial measures that are not defined under GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income (loss), or \"earnings\", before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before: (i) non-cash share-based compensation expense; (ii) inventory-related adjustments; (iii) fair value changes in derivatives; (iv) other (income)/expense items; (v) transaction costs; (vi) asset impairment; (vii) gain/loss on debt extinguishment; and (viii) start-up costs. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue. These financial measures are metrics that have been adjusted from the GAAP net income (loss) measure in an effort to provide readers with a normalized metric in making comparisons more meaningful across the cannabis industry, as well as to remove non-recurring, irregular and one-time items that may otherwise distort the GAAP net income measure. Other companies in our industry may calculate this measure differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures."],"source":{"uri":["wallstreet-online.de"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["wallstreet:online"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/6/source1280/size_645/globenewswire-1280.png"],"eventUri":["eng-9792181"],"sentiment":[0.3804],"wgt":[460757646],"relevance":[1]},{"uri":["8264148724"],"lang":["eng"],"isDuplicate":[false],"date":["2024-08-07"],"time":["20:11:44"],"dateTime":["2024-08-07T20:11:44Z"],"dateTimePub":["2024-08-07T20:11:11Z"],"dataType":["news"],"sim":[0],"url":["https://www.cbsnews.com/video/where-trump-harris-stand-on-abortion-rights-2024-election/"],"title":["Where Trump, Harris stand on abortion rights"],"body":["Ahead of the 2024 presidential election, CBS News' Lana Zak breaks down how Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are defining their stances on abortion rights as reproductive care and women's health continue to resonate as top issues in this election."],"source":{"uri":["cbsnews.com"],"dataType":["news"],"title":["CBS News"]},"authors":[],"image":["https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/08/07/a4a84e26-952f-4fb1-8e70-67641e659620/thumbnail/1200x630/d62ace55dafca602734d7828354d33bb/cbsn-fusion-where-trump-harris-stand-on-abortion-rights-2024-election-thumbnail.jpg?v=0a0c17d349635d55704afd4e16e28fc6"],"eventUri":{},"sentiment":[0.6157],"wgt":[460757504],"relevance":[1]}],"totalResults":[9521],"page":[1],"count":[100],"pages":[96]}
