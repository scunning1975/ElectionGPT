His second term could see a shift towards authoritarianism, with plans including draconian immigration policies, massive deportations, reinstating the Muslim travel ban, and reshaping energy policy to favour fossil fuels. His approach to regain power is largely motivated by his desire to avoid prison and avoid legal issues. He has been convicted on 34 felony counts related to a hush-money cover-up and facing federal charges related to election interference and a Georgia indictment, and views regaining the White House as a way to abuse power and interfere with his criminal cases. His plans for a second term also include a radical approach to immigration, promising mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. His administration is expected to use broad executive powers to implement these policies, potentially leading to significant constitutional and humanitarian issues.
