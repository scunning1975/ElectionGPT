    "content": "Plan B One-Step, an emergency contraceptive commonly referred to as the \"morning after pill.\"Darin Oswald / Idaho Statesman / Tribune News Service via Getty Images fileThe Biden administration is proposing a rule that would provide women with private insurance access to over-the-counter birth control pills and other contraceptives at no cost, the White House said on Monday.The rule, which expands a federal mandate requiring health insurers to cover preventative care services at no cost to patients under the Affordable Care Act, is being proposed by the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and the Treasury. It would come into effect in 2025 if finalized.\"This rule, once finalized, will expand contraception coverage for 52 million women of reproductive age with private health insurance,\" White House Gender Policy Council Director Jennifer Klein said during a briefing.\"For the first time ever, women would be able to obtain over-the-counter contraception without a prescription at no additional cost, and health plans would have to cover even more prescribed contraceptives without cost sharing,\" she said.Perrigo Co.'s Opill is currently the only daily birth control pill approved for sale without a prescription by the Food and Drug Administration, but the proposed rule covers other forms of over-the-counter contraceptives, including emergency contraception such as morning after pill Plan B, spermicides, birth control sponges, and condoms.The rule will also require that health plans cover all FDA-approved contraceptive drugs and some devices, including IUDs, without cost sharing in many cases.The proposal comes just two weeks before the 2024 presidential election, in which abortion rights has been a key issue following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v Wade in 2022. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, has made access to abortion central to her campaign.Republican rival former President Donald Trump has bragged about appointing three of the conservative justices who made the ruling but has since said abortion laws should be determined by U.S. states, stopping short of proposing a national ban that could imperil his chances with swing voters in the November election.",

    "title": "Free condoms? Biden administration says health insurance should cover over-the-counter birth control",
    "content": "WASHINGTON - Those with private health insurance would be able to get free over-the-counter methods of birth control, including condoms, the \"morning after\" pill, and daily oral contraceptives under a newly-proposed rule announced by the White House.Currently, private health insurance must cover the cost of prescribed contraception, including prescription birth control or condoms that doctors have issued a prescription for. The new rule, announced on Monday, would expand coverage and allow millions of people to get free condoms, birth control pills, or \"morning after\" pills from local stores without a prescription.The proposal comes almost two weeks before Election Day, with Vice President Kamala Harris promising to expand women's health care access as part of her presidential campaign following the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade - the constitutional right to abortion.Former President Donald Trump appointed some of the justices who issued the ruling, and Harris has sought to paint a distinct contrast from her Republican challenger in the race.\"President Biden and I stand with the majority of Americans - Republicans and Democrats alike - who support access to contraception,\" Harris said in a statement about the rule. \"And we continue to call on Congress to pass federal legislation that restores reproductive freedom nationwide.\"Trump, for his part, said he \"has never and will never\" advocate for restricting birth control and other contraceptives after seeming to suggest the idea in an interview earlier this year.Emergency contraceptives that people on private insurance would be able to access without costs include levonorgestrel, a pill more commonly known by the brand name \"Plan B\" that needs to be taken immediately after sex to prevent pregnancy.Without a doctor's prescription, women may pay as much as $50 for a pack of the pills. Additionally, women who delay buying the medication in order to get a doctor's prescription could jeopardize the pill's effectiveness, since it is most likely to prevent a pregnancy within 72 hours after sex.If implemented, the new rule would also require insurers to fully cover the once-a-day Opill, a new over-the-counter birth control pill that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved last year. A one-month supply of the pills costs $20.Federal mandates for private health insurance to cover contraceptive care were first introduced with the Affordable Care Act, which required plans to pick up the cost of FDA-approved birth control that had been prescribed by a doctor as a preventative service.In a statement, the White House called the proposed rule \"the most significant expansion of contraception coverage under the Affordable Care Act since 2012\" if it is finalized.The proposed rule would not impact those on Medicaid, the insurance program for the poorest Americans. States are largely left to design their own rules around Medicaid coverage for contraception, and few cover over-the-counter methods like Plan B or condoms.The proposed rule will undergo a comment period, and if approved, it likely wouldn't go into effect until 2025 and could change depending on the outcome of the 2024 presidential election.",

It's in the discomfort she observed during a question-and-answer at a recent Democratic Party campaign event in Pittsburgh. It's in her own family.\"The family that is my generation and older generations, I don't think anybody is voting for Harris, and we've never voted Republican, ever,\" Kaufman, 49, said, referring to Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. \"My sister has a Trump sign outside her house, and that is a huge shift.\"How big a shift? Surveys continue to find that most Jewish voters still support the Democratic ticket, and Kaufman acknowledges that she's an exception.Still, any shift could have enormous implications in Pennsylvania, where tens of thousands of votes decided the past two presidential elections. Many Jewish voters say the 2024 presidential election is like no other in memory, coming amid the growing fallout from Hamas' brutal attack on Israelis last year.▶ Read more about Jewish voters in this election.",

    "content": "Mike Johnson, Speaker of the House visits the New York Stock Exchange to deliver an economic address in New York City, U.S., October 1, 2024. REUTERS/Kent J. EdwardsFormer Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, are among the many right-wing conservatives who are supporting Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the United States' 2024 presidential election -- a group that also includes former Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL), former Mike Pence national security aide Olivia Troye, and former Trump White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham.Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), once a Liz Cheney ally, remains a staunch Donald Trump supporter. Johnson has said that he and Cheney have \"agreed to disagree\" over whether or not Trump is a threat to democracy.But according to Axios reporter Juliegrace Brufke, Johnson and the former congresswoman recently \"engaged in a tense text exchange.\"Brufke, in an article published on October 21, wrote, \"Cheney disputed Johnson's characterization of the exchange, telling Axios that she and the speaker 'used to be friends, but we did not 'agree to disagree.' Zoom in: Johnson said he had not spoken to Cheney in a 'very long time,' but decided to text her after 'she said some very uncharitable things.'\"\nFormer Rep. Cheney, during an NBC News appearance on October 13, warned, \"I do not have faith that Mike Johnson will fulfill his constitutional obligation.\"Unlike many other far-right MAGA Republicans, Johnson is not known for inflammatory rhetoric and has a reputation for being polite to political opponents -- at least publicly. And he has sometimes been described as soft-spoken.Johnson told Axios he was \"disappointed\" that Liz Cheney chose to \"make things personal, because I've not done that.\"The House speaker added, \"We had a little debate in conversation, on text message, back and forth and agreed to disagree.\"\nBut Cheney told Axios, \"Had Mike been acting as a lawyer representing Trump, he would have been sanctioned, disbarred or indicted for taking those positions -- just as several Trump lawyers were. The courts, including several conservative judges appointed by Trump, rejected each legal argument Mike makes. Mike does not have constitutional authority to overrule the courts. Ignoring those rulings is tyranny Trump's own White House lawyers testified against him.\"The former Wyoming congresswoman continued, \"Trump's campaign lawyers testified against him. Trump's Justice Department officials testified against him. So did his VP. If Trump is somehow elected, neither Mike nor anyone else will be able to control him.\"",

The Democrat is ahead by six points in Georgia and the slimmest of margins in Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.Trump has also taken the lead over Harris for the first time in Pennsylvania in FiveThirtyEight's aggregation of polls.As the campaign enters its last two weeks, Harris is touring the Rust Belt states while Trump is visiting North Carolina, still recovering from the devastation of Hurricane Helene.Follow all the developments with our U.S. politics live blog.Trump takes lead in Pennsylvania in FiveThirtyEight forecast for the first timeDonald Trump has edged ahead of Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania for the first time in a major election forecaster.FiveThirtyEight's aggregation of polls puts Trump at 47.9 percent while Harris has 47.5.The last time Trump led in the state that could ultimately decide the election was in July, just before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race.The former president spent most of his weekend in the Keystone State and both campaigns will be spending a lot of time there in the final days.As of Monday morning, Trump was also ahead by a hair in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina.Harris had the advantage in Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada.Early in-person voting begins in seven statesEarly in-person voting began in seven states on Monday with 15 days until the election.Voters can head to the polls in Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho, North Dakota, South Carolina and Texas.Millions have already headed to the polls in states like North Carolina.More than half of voters plan to do so early, according to a NBC News poll released last week.And surveys of those who have already cast their ballot shows Harris has the advantage.Sign up to the Daily Mail's U.S. politics newsletter for the 2024 presidential electionThe 2024 presidential election could be one of the closest in history.Polls show former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are neck-and-neck during one of the most unprecedented campaigns in recent memory.The race has been dominated by assassination attempts, two drama-filled debates and President Joe Biden making the monumental decision to forgo a chance at a second term by dropping out of the race.Every day there are dramatic twists and turns that are shaping the biggest conversation in the nation: Who will be the next president?As the United States races toward Election Day on November 5, DailyMail.com is launching its first politics newsletter to keep you up to date with the most important developments.The ultimate 2024 election poll: Prediction models reveal the state of the race between Donald Trump and Kamala HarrisAhead of the 2024 Presidential election, see how Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are really faring among voters with DailyMail.com's brilliant poll tracker.Readers can view who is winning the head-to-head race as well as the situation in the battleground states that will ultimately decide who gets into the White House.All of the data used in our analysis comes from Harris versus Trump polls collated by DailyMail.com's pollsters J.L. Partners and FiveThirtyEight.Harris crushes Trump in September fundraisingKamala Harris set a record for the biggest fund-raising quarter ever this fall, raising $1 billion in the three-month period that ended Sept. 30.She significantly outraised Republican rival Donald Trump.In September alone she outraised Trump three-to-one.The Harris campaign and Democratic political committees raised over $359 million that month, while Trump and Republican-affiliated committees raised $160 million.Harris also has more cash-on-hand: $346 million compared to Trump's $283 million.It's not all about Pennsylvania: Here's how Trump and Kamala can both win the election without the crucial swing stateKamala Harris and Donald Trump have set their sights on Pennsylvania as key to victory in the presidential race. But it is not their only path to the White House.Last week, Harris visited the state twice with campaign events in Erie and Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania. Trump campaigned in Oaks, Pennsylvania, and Latrobe outside Pittsburgh.Pennsylvania with its nineteen electoral votes is the biggest of the seven battleground states that could swing either way and decide the election.And the latest polling is showing the race in a dead heat in the crucial swing state, with Trump up just half a point in the Real Clear Politics average.While the path forward to the necessary 270 electoral votes becomes much more complicated without Pennsylvania, it does not mean the race is over for either Trump or Harris.Biden proposes free over-the-counter birth controlBy Emily Goodin, senior White House correspondentPresident Joe Biden is proposing a new rule that is proposing a rule that would require private insurance to cover over-the-counter birth control pills and other contraceptives at no cost.The rule would expand a federal mandate under the Affordable Care Act that requires health insurers to cover preventative care services at no cost to patients.It would come into effect in 2025 if finalized.Reproductive rights have become a huge issue in the 2024 election and Democrats see it as a way to rally their voting base to the polls.'This rule, once finalized, will expand contraception coverage for 52 million women of reproductive age with private health insurance,' White House Gender Policy Council Director Jennifer Klein said.The five biggest spending mega-donors who have already splurged $600 MILLION on the presidential electionIn a campaign that is shattering spending records, a handful of individuals are accounting for a massive splurge that is driving the ad spending voters are seeing on billboards and smartphones in battleground states.Among them are billionaires who amassed fortunes in railroads, hedge funds, and shipping platforms.The five top mega-donors are all backing Republicans, with Donald Trump relying on their support to try to counter the edge Kamala Harris has garnered among individual contributors.Topping the list is Timothy Mellon, the grandson of leading financier and Pittsburgh native Andrew Mellon. He alone accounts for $172 million in campaign contributions, with $125 million going to the pro-Trump MAGA, Inc.He also gave $25 million to American Values 2024, which backs Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who ended his independent campaign and threw his support to Trump.The former president put him on his transition effort and said he will take on health responsibilities in a future Trump administration.Inside the only county that's predicted the last 11 presidents - and who they are voting for in the 2024 electionTucked away in the far northwest corner of country just before the cliffs drop off into the Pacific Ocean lies America's last true bellwether county.A decidedly purple place, the small, rural region of Clallam County in Washington boasts an unmatched record of voting for every presidential election winner since Ronald Reagan in 1980.This is the longest success streak of any of America's 3,143 counties.Now all eyes are on this unassuming county once again to see which way the wind is blowing for 2024, as vice president Kamala Harris faces off against former president Donald Trump in a divisive, neck and neck race.When traveling across Clallam County, the tight nature of the 2024 election is on full display.Visitors heading west into town on Highway 101 are met with a series of Harris-Walz yard signs, shortly before a massive Trump-Vance banner shows up in the same stretch of field.But while politics at a national scale have become toxic, in this small community where Democrats and Republicans have lived side by side for decades, residents have succeeded in keeping a calm head - or avoiding talking politics altogether.Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin visits Ukraine with just two weeks until the electionDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin visited Ukraine on Monday to insist the U.S. will continue its support with just two weeks until the election.The Pentagon chief announced a new $400million package of military aid to help shore up support.But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky still wants weapons that can strike deep into Russia.Austin's trip to Kyiv is likely his last under the Biden administration, and will include talks about how Ukraine can keep up its ground offensive.'We're going to continue to support Ukraine in its efforts to defend its sovereign territory,' Austin told reporters.'We've watched this fight evolve over time. And each time that it does evolve, we have risen to the occasion to meet (Ukraine's) needs to make sure that they were effective on the battlefield,' he added.Poll of 5,000 voters finds Trump and Harris tied in swing statesA large poll of 5,000 registered voters in the seven swing states that will decide the election shows Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in a tie.The Washington Post-Schar School poll find both candidates on 47 percent.The poll was taken in Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada and North Carolina.Harris fared in best in Georgia and Trump in Arizona.Kamala Harris takes huge lead on Donald Trump in key voting groupNew polling shows Kamala Harris leads Donald Trump with women over the age of 50 by more than any presidential candidate since 2016.The survey shows that 54 percent of women in that demographic plan to vote for the vice president, over just 42 percent for Trump.It's a huge improvement from Joe Biden, who only led Trump by three points with women over 50 in January.The numbers are also better than Hillary Clinton's numbers in 2016, who polled 48p percent -40 percent over Trump.AARP, who conducted the survey, believes that women over 50 can potentially sway the election.CBS hits back at Trump claim the network 'deceitfully edited' Kamala Harris' 60 Minutes interviewCBS denied allegations it 'deceitfully edited' a longwinded answer Kamala Harris gave during a 60 Minutes interview - but admitted airing a 'more succinct' portion of her response.The controversy began when the vice president sat for an interview that aired last Monday on the flagship program and was asked about the Israeli invasion of Gaza.Her verbose answer, riddled with long pauses and hesitant wording, was played during a 60 Minutes preview that aired on CBS Face the Nation last Sunday.However, when the whole interview was broadcast on 60 Minutes the next evening, Harris appeared to give a more succinct answer.Has this make-up free Ivanka Trump photo revealed a major twist in the 2024 election?An innocuous photo of a make-up free Ivanka Trump may have provided a major hint that her father has repaired relations with Nikki Haley as the election winds down.Haley, the former ambassador to the UN, gave her endorsement to Former President Trump in May but has been absent on the campaign trail - while admitting their personal relationship remains frosty.However, multiple outlets recently reported that the Trump camp is wooing Haley to help shore up the former president's standing with women.On Saturday, a thaw between Haley and Trump appeared to take shape when the former South Carolina governor liked an Instagram photo posted by Ivanka.The former presidential advisor and First Daughter posted a makeup-free photo with her family celebrating the Jewish holiday Sukkot.",

About 7 in 10 say the nation is going in the wrong direction.But the findings reaffirm that Trump has lost what had been an advantage on the economy, which many voters say is the most important issue this election season above abortion, immigration, crime and foreign affairs.\"Do I trust Trump on the economy? No. I trust that he'll give tax cuts to his buddies like Elon Musk,\" said poll respondent Janice Tosto, a 59-year-old Philadelphia woman and self-described independent.An AP-NORC poll conducted in September found neither Harris nor Trump had a clear advantage on handling \"the economy and jobs.\" But this poll asked more specific questions about whether voters trusted Trump or Harris to do a better job handling the cost of housing, jobs and unemployment, taxes on the middle class, the cost of groceries and gas, and tariffs.▶ Read more about the poll.Trump takes questions at a barbershop in the BronxDonald Trump went to a barbershop in the Bronx section of New York for a segment with commentator Lawrence Jones that aired Monday on \"Fox & Friends.\"He took questions from clients at the business about immigration, energy and taxes. The barbers wore a black shirt with the phrase \"Make Barbers Great Again.\"Featured Local SavingsOne of the clients asked Trump if, once he generated enough revenue with some of his proposals, it would be possible to eliminate federal taxes.\"There is a way. There is a way,\" Trump said, adding that in the 1890s, people did not have to pay income taxes.The business owner, who leases the building, told him his main challenge was paying for his energy bill, which had shot up from $2,100 to $15,000 in the last seven months.\"What?\" Trump said. \"How many heads can you take care of? That's a lot.\"Trump asked how much average hair cuts cost and how much they had gone up. He was told they had gone up from a range between $12 and $15 to between $30 and $40.Toward the end of the visit, Trump told the men \"you guys are the same as me. It's the same stuff. We were born the same way.\"Some Jewish voters in presidential swing states reconsider their longtime devotion to DemocratsFor Rona Kaufman, the signs are everywhere that more Jews feel abandoned by the Democratic Party and may vote for Republican Donald Trump.It's in her Facebook feed. It's in the discomfort she observed during a question-and-answer at a recent Democratic Party campaign event in Pittsburgh. It's in her own family.\"The family that is my generation and older generations, I don't think anybody is voting for Harris, and we've never voted Republican, ever,\" Kaufman, 49, said, referring to Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. \"My sister has a Trump sign outside her house, and that is a huge shift.\"How big a shift? Surveys continue to find that most Jewish voters still support the Democratic ticket, and Kaufman acknowledges that she's an exception.Still, any shift could have enormous implications in Pennsylvania, where tens of thousands of votes decided the past two presidential elections.

    "title": "Biden administration proposes a rule to make over-the-counter birth control free",
    "content": "The Biden administration is proposing a rule that would expand access to contraceptive products, including making over-the-counter birth control and condoms free for the first time for women of reproductive age who have private health insurance.Under the proposal by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Labor Department, and Treasury Department, which was announced by the administration on Monday, health insurance companies would be required to cover all recommended over-the-counter contraception products, such as condoms, spermicide and emergency contraception, without a prescription and at no cost, according to senior administration officials.It would also require private health insurance providers to notify recipients about the covered over-the-counter products.The proposed rule comes as the Biden administration seeks to expand access to contraceptives and as other reproductive health, including access to abortion, has become a central issue in the 2024 presidential election campaign. Republican-led states have restricted access to abortion since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. About half of states now ban or severely restrict abortion, which has coincided with steep declines in prescriptions for birth control and emergency contraception in those states.HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said when health care insurers impose burdensome administrative or cost sharing requirements for services, \"access to contraceptives become even more difficult.\"\"We have heard from women who need a specific brand of birth control but the cost of their prescription isn't covered by their health insurance. We have made clear that in all 50 states the Affordable Care Act guarantees coverage of women's preventive services without cost sharing, including all birth control methods approved by the Food and Drug Administration,\" Becerra told reporters. \"This proposed rule will build on the progress we have already made under the Affordable Care Act to help ensure that more women can access the contraceptive services they need without out-of-pocket costs.\"The products would be able to be accessed the same way prescription medicines are accessed, such as at the pharmacy counter, according to senior administration officials. Getting the products through reimbursement would also be an option, depending on the health insurance plan, officials said.Birth control became available to those with insurance without a copay because of the Affordable Care Act, but that required a prescription.In July 2023, a daily oral birth control pill, Opill, became the first over-the-counter birth control pill to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration. It became available for purchase online in March and can be purchased for $19.99.The Biden administration in January announced several actions aimed at strengthening access to abortion and contraceptives, including the Office of Personnel Management issuing guidance to insurers that will expand access to contraception for federal workers, families and retirees.There will be a comment period on the proposed rule and if approved, it could go into effect in 2025, according to senior administration officials.However, if former President Donald Trump wins the election, he could reverse the rule.",

What is unusual is for those friends to be Karlie Kloss and Phoebe Gates, a pair of multimillionaires in the millennial and Gen Z age brackets, each with her own name recognition -- and in Kloss's case an entire media company. The women are the executive producers of Everybody's Fight: An In Bloom Series, set to release on YouTube on October 22, just days ahead of the 2024 presidential election.\"I think we all know what's at stake, but I think  understand in a more personal way the day-to-day implications on millions of people's lives -- whether you're somebody living in a state with a complete ban, or a ban of any kind -- and the barriers that exist to seek vital care,\" Kloss told Vanity Fair, speaking along with Gates over Zoom.Gates, the 22-year-old daughter of Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates, is an activist with a special focus on reproductive rights and climate justice, and has cofounded an as-yet-unreleased digital fashion platform. Kloss, a former model, owns Bedford Media with her husband, Joshua Kushner (the brother of Jared Kushner, who is the son-in-law of Donald Trump, who orchestrated the fall of Roe v. Wade -- in case you forgot). As a teenager in her native Missouri, Kloss volunteered as a care escort for Planned Parenthood patients, and in 2022 founded the Gateway Coalition, a collective that helps with access to abortion in the Midwest.She and Gates consulted with experts in the space -- like Jessica Valenti, who writes about abortion in her newsletter, \"Abortion, Every Day,\" and Kwajelyn Jackson, the executive director of Atlanta's Feminist Women's Health Center -- and dove into the data to determine \"how to be of the highest impact and support the landscape\" on a hot-button issue that changes on a near-daily basis.\"Especially young people, young voters like ourselves who might not be reading the long, in-depth storytelling, but are on socials -- how can we reach them where they are and tell them about what's happening?\" Kloss says.\"Honestly, we're only beginning to understand all the ways that ending the federal right to abortion is affecting people's lives, and we wanted to support films that paint a true picture of reproductive freedom today in the US and what a better future could look like,\" Gates says. \"From my perspective, my generation is about to have less rights than all the generations that came before us. And there's 40 million of us, or 41 million Gen Z eligible voters in this election.\" She calls this messaging play, which has MTV's Staying Alive Foundation as another partner, \"only one piece of the puzzle.\"",

Turnout by party has historically leaned heavily in favor of Democrats, who have accounted for roughly half or more of the state's early voters in each of the past four presidential elections.However, Republicans held a slight edge on day one of early voting this year. They totaled 75,455 votes to 74,311 for Democrats. \"Other\" voters accounted for 27,166 votes.Another early trend: Far more women voted early than men in Louisiana, with 102,178 showing up on day one. That was 31% more than their male counterparts.Black early voter turnout in Louisiana was down on day one from four years ago. They cast one-fourth of all ballots Friday compared with nearly one-third in 2020. Over the entire early period in 2020, Black voters made up nearly 30% of all voters.The high mark over an entire early voting period in Louisiana was set four years ago with 986,428 for the presidential race between Joe Biden and Donald Trump.Louisiana governor's elections have drawn far fewer people during the early voting period when compared to presidential election years. Just less than 369,000 showed up for the October 2023 primary that Jeff Landry won outright.In the much closer 2019 governor's election, more than 503,000 voters participated in the runoff between John Bel Edwards and Eddie Rispone, up from approximately 386,000 in the primary.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",

    "content": "Pennsylvania has the biggest Jewish population of any swing state, and any shift could have enormous implications in a state decided by narrow margins the past two presidential electionsSome Jewish voters in presidential swing states reconsider their longtime devotion to DemocratsBy MARC LEVYAssociated PressThe Associated PressHARRISBURG, Pa.HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- For Rona Kaufman, the signs are everywhere that more Jews feel abandoned by the Democratic Party and may vote for Republican Donald Trump.It's in her Facebook feed. It's in the discomfort she observed during a question-and-answer at a recent Democratic Party campaign event in Pittsburgh. It's in her own family.\"The family that is my generation and older generations, I don't think anybody is voting for Harris, and we've never voted Republican, ever,\" Kaufman, 49, said, referring to Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. \"My sister has a Trump sign outside her house, and that is a huge shift.\"How big a shift? Surveys continue to find that most Jewish voters still support the Democratic ticket, and Kaufman acknowledges that she's an exception.Still, any shift could have enormous implications in Pennsylvania, where tens of thousands of votes decided the past two presidential elections. Many Jewish voters say the 2024 presidential election is like no other in memory, coming amid the growing fallout from Hamas' brutal attack on Israelis last year.Jews represent a sliver of the voting-age population in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, the so-called blue wall of states that Democrats have come to rely on in recent presidential elections. In a close election, they are a big enough constituency that the campaigns of Harris and Trump see the potential for any slippage to swing a close contest.That has forced Harris to walk a line between traditional Democratic constituencies with strong feelings about the war in Gaza, both Jews and Arab Americans -- balancing support for Israel with outrage over the deaths of Israeli and Palestinian civilians and destruction in the region. The Biden administration has been pressuring Israel to end its attacks, which continued last week with the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by Israeli troops.Trump has looked to exploit the opening among Jewish voters especially, saying Harris \" doesn't like \" Jewish people, Jews who don't vote for him \"need their head examined \" and that he'll be the \" best friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the White House.\"In the past, surveys have shown that Jews overwhelmingly vote Democratic. A Pew Research Center poll released last month found that about two-thirds of Jewish voters back Harris. In 2020, about 7 in 10 Jewish voters supported President Joe Biden, according to AP VoteCast.The question is whether that has changed, as Jews now see Israel's survival in a new light as its war with Hamas widens to Hezbollah and possibly Iran.That has put a new focus on the relationship between Israel and the U.S., which continues to provide military aid. And many Jews say rising acts of antisemitism in the United States and anti-Israel protests sweeping across cities and college campuses -- including in Philadelphia -- have made them feel unsafe.In Pennsylvania, still fresh in many minds is a gunman absorbed by white supremacist ideology murdering 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018, the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.As Pennsylvania plays a central role in the election, many say they've never seen such outreach from campaigns as they have now.From Trump on down, Republicans are attempting to win over Jewish voters by highlighting a Democratic Party torn between its traditional and unconditional support for Israel and a growing faction that has accused Israel of war crimes in Gaza, called for Israel to unconditionally stop attacking Hamas, and demanded that the U.S. end its military support for Israel.For some Jews who typically vote Democratic, that has resonated.\"I think that there are folks who are reluctant Trump voters who feel scared as Jews in this country,\" said Jeremy Kazzaz, a Pittsburgh resident and Harris supporter.Kazzaz, however, said Harris has a long record of fighting antisemitism that is relatively unknown to many voters.He pointed out that the Biden administration tapped her husband, Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, to lead a task force to develop a strategy to fight antisemitism well before Hamas attacked Israel. Emhoff has been a key surrogate, campaigning in front of Jewish audiences in the Philadelphia suburbs and speaking at the groundbreaking of a new complex replacing Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue.Still, where Harris' supporters see strong support of Israel -- for instance, the Biden administration sent a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery to Israel, along with the troops needed to operate it -- others see conditional support.That includes Biden urging Israel not to hit Iran's nuclear program or oil fields. At the same time, Biden has stressed his administration's support for Israel and, in her remarks on the anniversary of Hamas' attack, Harris said she'll \"always ensure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself and that I will always work to ensure the safety and security of the Jewish people here and around the world.\"Steve Rosenberg, of Philadelphia, who voted for Trump in 2016 and then Biden in 2020, will vote for Trump in 2024. In large part, Rosenberg sees Biden's lifting of Trump-era sanctions on Iran as providing the cash for the Islamic Republic to finance a war against Israel. Trump imposed the sanctions after voiding a treaty the Obama administration had reached to slow Iran's progress toward nuclear weapons, which he called a bad deal.\"The question is, 'Who is better off today than four years ago?'\" Rosenberg said. \"And the answer is Iran and the mullahs and their proxies, and it's because Biden and Kamala Harris have capitulated to Iran.\"Kaufman, a self-described progressive who lives in Pittsburgh's heavily Jewish Squirrel Hill neighborhood, never thought she would vote for Trump.But now, she expects Trump will continue a hardline stance against Iran -- which she calls an imminent threat to democracy, human rights and western civilization -- and worries that Harris will appease Iran and pander to the party's left wing.Jews with very strong connections to Israel -- her parents were born there and her daughter just finished a two-year eight-month mandatory service with the Israeli army -- are similarly conflicted over supporting Harris, Kaufman said. \"I'm saying it out loud everywhere, but most people aren't saying it out loud.\"Many Jews who support Harris, however, say they see Trump as a threat to democracy.That's important, they say, because minorities -- including Jews -- have reason to fear persecution under dictators.They can unfurl a list of comments by Trump that they see as threatening: using the military against domestic enemies, peddling dual-loyalty tropes about Jews, setting up Jews as scapegoats if he loses and, in the days after Hamas' attack, criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while praising Hezbollah as \"very smart.\"\"That's the conversation that I'm having with Jews,\" said Rabbi Beth Janus of Philadelphia.Janus said Jews she knows are excited that a woman could be president and that she's married to a Jewish man. Conversely, Trump's support for Israel is transactional, she said.\"When it serves his needs, his objectives, he supports Israel,\" Janus said. \"But if it didn't, then he wouldn't support Israel.\"",

    "content": "Former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyoming) and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, are among the many right-wing conservatives who are supporting Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the United States' 2024 presidential election -- a group that also includes former Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Illinois), former Mike Pence national security aide Olivia Troye, and former Trump White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, among others. Liz Cheney has even spoken at some of Harris' campaign rallies.Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana), once a Liz Cheney ally, remains a staunch Donald Trump supporter. Johnson has said that him and Liz Cheney have \"agreed to disagree\" over whether or not Trump is a threat to democracy. But according to Axios reporter Juliegrace Brufke, Johnson and the former congresswoman recently \"engaged in a tense text exchange.\"Brufke, in an article published on October 21, explained, \"Cheney disputed Johnson's characterization of the exchange, telling Axios that she and the speaker 'used to be friends, but we did not 'agree to disagree.' Zoom in: Johnson said he had not spoken to Cheney in a 'very long time,' but decided to text her after 'she said some very uncharitable things.'\"\nFormer Rep. Cheney, during an NBC News appearance on October 13, warned, \"I do not have faith that Mike Johnson will fulfill his constitutional obligation.\"Unlike many other far-right MAGA Republicans, Johnson is not known for inflammatory rhetoric and has a reputation for being polite to political opponents -- at least publicly. And he has sometimes been described as soft-spoken.Johnson told Axios he was \"disappointed\" that Liz Cheney chose to \"make things personal, because I've not done that.\"The House speaker added, \"We had a little debate in conversation, on text message, back and forth and agreed to disagree.\"\nBut the arch-conservative Liz Cheney told Axios, \"Had Mike been acting as a lawyer representing Trump, he would have been sanctioned, disbarred or indicted for taking those positions -- just as several Trump lawyers were. The courts, including several conservative judges appointed by Trump, rejected each legal argument Mike makes. Mike does not have constitutional authority to overrule the courts. Ignoring those rulings is tyranny Trump's own White House lawyers testified against him.\"The former Wyoming congresswoman continued, \"Trump's campaign lawyers testified against him. Trump's Justice Department officials testified against him. So did his VP. If Trump is somehow elected, neither Mike nor anyone else will be able to control him.\"",

    "content": "WASHINGTON (Reuters): The Biden administration is proposing a rule that would provide women with private insurance access to over-the-counter birth control pills and other contraceptives at no cost, the White House said on Monday.The rule, which expands a federal mandate requiring health insurers to cover preventative care services at no cost to patients under the Affordable Care Act, is being proposed by the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and the Treasury and would come into effect in 2025 if finalized.\"This rule, once finalized, will expand contraception coverage for 52 million women of reproductive age with private health insurance,\" White House Gender Policy Council Director Jennifer Klein said during a briefing.\"For the first time ever, women would be able to obtain over-the-counter contraception without a prescription at no additional cost, and health plans would have to cover even more prescribed contraceptives without cost sharing,\" she said.Perrigo Co's Opill is currently the only daily birth control pill approved for sale without a prescription by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but the proposed rule covers other forms of over-the-counter contraceptives, including emergency contraception such as morning after pill Plan B, spermicides, birth control sponges, and condoms.The rule will also require that health plans cover all FDA-approved contraceptive drugs and some devices, including IUDs, without cost sharing in many cases.The rule will also require health plans to cover every FDA-approved contraceptive drug or drug-led combination product, such as IUDs, without cost sharing unless the plan also covers a therapeutic equivalent without cost sharing, and would require plans to disclose that OTC contraceptives are covered with cost sharing or a prescription.The proposal comes just two weeks before the 2024 presidential election, in which abortion rights has been a key issue following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v Wade in 2022. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, has made access to abortion central to her campaign.Republican rival former President Donald Trump has bragged about appointing three of the conservative justices who made the ruling but has since said abortion laws should be determined by U.S. states, stopping short of proposing a national ban that could imperil his chances with swing voters in the November election.",

    "title": "The Constitution is the star of Stage West Theatre's season opener",
    "content": "With weeks until the 2024 presidential election, Stage West Theatre opens its 2024-2025 season with a play and a debate about America's celebrated founding document. Heidi Schreck's What the Constitution Means to Me runs at the Fort Worth theatre through November 3.\"It's such a celebration of democracy,' said Dana Schultes, Stage West's Executive Producer and director of the show.Stage West's production is the regional premiere of this Pulitzer Prize finalist. The Tony-nominated show and Obie Award winner for Best New American Play is the most produced play in America. Schultes hopes it will get people talking.\"Live theatre is a way to bring people together for conversation and so when you have an opportunity to prompt civic engagement, I find it to be a responsibility as a theater-maker if there's something that does that to engage with it,\" Schultes said.During this contentious political moment, this play focuses on the foundational concept of American society and what kind of nation Americans want in the future.\"This particular play eschews a lot of the noise,\" Schultes said. \"Those are things that steal our conversation when there are things that perhaps if we would collectively look more deeply at systemic issues that really do have meaningful widespread impact, we could work together to think about what we want our society to look like.\"The play centers on Heidi who as a high schooler put herself though college by winning debate competitions about the Constitution. As an adult, Heidi revisits the impact of the founding document on her life. Megan Noble plays Heidi.\"It really is a memory play in many ways,\" Noble said. \"It's that excitement of going back to that time and 'What did I love about the Constitution?' and 'What did it mean to me back then?' and then starting to ask questions of, 'Wow, I saw things this way, but now that I'm older and these things happened and I have more information and I also have more life experience, I now see things a little differently.' And without saying this is the way, it's her working through that. It's her curiosity and fascination with how her history relates to her present moment.\"The play shows Heidi's evolving perspective of history.\"There is an innocent look at the world that she just accepted what she was told as fact and made connections because that was what she was taught in school, but not necessarily digging deep because of her own trauma in her past,\" Noble said. \"As she gets older, there is this, 'As I weave in my own personal experience and allow that to impact the way I see history, I am now a little bit gutted by the fact that by looking truth squarely in the face, I now unveiled a whole world of truth I denied the existence of as a 15-year-old.'\"The second part of the play is a debate between a local teenage debater and the adult Heidi. The audience will select the winner.\"It's interesting because it is an actual debate,\" Schultes said. \"It is: 'Should we abolish the Constitution or not?' That's it. It's live. It's fresh. We don't know who's going to debate which side each night.\"Through working on the show, Noble engaged with history in a way that she did not when she was a student, becoming an inquisitive mother of four sons.\"It's been very meaningful for me and makes me ask my boys, 'What are you learning in history?'\" Noble said.For Schultes, the play sparks a conversation about how well the Constitution represents women and minority populations and what that lack of representation means for American society nearly 250 years since its founding. She is excited that her teenage daughter is bringing friends to the show.\"Every time that I engage with it, it pulls back another layer of something I haven't really considered before,\" Schultes said. \"There are things that are brought up in this play that sort of shake my foundation as a human being and I am so very much wanting to share them with other people so other people can think about what it means.\"What the Constitution means to Noble is complicated.\"I'm conflicted about the Constitution. The people who made it were flawed human beings and there is so much good that has come from it. At the same time, it is incomplete. I do not feel represented as a woman in that document. There is still not an equal rights amendment, which is hard to believe,\" Noble said. \"It is a thorough document, but it lacks what Heidi talks about in the play as active rights, protecting all people on the planet.\"More than two centuries later, Benjamin Franklin's wisdom remains relevant.\"The Constitution, to me, is our best chance for continued democracy for all of us living in America - if we can keep it,\" Schultes said.",

    "title": "2024 US Presidential polls set to see most political violence since 1970s: Report",
    "content": "In York, Pennsylvania, a man accosted a group of people rallying for Vice President Kamala Harris' White House campaign, punching a 74-year-old man in the head and calling another man a \"n -- supporter\" as he fled.In northern Michigan, an assailant enraged by his hatred of Donald Trump used an all-terrain vehicle to run over and injure an 81-year-old man who was putting up a yard sign for the former president's reelection bid.The recent attacks were among at least 300 cases of political violence identified by Reuters since Trump's supporters stormed the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, including at least 51 incidents this year. With just two weeks to go before the Nov. 5 presidential election, the cases are part of the biggest and most sustained increase in US political violence since the 1970s.Some of the violence has been reported widely, most notably two assassination attempts on Trump, a Republican. Other high-profile incidents include three shootings in recent weeks at a Democratic campaign office for Harris in Arizona.But Reuters documented scores of other cases on contentious political issues - from election disputes to LGBTQ+ rights and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Incidents ranged from small fights over political signs to more violent brawls and property destruction at rallies. Most of this year's violence wasn't fatal with the exception of two deaths: a spectator killed during July's attempt on Trump's life and the shooter.The pace of cases has remained remarkably consistent since beginning to rise in 2016, around the time of Trump's first presidential run. In 2021, which included the tumult that followed Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election, there were 93 cases of political violence, followed by 79 in 2022, and 73 in 2023.Political extremism experts warn that the charged atmosphere around the 2024 presidential election has created a highly volatile situation. Trump in particular often uses incendiary rhetoric, threatening to put his political enemies on trial and to deploy the military against the \"radical left\", calling them \"the enemy within.\"Americans are starting to see violence as \"part of the way politics happens,\" said Nealin Parker, who heads Common Ground USA, a nonprofit that studies ways to bridge America's political and cultural divides. In the current climate of mistrust, she added, \"incidents of violence can metastasize into something bigger.\"Robert Pape, a University of Chicago professor who studies political violence, expressed concern over the prospect of post-election violence in battleground states, where the margin of victory could be a few thousand votes. He likened it to \"a wildfire season\" with lots of \"dry combustible material\" and the \"potential for lightning strikes.\"Trump himself has declined to rule out the possibility of violence if he loses in November. When asked by Time magazine in April if he expected violence after the election, he said, \"If we don't win, you know, it depends.\" He has told supporters that any loss in this year's race would be due to fraud.The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment. The Trump campaign, when asked about the steady rise of political violence and the recent attacks against Harris and Trump supporters, provided a statement attacking Harris on immigration and criminal justice reform.'Doing my part'The highest-profile case of recent political violence was the first assassination attempt on Trump at a July 13 campaign rally in Pennsylvania. The shooter, Thomas Crooks, was killed at the scene. He had no \"definitive ideology,\" federal investigators concluded.Law enforcement agencies were put on alert for potential retaliatory violence by Trump supporters. There were some concerning incidents, including a man in Florida who told his wife he was \"preparing for war\" after the shooting and left home with multiple guns, according to police reports. He was found burying a full ammunition box in a public park. Police seized seven rifles and handguns, and had the man hospitalized for a mental health evaluation.But the anger wasn't confined to Trump's supporters.\nKemppainen, 22 and unemployed, went on a vandalism spree eight days later in his town of Hancock, population 4,500, which mostly backed Trump in the 2020 election.On July 21, when President Joe Biden quit the presidential race and endorsed Harris, Kemppainen rode an all-terrain vehicle through the streets and targeted Trump supporters, said Hancock Police Department chief Tami Sleeman in an interview.Reuters pieced together what happened from police reports obtained in a records request, copies of chat messages provided by Kemppainen's associates and police, and a video Kemppainen posted on Discord.He vandalized a pickup truck with a Trump sticker, deflating its tires, tearing off a side mirror and smashing its windows. He also damaged a truck with a pro-police decal. He posted a video of one attack on Discord with the comment \"doing my part.\" Then he tore up Trump yard signs and threw them into the street.When an onlooker, Carl Nelson, 81, replanted the signs, Kemppainen ran him over with the ATV and fled, hospitalizing the Vietnam veteran.The next day, Kemppainen rang Hancock Police: \"I am calling to confess to a crime,\" he said in a message describing his rampage, according to a recording police shared with Reuters. \"So if you could send someone to pick me up. I appreciate it.\"When police heard the voicemail two hours later, they worried the caller sounded unbalanced and dispatched six officers, said Sleeman, the chief. By the time they arrived, Kemppainen had fatally shot himself with an assault rifle, a police report said. His father said Kemppainen was on anti-depression medication and also had an autism diagnosis, the report added. In an interview, a family member confirmed that Kemppainen struggled with mental health issues.Nelson, who Kemppainen attacked, told Reuters he spent several days in the hospital for knee and upper body injuries. \"This was such a peaceful area,\" said Nelson. He has decided to vote for Trump, he added.On Sept. 15, a second assassination attempt on Trump refocused attention on the risk of political violence in this year's election. Suspect Ryan Routh had waited for hours with an assault rifle by Trump's golf course in West Palm Beach when an agent spotted him in shrubbery and fired. Routh fled and was apprehended quickly.Eleven days later, in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, Alan Vandersloot, a 74-year-old local borough councilman, stood with a Harris sign among about a dozen of her supporters at a rally in York, a city of nearly 45,000 in a county that broadly backed Trump in 2020.As the rally was ending, Vandersloot told Reuters, a man grabbed him from behind and slammed him to the pavement, opening a two-inch gash on his forehead. The attacker, Robert Trotta, punched Vandersloot repeatedly before fleeing, two witnesses said in interviews.When another rallygoer, Dan Almoney, gave chase, Trotta called him \"a n -- supporter,\" Almoney said. Almoney interpreted the slur as a reference to Harris and her backers, he said. Trotta, Vandersloot and Almoney are white.Trotta, unable to post bail, has yet to make a plea on assault and harassment charges, court records show. His lawyer declined to comment. Trotta is a registered Republican, according to state records. His social media posts, from an account last active in 2020, supported Trump and criticized Democrats.A York City Police Department spokesperson, Captain Daniel Lentz, said he didn't believe Trotta's attack was \"politically motivated\" because Trotta previously pleaded guilty to two cases of harassment in which he struck random people. The police report, however, did not include statements from Vandersloot and Almoney, who both said they believed the attack was political. Lentz said he didn't know why the police didn't record their accounts.New issues, new violenceThere's no government data on political violence, though several universities and private research groups track it in various ways, typically using databases built on news accounts. Some include random hate crimes; others, including Reuters, do not. Most have not released comprehensive data since 2020.The 300 cases identified by Reuters were culled from records on thousands of violent crimes since the 2021 Capitol attack. Most of that data was captured initially by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, a global violence-tracking project run by a nonpartisan research group in Wisconsin. Reporters identified additional cases using news databases, court filings and police reports obtained through public records requests.Some of the cases don't break down along traditional partisan lines, including those linked to disputes over the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.That was the case last month when Caleb Gannon, a pro-Palestinian critic of US government support for Israel, began heckling a pro-Israel rally in Newton, Massachusetts. Cell phone video shows Gannon shouting, \"You're supporting genocide!\" before running into the crowd and tackling Scott Hayes, a fervent backer of Israel.Earlier this year, Hayes, an Iraq War veteran, posted a photo on social media of a handgun with a Star of David pendant and the message \"Hey Jew Haters. Bring it.\" As they wrestled on the ground, Hayes shot Gannon in the abdomen.Hayes, 47, is awaiting trial after pleading not guilty to assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. The county prosecutor has said an assault and battery charge also will be pursued against Gannon, 31, who remains hospitalized. Hayes' lawyer said he will argue self-defense but declined further comment.Other cases are directly linked to the election.On Sept. 26, a Michigan man was arrested for assaulting a US Postal Service worker who delivered a Harris campaign mailer to his house. The postal worker was in her truck when Russell Valleau, 61, approached on a bike, yelling that he \"did not want that 'Black bitch' in his mailbox,\" according to police records and a statement from the Oakland County prosecutor.When the postal worker, who is Black, told Valleau to back away, he called her a \"Black bitch\" and lunged at her with a knife, according to her account to the Farmington Hills Police Department. She sprayed him with dog repellent, and he retreated. \"I just had a man come to me with a knife and try to stab me,\" she said moments later in a call to police, according to a recording obtained through a records request. \"I sprayed him.\"Police reported finding Valleau lying in a nearby yard, apparently intoxicated and suffering the effects of chemical repellant. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of assault and battery and ethnic intimidation. His lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.In another case this summer, four white men in a pick-up truck rolled up to a rural home in coastal North Carolina and asked three Black teens in the yard \"if they liked Donald Trump,\" according to a report from the Pasquotank County Sheriff's Office. When the youths said, \"No,\" the report said, the men opened fired with a BB gun, hitting one youth in the leg and another in the buttocks. The shots also broke windows on the house, a shed and a car out front.The truck drove off. Police are investigating the case as an assault with a deadly weapon and have no suspects. The children suffered minor injuries and declined medical treatment.Christian Gilyard, the youths' father, said political tensions have become more pronounced since the contested 2020 election, but he never expected problems in his own neighborhood. \"It's shocking,\" he said, \"that something like this would happen here.\"",

    "title": "News flash: Trump is Uncle Sam!",
    "content": "To understand what's unfolding in this election year, we need to view Trump not only as a candidate, and not merely as a man, but as a symbol -- as if he were the personification of Uncle Sam brought to life in an attempt to save America from a passel of formidable enemies, both foreign and domestic, that seek to destroy her.Simply put: this election is between a return to the America we loved and lost in the Color Revolution of 2020, and the last phase of a Communist takeover of our nation, as predicted by Khrushchev back in the 1950's: \"We will take America without firing a shot... we will destroy you from within.\"That's the only way to begin to comprehend the Progressive Left's myriad strategies to either keep Trump off the ballot, send him to prison, or worse -- disenfranchising We the People in our attempt to elect the man who best represents the American Republic -- the leader of the MAGA movement.In fact, it is not Trump per se, but the MAGA movement -- the awakened Sleeping Giant -- that the Dems and their globalist pals really fear. Their attacks on Trump are attacks on We the People. Their lawfare against him is their corruption of our justice system, depriving us of any hope of justice as well. That's also their message regarding the illegal detaining of patriots for \"trespassing\" on January 6th.They're in control -- they've already hijacked the Constitution.Remember when Hillary advised Biden in 2020 to refuse to concede \"no matter what\"? That was her \"wink, wink, nudge, nudge\" way of saying: Steal the election! Perhaps by using truckloads of fake ballots, fake vote counts, no holds barred, to cheat one's way into office -- elections be damned.The Dems' definition of \"democracy\"? They win.They're hellbent on getting their way. And their way is to get Obama at least virtually back into the White House to finish the job he started of \"fundamentally changing America,\" through the fatal combination of empty vessel Kameleon Harris, she of the meaningless word salad to hide her stunning ignorance of...well...nearly everything -- as well as her total inability to think on her feet -- and her low IQ but radically Leftist support person, Tim Walz.TRUMP'S SOARING POPULARITY TERRIFIES THE LEFTYou have only to watch a replay of President Trump's rally last May in the Bronx, smack dab in true blue New York, to see why the Dems fear him. After almost four years of Doddering Dementia Joe obediently following Obama's Marxist playbook, with inflation skyrocketing, gas prices and food prices hammering the middle and working classes, people have caught on.They remember they were better off under Trump!It seems everything the Desperadoes do backfires against them, including the assassination attempt against Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13th. The colossal failure of the O'Biden/Harris administration to provide adequate security for a former president and likely winner of the current election is a national disgrace.Not only that, but the failed assassination attempt only made Trump stronger and more popular than ever! He even had the chutzpah to hold a second rally in Butler Pennsylvania. The man is fearless!And at his recent rally in California -- a state not even considered in play -- he drew a crowd of 50,000 people!The Dems are panicking at Trump's continued rise in popularity. Their lawsuits against him are crumbling -- people can see the charges are both phony and pathetic. The Dems do nothing but cheat, and deep down, Americans hate cheaters.This may also be why Kamala is widely considered the most unlikeable candidate in American presidential politics -- even besting the Hildebeast in that regard -- and why it's no surprise that she plagiarized whole segments of her grossly mistitled book Smart on Crime -- but I digress....THE DEMS' ELECTION WARGAMESIt's obvious by now the Dems have figured out that even the alleged mail-in ballot scam, including truckloads full of fake ballots and alleged rigged vote-counting algorithms may not be enough to steal this election. So, deep in the bowels of the Leftist enclave of Georgetown University, they've been busily hatching another strategy: Plan B.Tucker Carlson's guest -- author, veteran and expert analyst J. Michael Waller unveiled it on TCN several months ago. It turns out a group of renegade lawyers and retired Generals war-gamed this election, the way the participants of Event 201 war-gamed the Covid lockdown response. Says Waller: \"... according to their latest war games, if Donald Trump wins a free and fair election, he still has to be removed.\"Let that sink in!They're planning to use lawfare to keep him out of the White House even after he wins the election! And if that doesn't work, a military coup!The good news is that a stalwart member of the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Pete Sessions, is investigating the nefarious Georgetown plotting that apparently went on in 2020 and 2022, and has ramped up all the more for this make-or-break election.Says Sessions, \"As our nation prepares for the 2024 presidential election, the work of TIP has been brought to my attention as an intensely partisan exercise intended to sew  dissension and subversion regarding the American election system and the institution of the president of the United States.\"And according to The New York Sun:Mr. Sessions also spotlights another Georgetown affiliate, the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protections, known as \"ICAP.\" That is led by Professor Mary McCord.Says McCord: \"We're already starting to put together a team to think through the most damaging types of things that he  might do so that we're ready to bring lawsuits if we have to.\"Ready with lawsuits against a duly elected President? What country do they think this is? Ah, I forgot we've been living in their Marxist \"utopia\" ever since their successful Color Revolutionary coup d'état against Trump in 2020. And now they must be stopped from perpetrating their second -- and final -- coup against America, or it's game over for the We the People.A vote for Donald Trump is far more than a vote for a man. In the face of the myriad assaults against our people, our liberty and our sovereignty -- signs of the Leftist globalist elites' final push for their totalitarian \"One World Government\" -- it is a vote for America! © Cherie Zaslawsky",

    "content": "Four years of Donald Trump's false claims about a stolen 2020 election have kindled growing suspicion of voting machines among conspiracy theorists. One of their solutions is to replace the tabulators that count every vote with people who will do that by hand.Four years of Donald Trump's false claims about a stolen 2020 election have kindled growing suspicion of voting machines among conspiracy theorists. One of their solutions is to replace the tabulators that count every vote with people who will do that by hand.Controversies over the issue have flared periodically in pockets of the country before the 2024 presidential election even though research has shown that hand-counting is more prone to error, costlier and likely to delay results.The few counties that have attempted the massive task have found the process more time-consuming, expensive and inaccurate than expected.In Texas' Gillespie County, a hand-count of Republican primary election ballots this year stretched into the early morning hours, taking almost 24 consecutive hours with 200 people counting ballots, the Texas Tribune and VoteBeat reported. The hand-count cost taxpayers about double the wage costs of the 2020 Republican primary and involved fixing a series of errors, the news nonprofits reported.In rural Nye County, Nevada, where volunteers in 2022 embarked on an unprecedented full hand-count of midterm votes, mismatched tallies led to recount after recount. After the first day of counting, the county clerk, Mark Kampf, estimated a discrepancy of nearly 25% between the hand and machine count, attributing it to human counting error. The painstakingly slow process was halted by the state's Supreme Court over concerns that early vote tallies could be leaked publicly.Shasta County, a conservative rural county in northern California, last year abandoned plans to hand-count ballots after the plan was estimated to cost $1.6 million and require more than 1,200 additional employees.Still, some jurisdictions continue to call for hand-counting.Most recently, Georgia's State Election Board voted to require poll workers to count the number of paper ballots, but not the votes, by hand after voting is completed. But the rule was blocked Oct. 15 by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney.A 'grassroots' movementSome Republicans, inspired by election lies claiming that widespread fraud cost Trump reelection in 2020, have pushed for hand-counting ballots and banning the electronic tabulators used to scan ballots and record votes, despite no evidence of widespread fraud or major irregularities.\"This movement could have died if it had just been a flash in the pan from the 2020 election,\" said Charles Stewart, a political science professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But conspiracy theorists such as election denier and MyPillow founder Mike Lindell have traveled the country working \"to create a grassroots social movement around this skepticism,\" Stewart said.While these conspiracy theories are not common nationwide, they have found a stubborn hold in pockets of the country, \"primarily in the deepest red parts of the deepest red states,\" Stewart said.Problems with cost, speed and accuracyThe hand-counting of ballots threatens to delay results by days, weeks or even months, depending on jurisdiction and staffing. Swapping machines with hand-counts would not only be slower but also increase the chances for mistakes and fraud, research has shown.In a New Hampshire study, poll workers who counted ballots by hand were off by 8%, compared with a 0.5% error rate for machine counting.\"Human beings are really bad at tedious things, and counting ballots is among the most tedious things we could do,\" Stewart said. \"Computers are very good at tedious things. They can count very quickly and very accurately.\"Paper ballots already usedTrump and other Republicans have called for the use of paper ballots in this year's election. In fact, paper ballots or paper records of every vote already are produced in nearly every state.The Brennan Center at New York University estimates that 98% of all votes nationwide will be cast on paper in this year's presidential election.Paper ballots also are used in postelection, hand-count audits to identify any irregularities with ballot scanning and counting and to ensure the machine results are accurate. Election officials also conduct accuracy testing on the machines before every election.Susannah Goodman, director of election security at Common Cause, said informing voters of the checks already in place can help reduce the fear and distrust at the center of calls for hand-counting ballots.\"If you show voters the process and all of the steps that are taken to ensure the outcome is correct -- not just tell, show -- they gain confidence,\" she said.Elections Voting systems are easy to blame, but are hard to hack and tested for accuracy CHRISTINA A.

One of their solutions is to replace the tabulators that count every vote with people who will do that by hand.Controversies over the issue have flared periodically in pockets of the country before the 2024 presidential election even though research has shown that hand-counting is more prone to error, costlier and likely to delay results.The few counties that have attempted the massive task have found the process more time-consuming, expensive and inaccurate than expected.In Texas' Gillespie County, a hand-count of Republican primary election ballots this year stretched into the early morning hours, taking almost 24 consecutive hours with 200 people counting ballots, the Texas Tribune and VoteBeat reported. The hand-count cost taxpayers about double the wage costs of the 2020 Republican primary and involved fixing a series of errors, the news nonprofits reported.In rural Nye County, Nevada, where volunteers in 2022 embarked on an unprecedented full hand-count of midterm votes, mismatched tallies led to recount after recount. After the first day of counting, the county clerk, Mark Kampf, estimated a discrepancy of nearly 25% between the hand and machine count, attributing it to human counting error. The painstakingly slow process was halted by the state's Supreme Court over concerns that early vote tallies could be leaked publicly.Shasta County, a conservative rural county in northern California, last year abandoned plans to hand-count ballots after the plan was estimated to cost $1.6 million and require more than 1,200 additional employees.Still, some jurisdictions continue to call for hand-counting.Most recently, Georgia's State Election Board voted to require poll workers to count the number of paper ballots, but not the votes, by hand after voting is completed. But the rule was blocked Oct. 15 by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney.A 'grassroots' movementSome Republicans, inspired by election lies claiming that widespread fraud cost Trump reelection in 2020, have pushed for hand-counting ballots and banning the electronic tabulators used to scan ballots and record votes, despite no evidence of widespread fraud or major irregularities.\"This movement could have died if it had just been a flash in the pan from the 2020 election,\" said Charles Stewart, a political science professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But conspiracy theorists such as election denier and MyPillow founder Mike Lindell have traveled the country working \"to create a grassroots social movement around this skepticism,\" Stewart said.While these conspiracy theories are not common nationwide, they have found a stubborn hold in pockets of the country, \"primarily in the deepest red parts of the deepest red states,\" Stewart said.Listen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our PodcastsProblems with cost, speed and accuracyThe hand-counting of ballots threatens to delay results by days, weeks or even months, depending on jurisdiction and staffing.

    "title": "What's in Your AI? California Thinks You Should Know",
    "content": "Member of the board, UCLA Daily Bruin Alumni Network; advisory board, Center for Ethical Leadership in the MediaWhile California Governor Gavin Newsom drew attention in the past month for saying no to a comprehensive AI safety law that would have called for an AI kill switch, the state did pass 17 gen AI-related bills covering deepfakes, AI watermarking, child safety, election misinformation and performers' rights regarding their digital likeness.For those interested in what goes into the training data - the billions of bits of content and data being fed into large language models (LLMs) - let me point you to AB 2013, which Newsom did sign. The bill requires that AI companies, on or before Jan. 1, 2026, provide a \"high-level summary\" of the datasets used to train their systems, including the sources and owners of the data and whether the data was licensed or purchased by the AI company.That's kind of a big deal since publishers, including The New York Times, are suing OpenAI and Microsoft, arguing that their AI model is built from AB 2013, which applies to systems released in or after January 2022, also requires AI developers to say whether the training data includes personal information, the dates when the data became part of the system and \"the time period during which the data in the datasets were collected, including a notice if the data collection is ongoing.\"Crazy thought: What if AI companies, hoping to gain the trust of consumers and publishers, voluntarily released information about their training data ahead of the deadline? I'm not holding my breath.Here are some other doings in AI worth your attention.With US elections just two weeks away, remember to pause before believing or resharing content about candidates, issues and even the integrity of the election process. Because just as Russian disinformation groups used social media to influence voters and spread disinformation in the 2016 and 2020 elections, bad actors, including Russia, are using generative AI tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT to mislead US voters.Who says? OpenAI for one. In a 54-page report released this month, the company said it's \"disrupted more than 20 operations and deceptive networks from around the world that attempted to use our models\" since the start of 2024 that were intended to trick and confuse voters. Those threats ranged from writing articles for websites to creating social media posts shared by \"fake personas.\"\"Activities ranged in complexity from simple requests for content generation, to complex, multi-stage efforts to analyze and reply to social media posts,\" OpenAI said.There was some good news. While \"threat actors continue to evolve and experiment with our models, but we have not seen evidence of this leading to meaningful breakthroughs in their ability to create substantially new malware or build viral audiences,\" the company wrote. \"It is noteworthy that ... the deceptive activity that achieved the greatest social media reach and media interest was a hoax about the use of AI, not the use of AI itself.\" Details of the hoax can be found on page 20.How big a deal are the concerns about AI and the elections? Americans - both Democrats and Republicans - said they're worried that AI will be used mostly for \"bad purposes,\" the Pew Research Center noted in a September report. A majority of adults (57%) said they're extremely or very concerned that groups will try to influence the election using AI \"to create and distribute fake or misleading information about the candidates and campaigns.\"And while more than three-fourths of US adults believe tech and social media companies \"have a responsibility to prevent the misuse of their platforms to influence the 2024 presidential election,\" only 20% say they are very or somewhat confident that these companies will actually be able to prevent their products from being misused, Pew added.Sigh.So quoting Mad-Eye Moody from the Harry Potter universe, remember that constant vigilance will be required on your part as you sift through voter information (that may be written by AI bots), videos and audios (that may turn out to be AI-generated deepfakes) and even seemingly trivial posts that may try to plant a seed of doubt in your mind about vote counts.The Wired AI Elections Project is tracking AI use in this election cycle, noting that \"2024 is already an unprecedented year for democracy: More than 2 billion people - the largest number ever - will vote in national, local, and regional elections in more than 60 countries.\" And several other reputable groups, including the Brennan Center for Justice, the News Literacy Project and its RumorGuard alert program, FactCheck.org and NewsGuard, can help you suss out what's real from fake about this year's elections.As I wrote last week, companies including OpenAI, Meta and Google have announced they're developing AI tools that let you create hiqh-quality videos from simple text prompts or from a single photo or image.Count Adobe first out of the gate with a public beta of its Adobe Firefly Video Model after having a set of creatives experiment with its text-to-video and image-to-video systems in September. You can watch demos of what the video looks like and how it's being used by those early users.To help temper the concerns of filmmakers and creators worried that such tools will undermine their work, Adobe notes that it has licenses to all the video content its AI models have been fed, or trained on.\"Just like our other Firefly generative AI models,\" the company wrote in a blog post, \"Adobe Firefly Video model is designed to be commercially safe and is only trained on content we have permission to use - never on Adobe users' content.\"The public beta comes ahead of OpenAI's Sora, which is due sometime this year, and Meta's recently announced Movie Gen text-to-video creator, which can create 16-second videos. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, in a post created with the tool, wrote that it will be available to the public in Instagram next year. To also show it's taking concerns by creatives into account as it develops its powerful video engine, Meta last week announced that it's collaborating with the Blumhouse production company - \"a driving force in horror\" - and a small group of filmmakers, including award-winning actor Casey Affleck, to get \"creative industry feedback\" on these tools.\"The thing that has surprised me the most about it, and that has been the most enjoyable, is how it's more like a collaborator than it is like a tool,\" Affleck says in a Meta promo video.Meanwhile, Microsoft, which in July said it wants the government to pass a law to protect against deepfake fraud, filed a patent application for \"providing live image generation based on audio transcription.\"\"Microsoft mentions in the document that this AI-powered system converts live audio (during meetings or conferences, for example), and then a language model summarizes that. And then, with this summary, the system creates an AI-generated image,\" reports MSPowerUser, which spotted the Oct. 10 patent application first.After watching the number of visits to its site rise and fall throughout 2023, ChatGPT is now leader of the pack: It's seen traffic to its site climb steadily over the past five months. Visits more than doubled in September to a record 3.1 billion visits, according to researcher Similarweb.\"That makes ChatGPT (chatgpt.com) the #11 website by worldwide traffic - not in the same league as google.com (82 billion visits) or youtube.com (28 billion), but ahead of amazon.com (2.6 billion, although that doesn't count Amazon's international domains),\" Similarweb said.In the chatbot market, ChatGPT's closest rival in terms of traffic in the US is Microsoft's Bing.com, which had under 2 billion visits in September. Google's Gemini was the third most-visited chatbot, with 274.7 million visits, the researcher said.The news comes just weeks after OpenAI made history by raising an eye-popping $6.6 billion in investor funding, which valued the company at a robust $157 billion.Is AI the answer to your money problems? CNET's Kelly Ernst set out to find out in her report on how budget-conscious folks are using chatbots to help make better spending decisions. She includes a guide to popular AI apps and use cases based on insight from financial experts.A month after Microsoft said it had signed a deal to power its data centers with the help of the nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island, Amazon and Google both announced nuclear energy plans to help feed expected demand for all the AI compute power they'll need. Amazon said it's investing $500 million in developing nuclear technologies. Google said it signed an agreement to buy nuclear energy from small modular reactors being developed by Kairos Power.The government's adoption of AI is paying off, seriously. The US government said its use of AI - not gen AI, but machine learning - helped \"recover $1 billion worth of check fraud in 2024 alone,\" reported CNN, which got the scoop from the Treasury Department.

His remarks are expected at 12 p.m.Immediately after, Trump will travel east to hold a rally in Greenville. The event will take place at Williams Arena at Minges Coliseum, located at 200 Ficklen Drive.Doors will open at 11 a.m., with the rally set to begin at 3 p.m.This rally comes at a crucial time as the latest national NBC News poll shows a tight race between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.In an NBC News poll conducted Oct. 4-8, Harris gets support from 48% of registered voters in a head-to-head matchup - while Trump gets an identical 48%. Another 4% say they are undecided or wouldn't vote for either option.As the 2024 presidential election heats up, North Carolina remains a battleground state. Trump's visit to Greenville underscores the importance of voter turnout in the state, which could play a pivotal role in determining the outcome of the election.The state hasn't been won by a Democratic candidate since Barack Obama in 2008. In support of Democrats, former President Obama will be in Charlotte Friday, encouraging early voting.Early voting in North Carolina continues through Nov. 2, with Election Day set for Nov. 5.",

    "title": "Counting by hand: Suspicion of tabulators fuels a push for slower, more costly process",
    "content": "Four years of Donald Trump's false claims about a stolen 2020 election have kindled growing suspicion of voting machines among conspiracy theorists. One of their solutions is to replace the tabulators that count every vote with people who will do that by hand.Controversies over the issue have flared periodically in pockets of the country before the 2024 presidential election even though research has shown that hand-counting is more prone to error, costlier and likely to delay results.The few counties that have attempted the massive task have found the process more time-consuming, expensive and inaccurate than expected.In Texas' Gillespie County, a hand-count of Republican primary election ballots this year stretched into the early morning hours, taking almost 24 consecutive hours with 200 people counting ballots, the Texas Tribune and VoteBeat reported. The hand-count cost taxpayers about double the wage costs of the 2020 Republican primary and involved fixing a series of errors, the news nonprofits reported.People are also reading...Catfish Charlie's announces it is closing the doors in Moline Miller-Meeks' Davenport apartment linked to donor New riverfront hotel, restaurant, event center proposed for vacant downtown Davenport lot Iowa State drops in AP Poll after 38-35 win against UCF More John Deere workers in the Quad-Cities to be laid off in January Man throws punch at his attorney in Rock Island County courtroom Welcoming new businesses: Restaurant openings, ribbon cuttings around the Quad-Cities Two wounded by gunfire as they were driving in Davenport Arrowhead to hold yard sale as it gets rid of remaining items Erin Ruchotzke Bettendorf planning major project to widen Middle Road; new amenities at Forest Grove Park See trick-or-treat times for Quad-Cities and surrounding areas Some Quad-Cities colleges see increases, some see decreases in 2024 fall enrollment IOWA PREP FOOTBALL: Bettendorf adds to resume with crazy overtime victory Five takeaways from Iowa State's win against UCF to improve to 7-0 for the first time since 1938In rural Nye County, Nevada, where volunteers in 2022 embarked on an unprecedented full hand-count of midterm votes, mismatched tallies led to recount after recount. After the first day of counting, the county clerk, Mark Kampf, estimated a discrepancy of nearly 25% between the hand and machine count, attributing it to human counting error. The painstakingly slow process was halted by the state's Supreme Court over concerns that early vote tallies could be leaked publicly.Shasta County, a conservative rural county in northern California, last year abandoned plans to hand-count ballots after the plan was estimated to cost $1.6 million and require more than 1,200 additional employees.Still, some jurisdictions continue to call for hand-counting.Most recently, Georgia's State Election Board voted to require poll workers to count the number of paper ballots, but not the votes, by hand after voting is completed. But the rule was blocked Oct. 15 by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney.A 'grassroots' movementSome Republicans, inspired by election lies claiming that widespread fraud cost Trump reelection in 2020, have pushed for hand-counting ballots and banning the electronic tabulators used to scan ballots and record votes, despite no evidence of widespread fraud or major irregularities.\"This movement could have died if it had just been a flash in the pan from the 2020 election,\" said Charles Stewart, a political science professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But conspiracy theorists such as election denier and MyPillow founder Mike Lindell have traveled the country working \"to create a grassroots social movement around this skepticism,\" Stewart said.While these conspiracy theories are not common nationwide, they have found a stubborn hold in pockets of the country, \"primarily in the deepest red parts of the deepest red states,\" Stewart said.Problems with cost, speed and accuracyThe hand-counting of ballots threatens to delay results by days, weeks or even months, depending on jurisdiction and staffing. Swapping machines with hand-counts would not only be slower but also increase the chances for mistakes and fraud, research has shown.In a New Hampshire study, poll workers who counted ballots by hand were off by 8%, compared with a 0.5% error rate for machine counting.\"Human beings are really bad at tedious things, and counting ballots is among the most tedious things we could do,\" Stewart said. \"Computers are very good at tedious things. They can count very quickly and very accurately.\"Paper ballots already usedTrump and other Republicans have called for the use of paper ballots in this year's election. In fact, paper ballots or paper records of every vote already are produced in nearly every state.The Brennan Center at New York University estimates that 98% of all votes nationwide will be cast on paper in this year's presidential election.Paper ballots also are used in postelection, hand-count audits to identify any irregularities with ballot scanning and counting and to ensure the machine results are accurate. Election officials also conduct accuracy testing on the machines before every election.Susannah Goodman, director of election security at Common Cause, said informing voters of the checks already in place can help reduce the fear and distrust at the center of calls for hand-counting ballots.\"If you show voters the process and all of the steps that are taken to ensure the outcome is correct -- not just tell, show -- they gain confidence,\" she said.Voting systems are easy to blame, but are hard to hack and tested for accuracyCHRISTINA A.

    "title": "Taylor Swift trolled by Trump supporter before Florida concert: 'Cat Lady'",
    "content": "Popstar Taylor Swift was dragged by a troll -- apparently a fan of presidential hopeful Donald Trump -- in an elaborate stunt involving a personal message delivered by plane on Sunday.A small aircraft flying above the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, Florida, shortly before the singer was due to perform was towing a banner reading: \"Trump 2024 - Ready For It, Cat Lady? MAGA!\"The phrase \"ready for it\" appears to be a play on the star's hit song \"...Ready For It?\" released in 2017.Meanwhile, the offensive slur \"cat lady\" was famously used by Trump's running mate JD Vance, who slammed \"childless cat ladies\" in a misogynistic rant against Kamala Harris and others who do not have children.Swift, who does not have children and has three pet cats, later publicly endorsed Harris with a post on Instagram, archly signing off her message, \"Childless Cat Lady.\"It is not known who organised the plane stunt targeting Swift and her fans at the weekend, but the \"MAGA\" note at the end refers to the Trump-supporting 'Make America Great Again' movement.Concert-goers waiting to enjoy the star's Eras Tour filmed the plane from inside the stadium and the clips were later widely shared online by MAGA enthusiasts.One post, uploaded by a user on X (formerly Twitter) named Tony, who describes himself as an \"America First\" patriot who was once retweeted by Trump, went viral.The footage he posted of the plane was viewed more than 1 million times and was shared by almost 5,000 X users.Tony captioned the clip: \"LOL!!! Someone flew a banner over Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour in Miami that said: \"TRUMP 2024 - READY FOR IT, CAT LADY? MAGA!\" Absolutely incredible.\"Newsweek has reached out by email to Trump's representatives and is attempting to contact Swift's management for comment.Swift, 34, officially endorsed Harris last month, writing: \"I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election.\"I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.  Childless Cat Lady.\"Her post was seen as a significant boost for Harris and Democrats hoped to capitalize on it. Florida Democrats were working with the \"Swifties for Kamala\" outreach group over the weekend to encourage concert-goers to cast their votes, according to digital political news outlet Politico.Florida Democratic Party spokesperson Eden Giagnorio said: \" holds immense power to get out the vote. We hope our organizing efforts will help voters connect the dots -- but nothing compares to her advocacy around it.\"However, some voting experts believe that high-profile endorsements such as Swift's make little difference at the ballot box, with one poll suggested it may even have hurt Harris' campaign.In any case, as the November 5 presidential election draws ever closer, both sides will be ramping up their efforts in a last-ditch attempt to win over voters and ensure their supporters take the time to cast their ballots.A closing line from Swift's \"...Ready For It?\" song perhaps sums things up. \"Let the games begin,\" she sings.",

    "title": "He started his career in RI. Now, here's how CNN's John King will get through Election Day",
    "content": "How many cups of coffee do you need to get through election night?\"I would run out of fingers,\" says CNN anchor and chief correspondent John King. \"I start early in the morning, and I just keep going.\"King, who grew up in Dorchester, Massachusetts, graduated from the University of Rhode Island in 1985. After graduating, he worked for the Associated Press bureau in Providence, where, he told a URI publication in 2021, if you were covering Rhode Island politics \"it was like getting paid every day to go to Disney World.\"In the inaugural Taricani Lecture on First Amendment Rights in 2021, hosted by URI's Harrington School of Communication and Media, King recalled his relationship with WJAR-TV investigative reporter Jim Taricani. He said despite Taricani's reputation as a hard-nosed journalist, Taricani helped King, a 21-year-old reporter straight out of college, and took time to offer compliments. \"You have no idea how much that means and how much that could impact the early days of your career,\" King said in the lecture.Now, the CNN Anchor and Chief National Correspondent admits it's actually the adrenaline that powers him through the grind and keeps him awake for hours at stretch.\"Let's just be honest, anyone who does this for a living (will say) the adrenaline kicks in,\" King tells USA TODAY over video call from his home. \"Yes, I drink a lot of coffee, probably too much coffee during election week, but it's also just adrenaline. This is this is what I do. This is my passion.\"Ties to RI: 25 famous alumni from RI colleges and universities. Emma Watson is just the start.Preparing for the election: 'It's not going to be one night'While adrenaline, passion and a little bit of \"fun\" get King through election coverage, the veteran journalist is well aware of the responsibilities that come with the job.\"I take it on myself (the responsibility), especially in this age where people are constantly questioning the integrity of our elections and the integrity of our news media,\" King says. \"That raises the preparation bar for me, and it makes me constantly think about not only am I prepared, but how do I communicate? There are people out there who don't trust you, or people on the sidelines trying to get them not to trust you. The importance of clarity in communication and trust in your brand, both my personal brand, and then the broader CNN brand is just critical.\"In the months leading up to the election, King has been doing it all. The CNN anchor stepped away from his role as the anchor of \"Inside Politics,\" in April 2023, handing the torch to Dana Bash, to \"take on a new role focused on voters in battleground states during the 2024 presidential election,\" according to an April 2023 CNN news release.King tells USA TODAY that he's been on ground and traveling across the country for the last 15 months and will continue to do so up until the week before the election.\"Study, prepare (and) be ready physically,\" King adds. \"Because it's not going to be one night, it's not going to be one long day, it's all the work up to the election. In 2024, we know at least roughly what's coming, and so you prepare for it. And again, that's a mix of journalism, work and studying, and a mix of making sure that you're in as good a form as you can be when it comes to being on TV time.\"The weekend before the election, however, he plans to spend with his 13-year-old son, who he shares with Bash.\"MS is a challenge, but everybody has challenges,\" King says. \"I take pride in it. It's my life. It's part of my challenge. I'm actually motivated by it in a strange way. It just makes me work harder. It makes me think more. The things that most trigger my MS, sometimes (are) random, but the normal triggers are heat and stress and intense physical strain. And they all come together in election week.\"King shares he makes sure he exercises daily, even if that means waking up at the crack of dawn to hit the hotel gym before starting the work day, keeping a check on his diet and always keeping his meds stocked up wherever he goes.\"It's a range, and it depends,\" says King. \"I'm very, very lucky of those who have MS. I'm on the lucky spectrum (but) it's with me every day. It bothers me every day, it challenges me every day, but I'm able to function, and that's part of my routine.\"The anchor explained that it's usually his thighs that are most affected by MS and he \"can't feel from my thighs down.\"\"I haven't felt from the thighs down since Bill Clinton was President,\" he jokes.To maintain good shape and ensure his body can endure the physical stress that comes with covering the election, King says he trains on the treadmill besides incorporating \"more leg work\" such as squats and light-medium weights. While on the road, King says he does a lot of outdoor walking if the weather's nice and seeing \"all over these great places we visit.\"\"Ask me after the election if I did the right thing or if I screwed myself up,\" King jokes.'Magic wall' prepares for the electionWhile King prepares, his famous \"magic wall\" that became a celebrity on social media during the last election cycle \"is at the beach having a couple of nice, fun frozen drinks just to rest up and relax.\"\"It'll fly back soon, and it'll be ready,\" King jokes. \"I always joke (that) sometimes I do treat it as a person. People on set think I'm a little crazy when I start talking to it, but it is a remarkable, revolutionary invention.\"Describing the \"magic wall\" as \"the most powerful information tool\" he's ever worked with,\" King says the software brings everything to his fingertips and helps present information to viewers in an interactive and transparent manner.\"It's just a fascinating tool in every election cycle with the help of an amazing team, we try to make it better,\" King says.King said one of his biggest takeaways from being on ground and covering election cycles is that people \"enjoy the journey,\" and the \"magic wall\" gives him the opportunity to take his viewers to different parts of the country and give them an insight into the voting process there.King explains the \"magic wall\" is also a way of ensuring transparency and winning audiences' trust.\"Everything has to be transparent,\" King says. \"Every major institution is under attack in some way, and that's unfortunate, in my view, but it is the reality you live in. I think that trust is the coin of the realm.\"Winning audience trustIn that case, how does King aim to win the trust of his audiences and ensure that the information he is relaying is accurate?\"That is where some preparation comes in handy,\" says King. \"I hope that my preparation is good enough for me to say, well, let's wait a minute before we report that. If you have any question about what you're seeing, don't share it with the people until you know.\"King also took the moment to remind voters to be patient as results trickle in, explaining that each states counts votes in different ways and until all the results are in, nothing is definitive.\"The early map might look funny, might look different,\" King says. \"But we don't have the full picture yet. We only have a tiny slice of the pie. Let's be patient here. What you see tonight might not be the end. This might take a few days.\"After the electionsOnce the election is and done and dusted and America has a new president, King plans on decompressing at the beach, but he doesn't have anything set in stone, given the unpredictability of the outcome.\"I don't have anything planned, because we don't know what's going to happen, right?\" says King. \"We don't know how long elections going to go. There'll probably be some legal challenges, like there were last time. And so, the question is, when can you take a break?\"However, the father of three says he \"will get to a beach as soon as I can get to a beach, at least for a couple days,\" if possible. While a beach on the East Coast like Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard or Nantucket is the likelier option, King says if he has time, he would jet \"off to some exotic place.\"\"Yes, in November, it's cold, it's windy (but) I love it,\" says King. \"I love the coast in the wintertime, just to get some fresh air and just to get away and to think. But I don't know when that will be. I'm not worried about when that will be.\"",

    "title": "What changes about life in Italy in November 2024",
    "content": "From a public holiday to the enforcement of new rules for holiday lets and an income tax deadline, here's what you can expect in Italy over the coming month.Halloween isn't as big in Italy as it is elsewhere, but don't forget that the following day is a public holiday in the country.November 1st is All Saints' Day, known as Ognissanti or Tutti i Santi in Italian.It falls on a Friday this year, meaning that many people around Italy will enjoy a three-day weekend.READ ALSO: Why Italy's All Saints and All Souls days have nothing to do with HalloweenThere's little in the way of secular celebrations on this date as the holiday essentially commemorates all Christian saints and martyrs.This is not a bank holiday, but falls on a Saturday this year, meaning many people in the country will already be off work on that day.Italy's Festa dei Morti has Celtic roots and was originally celebrated in some parts of Italy on October 31st.In 1000 AD the Catholic Church named November 2nd All Souls' Day in an attempt to replace the festival with a church-approved tradition. Though the date and name were changed, plenty of fascinating old traditions have stuck in various parts of the country.November 2nd is generally a day of remembrance, with many Italians saying prayers and laying flowers on the graves of deceased loved ones.Fines for failure to comply with holiday rentals' national ID kick inOwners renting out their Italian properties for periods of 30 days or less (these are known as affitti brevi turistici, or short-term tourist lets) are required to hold a national identification code (codice identificativo nazionale, or CIN) as of September 1st 2024.However, the sanctions for failure to comply with the requirement are set to come into force on Saturday, November 2nd, with owners flouting the rules facing fines of up to €8,000.You can see a step-by-step guide on how to get an identification code for your property here.National Unity DayNovember 4th is another national holiday, though you won't get a day off work for this one.National Unity Day (or Giornata dell'Unità Nazionale e delle Forze Armate) commemorates the end of World War I for Italy in 1918.It's usually marked with major events in Rome and other cities, including flyovers by Italy's frecce tricolori jets. You can read more about the holiday here.US electionThe 2024 US presidential election will be held on Tuesday, November 5th.Americans living outside of the US, including in Italy, have a federal right to vote in the election by registering as overseas absentee voters.Voting for overseas residents started in September. If you haven't already sent in your absentee ballot, you might still have time to do so depending on your state's rules. More info here.Delayed EES introductionThe EU's new border check system (Entry/Exit System, or EES) was set to be launched on November 10th, but the start date was put off again last month amid fears of travel chaos due to unfinished infrastructure.The new official launch date is still unknown, and it likely won't be in November 2024.Winter tires deadlineUnder the Italian Highway Code, motorists are required to equip their vehicles with winter tires (or, alternatively, have snow chains on board) during the cold season.The window to make the switch opened on October 15th, but the requirement and penalties for not following it will only come into force on Friday, November 15th.After the one-month window closes, drivers breaking the rules face hefty fines plus the requirement to undergo a revisione (the Italian equivalent of a UK MOT test).The 2024-2025 ski season should be getting underway at some of Italy's higher-elevation resorts this month.The popular Madonna di Campiglio (Trentino Alto Adige) and Pontedilegno-Tonale (Lombardy) resorts are both scheduled to open on Saturday, November 16th, whereas Cortina d'Ampezzo (Veneto) and Tre Cime (Veneto/Trentino) should open on Friday, November 29th.If there's not enough snow, opening dates could be pushed back.ThanksgivingFor Americans, the fourth Thursday in November, falling on November 28th this year, is synonymous with Thanksgiving.Despite being a very important day in the US cultural calendar, the holiday is not widely celebrated in Italy.However, with a little effort it's perfectly possible to create your own authentic Thanksgiving in Italy.And if the idea of sourcing all the right ingredients for a home-cooked dinner makes you feel exhausted, or perhaps you'd like the opportunity to celebrate with a large group of fellow Americans, you can expect at least some restaurants in major Italian cities to host Thanksgiving-themed dinners.Bargains for shoppersIf you fancy some retail therapy, don't forget that Black Friday will fall on November 29th this year.You can find a full list of retailers that have announced their participation in this year's event here.The first instalment is due by June 30th, while the second one is due by Saturday, November 30th.The Italian tax office, the Agenzia delle Entrate, offers guidance (in Italian) on how to fill out and submit the form.",

    "title": "How Trump could pull off 'a real coup' if he loses to Harris: report",
    "content": "Radio host Charlamagne tha God has made a dire prediction about the United States' 2024 presidential election.If former President Donald Trump loses the electoral vote to Vice President Kamala Harris, Charlamagne warned during an interview with ITK, the \"corrupt, illegitimate\" U.S. Supreme Court will \"overturn the results\" and put Trump back in the White House anyway.MAGA Republicans have accused Charlamagne of having \"Trump derangement syndrome\" -- which is the same thing they said about \"Real Time\" host Bill Maher when, in 2020, he predicted that Trump would never admit defeat if he lost to now-President Joe Biden. But Maher's prediction proved accurate: Trump, after losing to Biden, falsely claimed, without evidence, that the election was stolen from him and did everything he could to overturn the election results.\nMoreover, a mob of Trump supporters violently attacked the U.S. Capitol Building on January 6, 2021 in the hope of preventing Congress from certifying Biden's victory.In an article published on October 21 -- only 15 days before Election Night 2024 -- Politico reporters Kyle Cheney, Heidi Przybyla, John Sakellariadis and Lisa Kashinsky lay out some scenarios in which Trump could lose to Harris in the electoral vote count but return to the White House anyway on January 20, 2025.The possible scenarios include: (1) \"sowing distrust about the results and ramping up pressure during state certification,\" (2) \"breeding distrust,\" (3) \"pressuring county and state election boards,\" (4) \"the role of lawsuits,\" (5) \"convincing Republican-led state legislatures to appoint alternate electors to send to Congress,\" (6) \"presidential electors meet in an atmosphere of threats,\" and (7) \"persuading a GOP-led Congress to endorse Trump's electors and spurn Harris' set.\"For January 6, 2025, the reporters describe a \"final move to seize power at the joint session of Congress\" and warn of a \"final move to seize power at the joint session of Congress.\"\nAccording to Cheney, Przybyla, Sakellariadis and Kashinsky, \"If Republicans, through the speaker's maneuvering, prevent either candidate from garnering an Electoral College majority, it would trigger what's known as a contingent election in the House, with each state delegation getting a single vote. Republicans control 26 state delegations to Democrats' 22, with two others evenly split. The GOP is favored to maintain that advantage, and Republicans would almost certainly choose to elect Trump president.\"Election law expert Rick Hasen, who teaches at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), discussed that type of scenario with Politico -- saying, \"Then, you're really getting into the realm of lawlessness. If people are going to be willing to just ignore the law and declare someone the winner, then you're talking about a real coup.\"",

One of their solutions is to replace the tabulators that count every vote with people who will do that by hand.Controversies over the issue have flared periodically in pockets of the country before the 2024 presidential election even though research has shown that hand-counting is more prone to error, costlier and likely to delay results.The few counties that have attempted the massive task have found the process more time-consuming, expensive and inaccurate than expected.In Texas' Gillespie County, a hand-count of Republican primary election ballots this year stretched into the early morning hours, taking almost 24 consecutive hours with 200 people counting ballots, the Texas Tribune and VoteBeat reported.

(NASDAQ: HBT) (the \"Company\" or \"HBT Financial\" or \"HBT\"), the holding company for Heartland Bank and Trust Company, today reported net income of $18.2 million, or $0.57 diluted earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2024. This compares to net income of $18.1 million, or $0.57 diluted earnings per share, for the second quarter of 2024, and net income of $19.7 million, or $0.62 diluted earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2023.J. Lance Carter, President and Chief Executive Officer of HBT Financial, said, \"In the third quarter, we continued our consistently solid financial performance with net income of $18.2 million, adjusted net income(1) of $19.2 million, adjusted ROAA(1) of 1.53% and adjusted ROATCE(1) of 17.20%. We have also seen tangible equity continue to build, with tangible book value per share increasing 23.3% over the last year. Our net interest margin (tax-equivalent basis)(1) increased 3 basis points to 4.03% while funding costs remained modest, increasing 5 basis points to 1.47%. Our asset quality remains strong with net charge-offs at 0.07% of average loans on an annualized basis during the quarter and nonperforming assets to total assets at 0.17%. We have not seen any significant signs of stress in our loan portfolio, but we continue to monitor the portfolio closely. Noninterest income remained consistent and noninterest expense of $31.3 million was up only 2.1% when compared to the third quarter of 2023, as we remain focused on operational efficiency while continuing to invest in our business. Lastly, all capital ratios had solid increases and can support future organic growth or acquisitions.\"____________________________________(1) See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most closely comparable GAAP financial measures.\ndelivered to your inbox \nAdjusted Net IncomeIn addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company believes non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, which adjust for acquisition expenses, branch closure expenses, gains (losses) on closed branch premises, net earnings (losses) from closed or sold operations, charges related to termination of certain employee benefit plans, realized gains (losses) on sales of securities, and mortgage servicing rights fair value adjustments, provide investors with additional insight into its operational performance. The Company reported adjusted net income of $19.2 million, or $0.61 adjusted diluted earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2024. This compares to adjusted net income of $18.1 million, or $0.57 adjusted diluted earnings per share, for the second quarter of 2024, and adjusted net income of $20.3 million, or $0.63 adjusted diluted earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2023 (see \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" tables below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most closely comparable GAAP financial measures).Net Interest Income and Net Interest MarginNet interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $47.7 million, an increase of 1.5% from $47.0 million for the second quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to improved loan yields which were mostly offset by an increase in funding costs.Relative to the third quarter of 2023, net interest income decreased 1.1% from $48.3 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher funding costs which were partially offset by higher asset yields and an increase in interest-earning assets.Net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 3.98%, compared to 3.95% for the second quarter of 2024, and net interest margin (tax-equivalent basis)(1) for the third quarter of 2024 was 4.03%, compared to 4.00% for the second quarter of 2024. Higher yields on interest-earning assets, which increased by 7 basis points to 5.35%, were mostly offset by an increase in funding costs, with the cost of funds increasing by 5 basis points to 1.47%.Relative to the third quarter of 2023, net interest margin decreased 9 basis points from 4.07% and net interest margin (tax-equivalent basis)(1) decreased 10 basis points from 4.13%. These decreases were primarily attributable to increases in funding costs outpacing increases in interest-earning asset yields.____________________________________(1) See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most closely comparable GAAP financial measures.Noninterest IncomeNoninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $8.7 million, a decrease from $9.6 million for the second quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to changes in the mortgage servicing rights (\"MSR\") fair value adjustment, with a $1.5 million negative MSR fair value adjustment included in the third quarter 2024 results compared to a $0.1 million negative MSR fair value adjustment included in the second quarter 2024 results. Partially offsetting the MSR fair value adjustment was a $0.2 million increase in service charge income and a $0.2 million increase in other noninterest income, primarily attributable to swap fee income.Relative to the third quarter of 2023, noninterest income decreased 8.3% from $9.5 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to the $1.5 million negative MSR fair value adjustment included in the third quarter 2024 results, partially offset by the absence of $0.8 million in realized losses on the sale of securities included in the third quarter 2023 results.Noninterest ExpenseNoninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $31.3 million, a 2.7% increase from $30.5 million for the second quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to a $0.5 million increase in occupancy expense, driven in part by a seasonal increase in planned building maintenance expenses, and a $0.4 million increase in marketing and customer relations expense.Relative to the third quarter of 2023, noninterest expense increased 2.1% from $30.7 million. The increase was primarily attributable to a $0.7 million increase in salaries and a $0.4 million increase in employee benefits. Partially offsetting these increases was a $0.3 million decrease in marketing and customer relations expense.On February 1, 2023, HBT Financial completed its acquisition of Town and Country Financial Corporation (\"Town and Country\") with the core system conversion successfully completed in April 2023. Acquisition-related expenses recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 are summarized below. No Town and Country acquisition-related expenses were recognized subsequent to the second quarter of 2023.(dollars in thousands) Nine Months EndedSeptember 30, 2023Total loans outstanding, before allowance for credit losses, were $3.37 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with $3.39 billion at June 30, 2024, and $3.34 billion at September 30, 2023. The $15.7 million decrease from June 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to several larger commercial real estate loan payoffs due to the sale of the property and a couple of larger one-to-four family residential loan payoffs. These decreases were partially offset by increased line usage and term originations in our agricultural and farmland portfolio.DepositsTotal deposits were $4.28 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with $4.32 billion at June 30, 2024, and $4.20 billion at September 30, 2023. The $38.0 million decrease from June 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to lower balances maintained in retail accounts and a $18.3 million decrease in escrow balances related to seasonal tax payments, partially offset by increases in public funds and business accounts. Additionally, we continue to see a shift towards higher cost deposit products, with decreases in noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing demand, and savings balances being partially offset by an increase in money market and time deposit balances.Asset QualityNonperforming loans totaled $8.2 million, or 0.24% of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared with $8.4 million, or 0.25% of total loans, at June 30, 2024, and $6.7 million, or 0.20% of total loans, at September 30, 2023. Additionally, of the $8.2 million of nonperforming loans held as of September 30, 2024, $2.0 million is either wholly or partially guaranteed by the U.S. government. The $0.2 million decrease in nonperforming loans from June 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to the payoff of $0.1 million in nonaccrual agricultural and farmland loans.The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $0.6 million for the third quarter of 2024. The provision for credit losses primarily reflects a $1.2 million increase in required reserves resulting from changes in economic forecasts; a $0.2 million increase in required reserves resulting from qualitative factor changes; a $0.6 million decrease in required reserves driven by decreased loan balances and changes within the loan portfolio; and a $0.2 million decrease in specific reserves.The Company had net charge-offs of $0.6 million, or 0.07% of average loans on an annualized basis, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to net charge-offs of $0.7 million, or 0.08% of average loans on an annualized basis, for the second quarter of 2024, and net recoveries of $0.1 million, or 0.01% of average loans on an annualized basis, for the third quarter of 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, net charge-offs were primarily recognized in the commercial and industrial category which had $0.7 million of net charge-offs.The Company's allowance for credit losses was 1.22% of total loans and 499% of nonperforming loans at September 30, 2024, compared with 1.21% of total loans and 484% of nonperforming loans at June 30, 2024. In addition, the allowance for credit losses on unfunded lending-related commitments totaled $4.1 million as of September 30, 2024, compared with $4.3 million as of June 30, 2024.CapitalAs of September 30, 2024, the Company exceeded all regulatory capital requirements under Basel III as summarized in the following table:September 30, 2024 For CapitalAdequacy PurposesWith CapitalConservation BufferTotal capital to risk-weighted assets 16.54% 10.50%Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 14.48 8.50 Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 13.15 7.00 Tier 1 leverage ratio 11.16 4.00 The ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets(1) increased to 9.35% as of September 30, 2024, from 8.74% as of June 30, 2024, and tangible book value per share(1) increased by $0.91 to $14.55 as of September 30, 2024, when compared to June 30, 2024.During the third quarter of 2024, the Company did not repurchase shares of its common stock under its stock repurchase program. The Company's Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $15 million of HBT Financial common stock under its stock repurchase program, which is in effect until January 1, 2025.

One of their solutions is to replace the tabulators that count every vote with people who will do that by hand.Four years of Donald Trump's false claims about a stolen 2020 election have kindled growing suspicion of voting machines among conspiracy theorists. One of their solutions is to replace the tabulators that count every vote with people who will do that by hand.Controversies over the issue have flared periodically in pockets of the country before the 2024 presidential election even though research has shown that hand-counting is more prone to error, costlier and likely to delay results.The few counties that have attempted the massive task have found the process more time-consuming, expensive and inaccurate than expected.In Texas' Gillespie County, a hand-count of Republican primary election ballots this year stretched into the early morning hours, taking almost 24 consecutive hours with 200 people counting ballots, the Texas Tribune and VoteBeat reported. The hand-count cost taxpayers about double the wage costs of the 2020 Republican primary and involved fixing a series of errors, the news nonprofits reported.People are also reading...

After the first day of counting, the county clerk, Mark Kampf, estimated a discrepancy of nearly 25% between the hand and machine count, attributing it to human counting error. The painstakingly slow process was halted by the state's Supreme Court over concerns that early vote tallies could be leaked publicly.Shasta County, a conservative rural county in northern California, last year abandoned plans to hand-count ballots after the plan was estimated to cost $1.6 million and require more than 1,200 additional employees.Still, some jurisdictions continue to call for hand-counting.Most recently, Georgia's State Election Board voted to require poll workers to count the number of paper ballots, but not the votes, by hand after voting is completed. But the rule was blocked Oct. 15 by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney.A 'grassroots' movementSome Republicans, inspired by election lies claiming that widespread fraud cost Trump reelection in 2020, have pushed for hand-counting ballots and banning the electronic tabulators used to scan ballots and record votes, despite no evidence of widespread fraud or major irregularities.\"This movement could have died if it had just been a flash in the pan from the 2020 election,\" said Charles Stewart, a political science professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But conspiracy theorists such as election denier and MyPillow founder Mike Lindell have traveled the country working \"to create a grassroots social movement around this skepticism,\" Stewart said.While these conspiracy theories are not common nationwide, they have found a stubborn hold in pockets of the country, \"primarily in the deepest red parts of the deepest red states,\" Stewart said.Listen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our PodcastsProblems with cost, speed and accuracyThe hand-counting of ballots threatens to delay results by days, weeks or even months, depending on jurisdiction and staffing. Swapping machines with hand-counts would not only be slower but also increase the chances for mistakes and fraud, research has shown.In a New Hampshire study, poll workers who counted ballots by hand were off by 8%, compared with a 0.5% error rate for machine counting.\"Human beings are really bad at tedious things, and counting ballots is among the most tedious things we could do,\" Stewart said. \"Computers are very good at tedious things. They can count very quickly and very accurately.\"Paper ballots already usedTrump and other Republicans have called for the use of paper ballots in this year's election. In fact, paper ballots or paper records of every vote already are produced in nearly every state.The Brennan Center at New York University estimates that 98% of all votes nationwide will be cast on paper in this year's presidential election.Paper ballots also are used in postelection, hand-count audits to identify any irregularities with ballot scanning and counting and to ensure the machine results are accurate. Election officials also conduct accuracy testing on the machines before every election.Susannah Goodman, director of election security at Common Cause, said informing voters of the checks already in place can help reduce the fear and distrust at the center of calls for hand-counting ballots.\"If you show voters the process and all of the steps that are taken to ensure the outcome is correct -- not just tell, show -- they gain confidence,\" she said.Elections Voting systems are easy to blame, but are hard to hack and tested for accuracy CHRISTINA A.

After the first day of counting, the county clerk, Mark Kampf, estimated a discrepancy of nearly 25% between the hand and machine count, attributing it to human counting error. The painstakingly slow process was halted by the state's Supreme Court over concerns that early vote tallies could be leaked publicly.Shasta County, a conservative rural county in northern California, last year abandoned plans to hand-count ballots after the plan was estimated to cost $1.6 million and require more than 1,200 additional employees.Still, some jurisdictions continue to call for hand-counting.Most recently, Georgia's State Election Board voted to require poll workers to count the number of paper ballots, but not the votes, by hand after voting is completed. But the rule was blocked Oct. 15 by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney.A 'grassroots' movementSome Republicans, inspired by election lies claiming that widespread fraud cost Trump reelection in 2020, have pushed for hand-counting ballots and banning the electronic tabulators used to scan ballots and record votes, despite no evidence of widespread fraud or major irregularities.\"This movement could have died if it had just been a flash in the pan from the 2020 election,\" said Charles Stewart, a political science professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But conspiracy theorists such as election denier and MyPillow founder Mike Lindell have traveled the country working \"to create a grassroots social movement around this skepticism,\" Stewart said.While these conspiracy theories are not common nationwide, they have found a stubborn hold in pockets of the country, \"primarily in the deepest red parts of the deepest red states,\" Stewart said.Listen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our PodcastsProblems with cost, speed and accuracyThe hand-counting of ballots threatens to delay results by days, weeks or even months, depending on jurisdiction and staffing. Swapping machines with hand-counts would not only be slower but also increase the chances for mistakes and fraud, research has shown.In a New Hampshire study, poll workers who counted ballots by hand were off by 8%, compared with a 0.5% error rate for machine counting.\"Human beings are really bad at tedious things, and counting ballots is among the most tedious things we could do,\" Stewart said. \"Computers are very good at tedious things. They can count very quickly and very accurately.\"Paper ballots already usedTrump and other Republicans have called for the use of paper ballots in this year's election. In fact, paper ballots or paper records of every vote already are produced in nearly every state.The Brennan Center at New York University estimates that 98% of all votes nationwide will be cast on paper in this year's presidential election.Paper ballots also are used in postelection, hand-count audits to identify any irregularities with ballot scanning and counting and to ensure the machine results are accurate. Election officials also conduct accuracy testing on the machines before every election.Susannah Goodman, director of election security at Common Cause, said informing voters of the checks already in place can help reduce the fear and distrust at the center of calls for hand-counting ballots.\"If you show voters the process and all of the steps that are taken to ensure the outcome is correct -- not just tell, show -- they gain confidence,\" she said.Elections Voting systems are easy to blame, but are hard to hack and tested for accuracy CHRISTINA A.

    "title": "Some Jewish Voters In Presidential Swing States Reconsider Their Longtime Devotion Tto Democrats",
    "content": "By MARC LEVY Associated PressHARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- For Rona Kaufman, the signs are everywhere that more Jews feel abandoned by the Democratic Party and may vote for Republican Donald Trump.It's in her Facebook feed. It's in the discomfort she observed during a question-and-answer at a recent Democratic Party campaign event in Pittsburgh. It's in her own family.\"The family that is my generation and older generations, I don't think anybody is voting for Harris, and we've never voted Republican, ever,\" Kaufman, 49, said, referring to Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. \"My sister has a Trump sign outside her house, and that is a huge shift.\"How big a shift? Surveys continue to find that most Jewish voters still support the Democratic ticket, and Kaufman acknowledges that she's an exception.Still, any shift could have enormous implications in Pennsylvania, where tens of thousands of votes decided the past two presidential elections. Many Jewish voters say the 2024 presidential election is like no other in memory, coming amid the growing fallout from Hamas' brutal attack on Israelis last year.Jews represent a sliver of the voting-age population in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, the so-called blue wall of states that Democrats have come to rely on in recent presidential elections. In a close election, they are a big enough constituency that the campaigns of Harris and Trump see the potential for any slippage to swing a close contest.That has forced Harris to walk a line between traditional Democratic constituencies with strong feelings about the war in Gaza, both Jews and Arab Americans -- balancing support for Israel with outrage over the deaths of Israeli and Palestinian civilians and destruction in the region. The Biden administration has been pressuring Israel to end its attacks, which continued last week with the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by Israeli troops.Trump has looked to exploit the opening among Jewish voters especially, saying Harris \" doesn't like \" Jewish people, Jews who don't vote for him \"need their head examined \" and that he'll be the \" best friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the White House.\"In the past, surveys have shown that Jews overwhelmingly vote Democratic. A Pew Research Center poll released last month found that about two-thirds of Jewish voters back Harris. In 2020, about 7 in 10 Jewish voters supported President Joe Biden, according to AP VoteCast.The question is whether that has changed, as Jews now see Israel's survival in a new light as its war with Hamas widens to Hezbollah and possibly Iran.That has put a new focus on the relationship between Israel and the U.S., which continues to provide military aid. And many Jews say rising acts of antisemitism in the United States and anti-Israel protests sweeping across cities and college campuses -- including in Philadelphia -- have made them feel unsafe.In Pennsylvania, still fresh in many minds is a gunman absorbed by white supremacist ideology murdering 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018, the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.As Pennsylvania plays a central role in the election, many say they've never seen such outreach from campaigns as they have now.From Trump on down, Republicans are attempting to win over Jewish voters by highlighting a Democratic Party torn between its traditional and unconditional support for Israel and a growing faction that has accused Israel of war crimes in Gaza, called for Israel to unconditionally stop attacking Hamas, and demanded that the U.S. end its military support for Israel.For some Jews who typically vote Democratic, that has resonated.\"I think that there are folks who are reluctant Trump voters who feel scared as Jews in this country,\" said Jeremy Kazzaz, a Pittsburgh resident and Harris supporter.Kazzaz, however, said Harris has a long record of fighting antisemitism that is relatively unknown to many voters.He pointed out that the Biden administration tapped her husband, Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, to lead a task force to develop a strategy to fight antisemitism well before Hamas attacked Israel. Emhoff has been a key surrogate, campaigning in front of Jewish audiences in the Philadelphia suburbs and speaking at the groundbreaking of a new complex replacing Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue.Still, where Harris' supporters see strong support of Israel -- for instance, the Biden administration sent a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery to Israel, along with the troops needed to operate it -- others see conditional support.That includes Biden urging Israel not to hit Iran's nuclear program or oil fields. At the same time, Biden has stressed his administration's support for Israel and, in her remarks on the anniversary of Hamas' attack, Harris said she'll \"always ensure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself and that I will always work to ensure the safety and security of the Jewish people here and around the world.\"Steve Rosenberg, of Philadelphia, who voted for Trump in 2016 and then Biden in 2020, will vote for Trump in 2024. In large part, Rosenberg sees Biden's lifting of Trump-era sanctions on Iran as providing the cash for the Islamic Republic to finance a war against Israel. Trump imposed the sanctions after voiding a treaty the Obama administration had reached to slow Iran's progress toward nuclear weapons, which he called a bad deal.\"The question is, 'Who is better off today than four years ago?'\" Rosenberg said. \"And the answer is Iran and the mullahs and their proxies, and it's because Biden and Kamala Harris have capitulated to Iran.\"Kaufman, a self-described progressive who lives in Pittsburgh's heavily Jewish Squirrel Hill neighborhood, never thought she would vote for Trump.But now, she expects Trump will continue a hardline stance against Iran -- which she calls an imminent threat to democracy, human rights and western civilization -- and worries that Harris will appease Iran and pander to the party's left wing.Jews with very strong connections to Israel -- her parents were born there and her daughter just finished a two-year eight-month mandatory service with the Israeli army -- are similarly conflicted over supporting Harris, Kaufman said. \"I'm saying it out loud everywhere, but most people aren't saying it out loud.\"Many Jews who support Harris, however, say they see Trump as a threat to democracy.That's important, they say, because minorities -- including Jews -- have reason to fear persecution under dictators.They can unfurl a list of comments by Trump that they see as threatening: using the military against domestic enemies, peddling dual-loyalty tropes about Jews, setting up Jews as scapegoats if he loses and, in the days after Hamas' attack, criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while praising Hezbollah as \"very smart.\"Emhoff called Trump a \"known antisemite.\"Some see Trump's efforts on Jan. 6, 2021, to stay in power as a threat. Many are wary of his affinity for dictators, and bring up his dinner at his Mar-a-Lago resort with far-right activist Nick Fuentes and rapper Ye, two men known for spewing antisemitic rhetoric.\"That's the conversation that I'm having with Jews,\" said Rabbi Beth Janus of Philadelphia.Janus said Jews she knows are excited that a woman could be president and that she's married to a Jewish man. Conversely, Trump's support for Israel is transactional, she said.\"When it serves his needs, his objectives, he supports Israel,\" Janus said. \"But if it didn't, then he wouldn't support Israel.\"___Follow Marc Levy at twitter.com/timelywriter.",

HBT (the \"Company\" or \"HBT Financial\" or \"HBT\"), the holding company for Heartland Bank and Trust Company, today reported net income of $18.2 million, or $0.57 diluted earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2024. This compares to net income of $18.1 million, or $0.57 diluted earnings per share, for the second quarter of 2024, and net income of $19.7 million, or $0.62 diluted earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2023.J. Lance Carter, President and Chief Executive Officer of HBT Financial, said, \"In the third quarter, we continued our consistently solid financial performance with net income of $18.2 million, adjusted net income(1) of $19.2 million, adjusted ROAA(1) of 1.53% and adjusted ROATCE(1) of 17.20%. We have also seen tangible equity continue to build, with tangible book value per share increasing 23.3% over the last year. Our net interest margin (tax-equivalent basis)(1) increased 3 basis points to 4.03% while funding costs remained modest, increasing 5 basis points to 1.47%. Our asset quality remains strong with net charge-offs at 0.07% of average loans on an annualized basis during the quarter and nonperforming assets to total assets at 0.17%. We have not seen any significant signs of stress in our loan portfolio, but we continue to monitor the portfolio closely. Noninterest income remained consistent and noninterest expense of $31.3 million was up only 2.1% when compared to the third quarter of 2023, as we remain focused on operational efficiency while continuing to invest in our business. Lastly, all capital ratios had solid increases and can support future organic growth or acquisitions.\"____________________________________(1) See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most closely comparable GAAP financial measures.Adjusted Net IncomeIn addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company believes non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, which adjust for acquisition expenses, branch closure expenses, gains (losses) on closed branch premises, net earnings (losses) from closed or sold operations, charges related to termination of certain employee benefit plans, realized gains (losses) on sales of securities, and mortgage servicing rights fair value adjustments, provide investors with additional insight into its operational performance. The Company reported adjusted net income of $19.2 million, or $0.61 adjusted diluted earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2024. This compares to adjusted net income of $18.1 million, or $0.57 adjusted diluted earnings per share, for the second quarter of 2024, and adjusted net income of $20.3 million, or $0.63 adjusted diluted earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2023 (see \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" tables below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most closely comparable GAAP financial measures).Net Interest Income and Net Interest MarginNet interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $47.7 million, an increase of 1.5% from $47.0 million for the second quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to improved loan yields which were mostly offset by an increase in funding costs.Relative to the third quarter of 2023, net interest income decreased 1.1% from $48.3 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher funding costs which were partially offset by higher asset yields and an increase in interest-earning assets.Net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 3.98%, compared to 3.95% for the second quarter of 2024, and net interest margin (tax-equivalent basis)(1) for the third quarter of 2024 was 4.03%, compared to 4.00% for the second quarter of 2024. Higher yields on interest-earning assets, which increased by 7 basis points to 5.35%, were mostly offset by an increase in funding costs, with the cost of funds increasing by 5 basis points to 1.47%.Relative to the third quarter of 2023, net interest margin decreased 9 basis points from 4.07% and net interest margin (tax-equivalent basis)(1) decreased 10 basis points from 4.13%. These decreases were primarily attributable to increases in funding costs outpacing increases in interest-earning asset yields.____________________________________(1) See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most closely comparable GAAP financial measures.Noninterest IncomeNoninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $8.7 million, a decrease from $9.6 million for the second quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to changes in the mortgage servicing rights (\"MSR\") fair value adjustment, with a $1.5 million negative MSR fair value adjustment included in the third quarter 2024 results compared to a $0.1 million negative MSR fair value adjustment included in the second quarter 2024 results. Partially offsetting the MSR fair value adjustment was a $0.2 million increase in service charge income and a $0.2 million increase in other noninterest income, primarily attributable to swap fee income.Relative to the third quarter of 2023, noninterest income decreased 8.3% from $9.5 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to the $1.5 million negative MSR fair value adjustment included in the third quarter 2024 results, partially offset by the absence of $0.8 million in realized losses on the sale of securities included in the third quarter 2023 results.Noninterest ExpenseNoninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $31.3 million, a 2.7% increase from $30.5 million for the second quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to a $0.5 million increase in occupancy expense, driven in part by a seasonal increase in planned building maintenance expenses, and a $0.4 million increase in marketing and customer relations expense.Relative to the third quarter of 2023, noninterest expense increased 2.1% from $30.7 million. The increase was primarily attributable to a $0.7 million increase in salaries and a $0.4 million increase in employee benefits. Partially offsetting these increases was a $0.3 million decrease in marketing and customer relations expense.On February 1, 2023, HBT Financial completed its acquisition of Town and Country Financial Corporation (\"Town and Country\") with the core system conversion successfully completed in April 2023. Acquisition-related expenses recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 are summarized below. No Town and Country acquisition-related expenses were recognized subsequent to the second quarter of 2023.(dollars in thousands) Nine Months EndedSeptember 30, 2023 PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES $5,924 NONINTEREST EXPENSE Salaries 3,584 Furniture and equipment 39 Data processing 2,031 Marketing and customer relations 24 Loan collection and servicing 125 Legal fees and other noninterest expense 1,964 Total noninterest expense 7,767 Total acquisition-related expenses $13,691Loan PortfolioTotal loans outstanding, before allowance for credit losses, were $3.37 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with $3.39 billion at June 30, 2024, and $3.34 billion at September 30, 2023. The $15.7 million decrease from June 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to several larger commercial real estate loan payoffs due to the sale of the property and a couple of larger one-to-four family residential loan payoffs. These decreases were partially offset by increased line usage and term originations in our agricultural and farmland portfolio.DepositsTotal deposits were $4.28 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with $4.32 billion at June 30, 2024, and $4.20 billion at September 30, 2023. The $38.0 million decrease from June 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to lower balances maintained in retail accounts and a $18.3 million decrease in escrow balances related to seasonal tax payments, partially offset by increases in public funds and business accounts. Additionally, we continue to see a shift towards higher cost deposit products, with decreases in noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing demand, and savings balances being partially offset by an increase in money market and time deposit balances.Asset QualityNonperforming loans totaled $8.2 million, or 0.24% of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared with $8.4 million, or 0.25% of total loans, at June 30, 2024, and $6.7 million, or 0.20% of total loans, at September 30, 2023. Additionally, of the $8.2 million of nonperforming loans held as of September 30, 2024, $2.0 million is either wholly or partially guaranteed by the U.S. government. The $0.2 million decrease in nonperforming loans from June 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to the payoff of $0.1 million in nonaccrual agricultural and farmland loans.The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $0.6 million for the third quarter of 2024. The provision for credit losses primarily reflects a $1.2 million increase in required reserves resulting from changes in economic forecasts; a $0.2 million increase in required reserves resulting from qualitative factor changes; a $0.6 million decrease in required reserves driven by decreased loan balances and changes within the loan portfolio; and a $0.2 million decrease in specific reserves.The Company had net charge-offs of $0.6 million, or 0.07% of average loans on an annualized basis, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to net charge-offs of $0.7 million, or 0.08% of average loans on an annualized basis, for the second quarter of 2024, and net recoveries of $0.1 million, or 0.01% of average loans on an annualized basis, for the third quarter of 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, net charge-offs were primarily recognized in the commercial and industrial category which had $0.7 million of net charge-offs.The Company's allowance for credit losses was 1.22% of total loans and 499% of nonperforming loans at September 30, 2024, compared with 1.21% of total loans and 484% of nonperforming loans at June 30, 2024. In addition, the allowance for credit losses on unfunded lending-related commitments totaled $4.1 million as of September 30, 2024, compared with $4.3 million as of June 30, 2024.CapitalAs of September 30, 2024, the Company exceeded all regulatory capital requirements under Basel III as summarized in the following table:September 30, 2024 For CapitalAdequacy PurposesWith CapitalConservation Buffer Total capital to risk-weighted assets 16.54% 10.50%Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 14.48 8.50 Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 13.15 7.00 Tier 1 leverage ratio 11.16 4.00The ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets(1) increased to 9.35% as of September 30, 2024, from 8.74% as of June 30, 2024, and tangible book value per share(1) increased by $0.91 to $14.55 as of September 30, 2024, when compared to June 30, 2024.During the third quarter of 2024, the Company did not repurchase shares of its common stock under its stock repurchase program. The Company's Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $15 million of HBT Financial common stock under its stock repurchase program, which is in effect until January 1, 2025.

    "content": "Four years of Donald Trump's false claims about a stolen 2020 election have kindled growing suspicion of voting machines among conspiracy theorists. One of their solutions is to replace the tabulators that count every vote with people who will do that by hand.Four years of Donald Trump's false claims about a stolen 2020 election have kindled growing suspicion of voting machines among conspiracy theorists. One of their solutions is to replace the tabulators that count every vote with people who will do that by hand.Controversies over the issue have flared periodically in pockets of the country before the 2024 presidential election even though research has shown that hand-counting is more prone to error, costlier and likely to delay results.The few counties that have attempted the massive task have found the process more time-consuming, expensive and inaccurate than expected.In Texas' Gillespie County, a hand-count of Republican primary election ballots this year stretched into the early morning hours, taking almost 24 consecutive hours with 200 people counting ballots, the Texas Tribune and VoteBeat reported. The hand-count cost taxpayers about double the wage costs of the 2020 Republican primary and involved fixing a series of errors, the news nonprofits reported.People are also reading...

After the first day of counting, the county clerk, Mark Kampf, estimated a discrepancy of nearly 25% between the hand and machine count, attributing it to human counting error. The painstakingly slow process was halted by the state's Supreme Court over concerns that early vote tallies could be leaked publicly.Shasta County, a conservative rural county in northern California, last year abandoned plans to hand-count ballots after the plan was estimated to cost $1.6 million and require more than 1,200 additional employees.Still, some jurisdictions continue to call for hand-counting.Most recently, Georgia's State Election Board voted to require poll workers to count the number of paper ballots, but not the votes, by hand after voting is completed. But the rule was blocked Oct. 15 by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney.A 'grassroots' movementSome Republicans, inspired by election lies claiming that widespread fraud cost Trump reelection in 2020, have pushed for hand-counting ballots and banning the electronic tabulators used to scan ballots and record votes, despite no evidence of widespread fraud or major irregularities.\"This movement could have died if it had just been a flash in the pan from the 2020 election,\" said Charles Stewart, a political science professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But conspiracy theorists such as election denier and MyPillow founder Mike Lindell have traveled the country working \"to create a grassroots social movement around this skepticism,\" Stewart said.While these conspiracy theories are not common nationwide, they have found a stubborn hold in pockets of the country, \"primarily in the deepest red parts of the deepest red states,\" Stewart said.Problems with cost, speed and accuracyThe hand-counting of ballots threatens to delay results by days, weeks or even months, depending on jurisdiction and staffing. Swapping machines with hand-counts would not only be slower but also increase the chances for mistakes and fraud, research has shown.In a New Hampshire study, poll workers who counted ballots by hand were off by 8%, compared with a 0.5% error rate for machine counting.\"Human beings are really bad at tedious things, and counting ballots is among the most tedious things we could do,\" Stewart said. \"Computers are very good at tedious things. They can count very quickly and very accurately.\"Paper ballots already usedTrump and other Republicans have called for the use of paper ballots in this year's election. In fact, paper ballots or paper records of every vote already are produced in nearly every state.The Brennan Center at New York University estimates that 98% of all votes nationwide will be cast on paper in this year's presidential election.Paper ballots also are used in postelection, hand-count audits to identify any irregularities with ballot scanning and counting and to ensure the machine results are accurate. Election officials also conduct accuracy testing on the machines before every election.Susannah Goodman, director of election security at Common Cause, said informing voters of the checks already in place can help reduce the fear and distrust at the center of calls for hand-counting ballots.\"If you show voters the process and all of the steps that are taken to ensure the outcome is correct -- not just tell, show -- they gain confidence,\" she said.Elections Voting systems are easy to blame, but are hard to hack and tested for accuracy CHRISTINA A.

    "content": "Jakarta (ANTARA) - President Prabowo Subianto, at the Merdeka Palace on Sunday (October 20), announced seven coordinating ministers, 41 ministers, and five ministerial-level officials in the Red and White Cabinet.Five women occupy ministerial positions, which brings new hope for women's representation as policy stakeholders in the country.Earlier, there were nine women ministers during the Joko Widodo (Jokowi) administration. Jokowi's cabinet is recorded to have the most women ministers compared to other Indonesian presidents' cabinets.During the era of the first president, Soekarno, there were two women ministers, while in Soeharto's era, there were nine women ministers, though there were only two in the government transition era under the third president B.J. Habibie's leadership.There were two female ministers in the 4th President Abdurrahman Wahid's cabinet and two in the Indonesian 5th President and first female President Megawati Soekarnoputri's cabinet.During the 6th President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's (SBY's) era, there were eight women ministers.Here are the names and brief profiles of the five women ministers in Prabowo's Red and White Cabinet:1.

(NASDAQ: HBT) (the \"Company\" or \"HBT Financial\" or \"HBT\"), the holding company for Heartland Bank and Trust Company, today reported net income of $18.2 million, or $0.57 diluted earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2024. This compares to net income of $18.1 million, or $0.57 diluted earnings per share, for the second quarter of 2024, and net income of $19.7 million, or $0.62 diluted earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2023.J. Lance Carter, President and Chief Executive Officer of HBT Financial, said, \"In the third quarter, we continued our consistently solid financial performance with net income of $18.2 million, adjusted net income(1) of $19.2 million, adjusted ROAA(1) of 1.53% and adjusted ROATCE(1) of 17.20%. We have also seen tangible equity continue to build, with tangible book value per share increasing 23.3% over the last year. Our net interest margin (tax-equivalent basis)(1) increased 3 basis points to 4.03% while funding costs remained modest, increasing 5 basis points to 1.47%. Our asset quality remains strong with net charge-offs at 0.07% of average loans on an annualized basis during the quarter and nonperforming assets to total assets at 0.17%. We have not seen any significant signs of stress in our loan portfolio, but we continue to monitor the portfolio closely. Noninterest income remained consistent and noninterest expense of $31.3 million was up only 2.1% when compared to the third quarter of 2023, as we remain focused on operational efficiency while continuing to invest in our business. Lastly, all capital ratios had solid increases and can support future organic growth or acquisitions.\"____________________________________(1) See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most closely comparable GAAP financial measures.Adjusted Net IncomeIn addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company believes non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, which adjust for acquisition expenses, branch closure expenses, gains (losses) on closed branch premises, net earnings (losses) from closed or sold operations, charges related to termination of certain employee benefit plans, realized gains (losses) on sales of securities, and mortgage servicing rights fair value adjustments, provide investors with additional insight into its operational performance. The Company reported adjusted net income of $19.2 million, or $0.61 adjusted diluted earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2024. This compares to adjusted net income of $18.1 million, or $0.57 adjusted diluted earnings per share, for the second quarter of 2024, and adjusted net income of $20.3 million, or $0.63 adjusted diluted earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2023 (see \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" tables below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most closely comparable GAAP financial measures).Net Interest Income and Net Interest MarginNet interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $47.7 million, an increase of 1.5% from $47.0 million for the second quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to improved loan yields which were mostly offset by an increase in funding costs.Relative to the third quarter of 2023, net interest income decreased 1.1% from $48.3 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher funding costs which were partially offset by higher asset yields and an increase in interest-earning assets.Net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 3.98%, compared to 3.95% for the second quarter of 2024, and net interest margin (tax-equivalent basis)(1) for the third quarter of 2024 was 4.03%, compared to 4.00% for the second quarter of 2024. Higher yields on interest-earning assets, which increased by 7 basis points to 5.35%, were mostly offset by an increase in funding costs, with the cost of funds increasing by 5 basis points to 1.47%.Relative to the third quarter of 2023, net interest margin decreased 9 basis points from 4.07% and net interest margin (tax-equivalent basis)(1) decreased 10 basis points from 4.13%. These decreases were primarily attributable to increases in funding costs outpacing increases in interest-earning asset yields.____________________________________(1) See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most closely comparable GAAP financial measures.Noninterest IncomeNoninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $8.7 million, a decrease from $9.6 million for the second quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to changes in the mortgage servicing rights (\"MSR\") fair value adjustment, with a $1.5 million negative MSR fair value adjustment included in the third quarter 2024 results compared to a $0.1 million negative MSR fair value adjustment included in the second quarter 2024 results. Partially offsetting the MSR fair value adjustment was a $0.2 million increase in service charge income and a $0.2 million increase in other noninterest income, primarily attributable to swap fee income.Relative to the third quarter of 2023, noninterest income decreased 8.3% from $9.5 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to the $1.5 million negative MSR fair value adjustment included in the third quarter 2024 results, partially offset by the absence of $0.8 million in realized losses on the sale of securities included in the third quarter 2023 results.Noninterest ExpenseNoninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $31.3 million, a 2.7% increase from $30.5 million for the second quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to a $0.5 million increase in occupancy expense, driven in part by a seasonal increase in planned building maintenance expenses, and a $0.4 million increase in marketing and customer relations expense.Relative to the third quarter of 2023, noninterest expense increased 2.1% from $30.7 million. The increase was primarily attributable to a $0.7 million increase in salaries and a $0.4 million increase in employee benefits. Partially offsetting these increases was a $0.3 million decrease in marketing and customer relations expense.On February 1, 2023, HBT Financial completed its acquisition of Town and Country Financial Corporation (\"Town and Country\") with the core system conversion successfully completed in April 2023. Acquisition-related expenses recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 are summarized below. No Town and Country acquisition-related expenses were recognized subsequent to the second quarter of 2023.(dollars in thousands) Nine Months EndedSeptember 30, 2023 PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES $5,924 NONINTEREST EXPENSE Salaries 3,584 Furniture and equipment 39 Data processing 2,031 Marketing and customer relations 24 Loan collection and servicing 125 Legal fees and other noninterest expense 1,964 Total noninterest expense 7,767 Total acquisition-related expenses $13,691Loan PortfolioTotal loans outstanding, before allowance for credit losses, were $3.37 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with $3.39 billion at June 30, 2024, and $3.34 billion at September 30, 2023. The $15.7 million decrease from June 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to several larger commercial real estate loan payoffs due to the sale of the property and a couple of larger one-to-four family residential loan payoffs. These decreases were partially offset by increased line usage and term originations in our agricultural and farmland portfolio.DepositsTotal deposits were $4.28 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with $4.32 billion at June 30, 2024, and $4.20 billion at September 30, 2023. The $38.0 million decrease from June 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to lower balances maintained in retail accounts and a $18.3 million decrease in escrow balances related to seasonal tax payments, partially offset by increases in public funds and business accounts. Additionally, we continue to see a shift towards higher cost deposit products, with decreases in noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing demand, and savings balances being partially offset by an increase in money market and time deposit balances.Asset QualityNonperforming loans totaled $8.2 million, or 0.24% of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared with $8.4 million, or 0.25% of total loans, at June 30, 2024, and $6.7 million, or 0.20% of total loans, at September 30, 2023. Additionally, of the $8.2 million of nonperforming loans held as of September 30, 2024, $2.0 million is either wholly or partially guaranteed by the U.S. government. The $0.2 million decrease in nonperforming loans from June 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to the payoff of $0.1 million in nonaccrual agricultural and farmland loans.The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $0.6 million for the third quarter of 2024. The provision for credit losses primarily reflects a $1.2 million increase in required reserves resulting from changes in economic forecasts; a $0.2 million increase in required reserves resulting from qualitative factor changes; a $0.6 million decrease in required reserves driven by decreased loan balances and changes within the loan portfolio; and a $0.2 million decrease in specific reserves.The Company had net charge-offs of $0.6 million, or 0.07% of average loans on an annualized basis, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to net charge-offs of $0.7 million, or 0.08% of average loans on an annualized basis, for the second quarter of 2024, and net recoveries of $0.1 million, or 0.01% of average loans on an annualized basis, for the third quarter of 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, net charge-offs were primarily recognized in the commercial and industrial category which had $0.7 million of net charge-offs.The Company's allowance for credit losses was 1.22% of total loans and 499% of nonperforming loans at September 30, 2024, compared with 1.21% of total loans and 484% of nonperforming loans at June 30, 2024. In addition, the allowance for credit losses on unfunded lending-related commitments totaled $4.1 million as of September 30, 2024, compared with $4.3 million as of June 30, 2024.CapitalAs of September 30, 2024, the Company exceeded all regulatory capital requirements under Basel III as summarized in the following table:September 30, 2024 For CapitalAdequacy PurposesWith CapitalConservation Buffer Total capital to risk-weighted assets 16.54% 10.50%Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 14.48 8.50 Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 13.15 7.00 Tier 1 leverage ratio 11.16 4.00The ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets(1) increased to 9.35% as of September 30, 2024, from 8.74% as of June 30, 2024, and tangible book value per share(1) increased by $0.91 to $14.55 as of September 30, 2024, when compared to June 30, 2024.During the third quarter of 2024, the Company did not repurchase shares of its common stock under its stock repurchase program.

    "content": "The High Court is set to deliver its judgment on Monday, October 21, 2024 in a case filed by Bernard Mornah, the flagbearer of the People's National Convention (PNC), who is challenging his disqualification from the 2024 presidential election by the Electoral Commission (EC).Mornah was among 11 candidates disqualified by the EC on September 20, 2024, due to unresolved errors in their nomination forms.He, along with two others, filed a suit against the EC, arguing that the commission violated constitutional provisions by not allowing him the opportunity to rectify the errors before disqualifying him.Mornah contends that the EC's actions were unfair and unconstitutional. According to him, the EC failed to communicate the issues in the nomination forms, especially those flagged as potentially criminal, leaving candidates without the chance to address them.Ahead of the court ruling, Mornah shared his optimism in an interview with Citi News, expressing confidence that the judgment would be in his favour.\"It is not going to be anything dramatic. We expect that the court will do what is right by ensuring that the Electoral Commission is directed to admit me onto the 2024 ballot and then we can roll out our campaign in full as you are aware, the printing of material and other things are stalled.\"You know that I am the people's president. So I am in high spirits and we are hopeful that judgement will be done as we committed no crime as to take us out of the ballot.\"",

    "title": "New cases of political violence roil US ahead of contentious election",
    "content": "At least 300 cases of political violence have been identified by Reuters since Trump's supporters stormed the US Capitol on Jan 6, 2021, including at least 51 incidents this year. With just two weeks to go before the Nov. 5 presidential election, the cases are part of the biggest and most sustained increase in U.S. political violence since the 1970s. In York, Pennsylvania, a man accosted a group of people rallying for Vice President Kamala Harris' White House campaign, punching a 74-year-old man in the head and calling another man a \"n- supporter\" as he fled.In northern Michigan, an assailant enraged by his hatred of Donald Trump used an all-terrain vehicle to run over and injure an 81-year-old man who was putting up a yard sign for the former president's reelection bid.The recent attacks were among at least 300 cases of political violence identified by Reuters since Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, including at least 51 incidents this year. With just two weeks to go before the Nov. 5 presidential election, the cases are part of the biggest and most sustained increase in U.S. political violence since the 1970s.Some of the violence has been reported widely, most notably two assassination attempts on Trump, a Republican. Other high-profile incidents include three shootings in recent weeks at a Democratic campaign office for Harris in Arizona.But Reuters documented scores of other cases on contentious political issues - from election disputes to LGBTQ+ rights and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Incidents ranged from small fights over political signs to more violent brawls and property destruction at rallies. Most of this year's violence wasn't fatal with the exception of two deaths: a spectator killed during July's attempt on Trump's life and the shooter.The pace of cases has remained remarkably consistent since beginning to rise in 2016, around the time of Trump's first presidential run. In 2021, which included the tumult that followed Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election, there were 93 cases of political violence, followed by 79 in 2022, and 76 in 2023..Political extremism experts warn that the charged atmosphere around the 2024 presidential election has created a highly volatile situation. Trump in particular often uses incendiary rhetoric, threatening to put his political enemies on trial and to deploy the military against the \"radical left\", calling them \"the enemy within.\"Americans are starting to see violence as \"part of the way politics happens,\" said Nealin Parker, who heads Common Ground USA, a nonprofit that studies ways to bridge America's political and cultural divides. In the current climate of mistrust, she added, \"incidents of violence can metastasize into something bigger.\"Robert Pape, a University of Chicago professor who studies political violence, expressed concern over the prospect of post-election violence in battleground states, where the margin of victory could be a few thousand votes. He likened it to \"a wildfire season\" with lots of \"dry combustible material\" and the \"potential for lightning strikes.\"Trump himself has declined to rule out the possibility of violence if he loses in November. When asked by Time magazine in April if he expected violence after the election, he said, \"If we don't win, you know, it depends.\"He has told supporters that any loss in this year's race would be due to fraud.The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment. The Trump campaign, when asked about the steady rise of political violence and the recent attacks against Harris and Trump supporters, provided a statement attacking Harris on immigration and criminal justice reform.The highest-profile case of recent political violence was the first assassination attempt on Trump at a July 13 campaign rally in Pennsylvania. The shooter, Thomas Crooks, was killed at the scene. He had no \"definitive ideology,\" federal investigators concluded.Law enforcement agencies were put on alert for potential retaliatory violence by Trump supporters. There were some concerning incidents, including a man in Florida who told his wife he was \"preparing for war\" after the shooting and left home with multiple guns, according to police reports. He was found burying a full ammunition box in a public park. Police seized seven rifles and handguns, and had the man hospitalized for a mental health evaluation.But the anger wasn't confined to Trump's supporters.\nKemppainen, 22 and unemployed, went on a vandalism spree eight days later in his town of Hancock, population 4,500, which mostly backed Trump in the 2020 election.On July 21, when President Joe Biden quit the presidential race and endorsed Harris, Kemppainen rode an all-terrain vehicle through the streets and targeted Trump supporters, said Hancock Police Department chief Tami Sleeman in an interview.Reuters pieced together what happened from police reports obtained in a records request, copies of chat messages provided by Kemppainen's associates and police, and a video Kemppainen posted on Discord.He vandalized a pickup truck with a Trump sticker, deflating its tires, tearing off a side mirror and smashing its windows. He also damaged a truck with a pro-police decal. He posted a video of one attack on Discord with the comment \"doing my part.\" Then he tore up Trump yard signs and threw them into the street.When an onlooker, Carl Nelson, 81, replanted the signs, Kemppainen ran him over with the ATV and fled, hospitalizing the Vietnam veteran.The next day, Kemppainen rang Hancock Police: \"I am calling to confess to a crime,\" he said in a message describing his rampage, according to a recording police shared with Reuters. \"So if you could send someone to pick me up. I appreciate it.\"When police heard the voicemail two hours later, they worried the caller sounded unbalanced and dispatched six officers, said Sleeman, the chief. By the time they arrived, Kemppainen had fatally shot himself with an assault rifle, a police report said. His father said Kemppainen was on anti-depression medication and also had an autism diagnosis, the report added. In an interview, a family member confirmed that Kemppainen struggled with mental health issues.Nelson, who Kemppainen attacked, told Reuters he spent several days in the hospital for knee and upper body injuries. \"This was such a peaceful area,\" said Nelson. He has decided to vote for Trump, he added.On Sept. 15, a second assassination attempt on Trump refocused attention on the risk of political violence in this year's election. Suspect Ryan Routh had waited for hours with an assault rifle by Trump's golf course in West Palm Beach when an agent spotted him in shrubbery and fired. Routh fled and was apprehended quickly.Eleven days later, in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, Alan Vandersloot, a 74-year-old local borough councilman, stood with a Harris sign among about a dozen of her supporters at a rally in York, a city of nearly 45,000 in a county that broadly backed Trump in 2020.As the rally was ending, Vandersloot told Reuters, a man grabbed him from behind and slammed him to the pavement, opening a two-inch gash on his forehead. The attacker, Robert Trotta, punched Vandersloot repeatedly before fleeing, two witnesses said in interviews.When another rallygoer, Dan Almoney, gave chase, Trotta called him \"a n-- supporter,\" Almoney said. Almoney interpreted the slur as a reference to Harris and her backers, he said. Trotta, Vandersloot and Almoney are white.Trotta, unable to post bail, has yet to make a plea on assault and harassment charges, court records show. His lawyer declined to comment. Trotta is a registered Republican, according to state records. His social media posts, from an account last active in 2020, supported Trump and criticized Democrats.A York City Police Department spokesperson, Captain Daniel Lentz, said he didn't believe Trotta's attack was \"politically motivated\" because Trotta previously pleaded guilty to two cases of harassment in which he struck random people. The police report, however, did not include statements from Vandersloot and Almoney, who both said they believed the attack was political. Lentz said he didn't know why the police didn't record their accounts.There's no government data on political violence, though several universities and private research groups track it in various ways, typically using databases built on news accounts. Some include random hate crimes; others, including Reuters, do not.Most have not released comprehensive data since 2020.The 300 cases identified by Reuters were culled from records on thousands of violent crimes since the 2021 Capitol attack. Most of that data was captured initially by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, a global violence-tracking project run by a nonpartisan research group in Wisconsin. Reporters identified additional cases using news databases, court filings and police reports obtained through public records requests.Some of the cases don't break down along traditional partisan lines, including those linked to disputes over the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.That was the case last month when Caleb Gannon, a pro-Palestinian critic of U.S. government support for Israel, began heckling a pro-Israel rally in Newton, Massachusetts. Cell phone video shows Gannon shouting, \"You're supporting genocide!\" before running into the crowd and tackling Scott Hayes, a fervent backer of Israel.Earlier this year, Hayes, an Iraq War veteran, posted a photo on social media of a handgun with a Star of David pendant and the message \"Hey Jew Haters. Bring it.\" As they wrestled on the ground, Hayes shot Gannon in the abdomen.Hayes, 47, is awaiting trial after pleading not guilty to assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. The county prosecutor has said an assault and battery charge also will be pursued against Gannon, 31, who remains hospitalized. Hayes' lawyer said he will argue self-defense but declined further comment.Other cases are directly linked to the election.On Sept. 26, a Michigan man was arrested for assaulting a U.S. Postal Service worker who delivered a Harris campaign mailer to his house. The postal worker was in her truck when Russell Valleau, 61, approached on a bike, yelling that he \"did not want that 'Black bitch' in his mailbox,\" according to police records and a statement from the Oakland County prosecutor.When the postal worker, who is Black, told Valleau to back away, he called her a \"Black bitch\" and lunged at her with a knife, according to her account to the Farmington Hills Police Department. She sprayed him with dog repellent, and he retreated. \"I just had a man come to me with a knife and try to stab me,\" she said moments later in a call to police, according to a recording obtained through a records request. \"I sprayed him.\"Police reported finding Valleau lying in a nearby yard, apparently intoxicated and suffering the effects of chemical repellant. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of assault and battery and ethnic intimidation. His lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.In another case this summer, four white men in a pick-up truck rolled up to a rural home in coastal North Carolina and asked three Black teens in the yard \"if they liked Donald Trump,\" according to a report from the Pasquotank County Sheriff's Office. When the youths said, \"No,\" the report said, the men opened fired with a BB gun, hitting one youth in the leg and another in the buttocks. The shots also broke windows on the house, a shed and a car out front.The truck drove off. Police are investigating the case as an assault with a deadly weapon and have no suspects. The children suffered minor injuries and declined medical treatment.Christian Gilyard, the youths' father, said political tensions have become more pronounced since the contested 2020 election, but he never expected problems in his own neighborhood. \"It's shocking,\" he said, \"that something like this would happen here.\"",

    "title": "The Quadrennial Question: Can We Trust the Polls and Pundits? - Liberty Nation News",
    "content": "You will remember that in 2016, almost every prediction by the pundits, backed up by almost every reputable poll, had Hillary Clinton defeating Donald Trump with ease. And in 2020, most forecasters predicted that Trump would suffer a massive defeat at the hands of Joe Biden. Of course, Trump triumphed in '16 and in '20 came within 50,000 votes in three states of winning a second term. Thus, we can reasonably conclude that election polls and predictions should be taken with a grain of salt.In fairness to the polling organizations, support for Trump is undoubtedly the most difficult to quantify because of the so-called \"hidden Trump voters\" who are either hard to reach, reluctant to admit their preference for fear of being ostracized, or are loathe to participate in any survey conducted by big corporate, i.e. anti-Trump, media. But off-target forecasts have a long history dating back to 1948, when 50 out of 50 journalists covering the race between Thomas Dewey and incumbent Harry Truman predicted an easy Dewey victory, to the point that many of them stopped covering the campaign in its final weeks. Truman famously shocked everyone with a decisive win.After such a major misfire, the issue of how accurate, predictive, and trustworthy polls and pundit predictions actually are has become a quadrennial question. Every four years, partisans on both sides are prone to either celebrate or dismiss the latest surveys while clinging to the rosy predictions of their preferred authors and commentators. And there have been plenty of predictions from both conservatives and liberals in every presidential election this century that turned out to be premature and/or downright embarrassing.In September of 2000, left-wing Slate proclaimed that George W. Bush was \"toast\" after he was overtaken in the polls by Al Gore: \"Now that he has passed Bush, the race is over.\" In 2004, acclaimed pollster John Zogby predicted on Election Day that John Kerry would score a comfortable victory over Bush with 311 electoral votes. Kerry turned out to be the only Democrat so far in the 21st century to lose both the popular vote and the Electoral College. In 2008, while estimates of Barack Obama's general election victory were mostly accurate, Zogby was embarrassed again in the critical New Hampshire Democratic Party primary, predicting that Obama would prevail over Mrs. Clinton by 13 points. He lost by almost three points. As The Hill put it in a comprehensive piece on blown predictions, it seemed to signal that the primary misfire that year was caused by \"completing surveys too soon to detect late-campaign shifts in voters' preferences.\"In 2016, almost every model for the race had Mrs. Clinton on a glide path to victory. She was given more than a 90% chance of winning by the likes of the Princeton Election Consortium and, most famously, by left-wing election \"guru\" Nate Silver. And we all know how wrong they were. In 2020, dubbed by The Hill as \"polling's worst overall performance in 40 years,\" the most famous among the many overheated predictions of a Biden landslide was on CNN, which reported in October that Joe Biden had opened up a lead of 16 points over Trump, and later that month, forecast a 12-point margin. Trump lost by just over four points.Polling is both an art and an inexact science. Several determinative factors are almost impossible to predict: voter turnout (massive in 2020); undecided voters breaking heavily in one direction at the 11th hour; last-minute changes of heart in the voting booth or events in the waning days of a campaign that the polls are unable to incorporate into their surveys and analysis. Such was the case in 1980 when a race widely considered a toss-up as late as October turned into an overwhelming victory for Ronald Reagan after his single debate with incumbent Jimmy Carter just days before the election.Liberty Nation News has written at length about the 2024 presidential election, reporting regularly (and now daily) on everything from whether the neck-and-neck nature of Trump vs Harris polling is actually predictive to the possibility of a landslide. Given their built-in advantage in the Electoral College, Republicans are unconcerned with, and all but expect to lose, the popular vote. It is the new paradigm of the Trump years - huge deep-blue states, California and New York, running up the score in the popular vote by rejecting Trump in massive numbers, smaller red states embracing him, and medium-sized states with lighter shades of blue and red determining the outcome.Like every election other than foreseeable landslide victories by Richard Nixon in 1972, Reagan in 1984, and arguably Obama in 2008, predictions based on vibes, lawn signs, the opinions of respected analysts, or even extensive polling, are all fraught with peril. What will be the outcome this year once all the votes are tabulated? Don't count on pollsters and pundits to provide the answer.",

    "title": "HBT Financial, Inc. Announces Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results",
    "content": "J. Lance Carter, President and Chief Executive Officer of HBT Financial, said, \"In the third quarter, we continued our consistently solid financial performance with net income of $18.2 million, adjusted net income(1) of $19.2 million, adjusted ROAA(1) of 1.53% and adjusted ROATCE(1) of 17.20%. We have also seen tangible equity continue to build, with tangible book value per share increasing 23.3% over the last year. Our net interest margin (tax-equivalent basis)(1) increased 3 basis points to 4.03% while funding costs remained modest, increasing 5 basis points to 1.47%. Our asset quality remains strong with net charge-offs at 0.07% of average loans on an annualized basis during the quarter and nonperforming assets to total assets at 0.17%. We have not seen any significant signs of stress in our loan portfolio, but we continue to monitor the portfolio closely. Noninterest income remained consistent and noninterest expense of $31.3 million was up only 2.1% when compared to the third quarter of 2023, as we remain focused on operational efficiency while continuing to invest in our business. Lastly, all capital ratios had solid increases and can support future organic growth or acquisitions.\"____________________________________(1) See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most closely comparable GAAP financial measures.In addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company believes non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, which adjust for acquisition expenses, branch closure expenses, gains (losses) on closed branch premises, net earnings (losses) from closed or sold operations, charges related to termination of certain employee benefit plans, realized gains (losses) on sales of securities, and mortgage servicing rights fair value adjustments, provide investors with additional insight into its operational performance. The Company reported adjusted net income of $19.2 million, or $0.61 adjusted diluted earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2024. This compares to adjusted net income of $18.1 million, or $0.57 adjusted diluted earnings per share, for the second quarter of 2024, and adjusted net income of $20.3 million, or $0.63 adjusted diluted earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2023 (see \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" tables below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most closely comparable GAAP financial measures).Net Interest Income and Net Interest MarginNet interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $47.7 million, an increase of 1.5% from $47.0 million for the second quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to improved loan yields which were mostly offset by an increase in funding costs.Relative to the third quarter of 2023, net interest income decreased 1.1% from $48.3 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher funding costs which were partially offset by higher asset yields and an increase in interest-earning assets.Net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 3.98%, compared to 3.95% for the second quarter of 2024, and net interest margin (tax-equivalent basis) for the third quarter of 2024 was 4.03%, compared to 4.00% for the second quarter of 2024. Higher yields on interest-earning assets, which increased by 7 basis points to 5.35%, were mostly offset by an increase in funding costs, with the cost of funds increasing by 5 basis points to 1.47%.Relative to the third quarter of 2023, net interest margin decreased 9 basis points from 4.07% and net interest margin (tax-equivalent basis) decreased 10 basis points from 4.13%. These decreases were primarily attributable to increases in funding costs outpacing increases in interest-earning asset yields.____________________________________(1) See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most closely comparable GAAP financial measures.Noninterest IncomeNoninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $8.7 million, a decrease from $9.6 million for the second quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to changes in the mortgage servicing rights (\"MSR\") fair value adjustment, with a $1.5 million negative MSR fair value adjustment included in the third quarter 2024 results compared to a $0.1 million negative MSR fair value adjustment included in the second quarter 2024 results. Partially offsetting the MSR fair value adjustment was a $0.2 million increase in service charge income and a $0.2 million increase in other noninterest income, primarily attributable to swap fee income.Relative to the third quarter of 2023, noninterest income decreased 8.3% from $9.5 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to the $1.5 million negative MSR fair value adjustment included in the third quarter 2024 results, partially offset by the absence of $0.8 million in realized losses on the sale of securities included in the third quarter 2023 results.Noninterest ExpenseNoninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $31.3 million, a 2.7% increase from $30.5 million for the second quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to a $0.5 million increase in occupancy expense, driven in part by a seasonal increase in planned building maintenance expenses, and a $0.4 million increase in marketing and customer relations expense.Relative to the third quarter of 2023, noninterest expense increased 2.1% from $30.7 million. The increase was primarily attributable to a $0.7 million increase in salaries and a $0.4 million increase in employee benefits. Partially offsetting these increases was a $0.3 million decrease in marketing and customer relations expense.On February 1, 2023, HBT Financial completed its acquisition of Town and Country Financial Corporation (\"Town and Country\") with the core system conversion successfully completed in April 2023. Acquisition-related expenses recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 are summarized below. No Town and Country acquisition-related expenses were recognized subsequent to the second quarter of 2023.Loan PortfolioTotal loans outstanding, before allowance for credit losses, were $3.37 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with $3.39 billion at June 30, 2024, and $3.34 billion at September 30, 2023. The $15.7 million decrease from June 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to several larger commercial real estate loan payoffs due to the sale of the property and a couple of larger one-to-four family residential loan payoffs. These decreases were partially offset by increased line usage and term originations in our agricultural and farmland portfolio.DepositsTotal deposits were $4.28 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with $4.32 billion at June 30, 2024, and $4.20 billion at September 30, 2023. The $38.0 million decrease from June 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to lower balances maintained in retail accounts and a $18.3 million decrease in escrow balances related to seasonal tax payments, partially offset by increases in public funds and business accounts. Additionally, we continue to see a shift towards higher cost deposit products, with decreases in noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing demand, and savings balances being partially offset by an increase in money market and time deposit balances.Asset QualityNonperforming loans totaled $8.2 million, or 0.24% of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared with $8.4 million, or 0.25% of total loans, at June 30, 2024, and $6.7 million, or 0.20% of total loans, at September 30, 2023. Additionally, of the $8.2 million of nonperforming loans held as of September 30, 2024, $2.0 million is either wholly or partially guaranteed by the U.S. government. The $0.2 million decrease in nonperforming loans from June 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to the payoff of $0.1 million in nonaccrual agricultural and farmland loans.The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $0.6 million for the third quarter of 2024. The provision for credit losses primarily reflects a $1.2 million increase in required reserves resulting from changes in economic forecasts; a $0.2 million increase in required reserves resulting from qualitative factor changes; a $0.6 million decrease in required reserves driven by decreased loan balances and changes within the loan portfolio; and a $0.2 million decrease in specific reserves.The Company had net charge-offs of $0.6 million, or 0.07% of average loans on an annualized basis, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to net charge-offs of $0.7 million, or 0.08% of average loans on an annualized basis, for the second quarter of 2024, and net recoveries of $0.1 million, or 0.01% of average loans on an annualized basis, for the third quarter of 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, net charge-offs were primarily recognized in the commercial and industrial category which had $0.7 million of net charge-offs.The Company's allowance for credit losses was 1.22% of total loans and 499% of nonperforming loans at September 30, 2024, compared with 1.21% of total loans and 484% of nonperforming loans at June 30, 2024. In addition, the allowance for credit losses on unfunded lending-related commitments totaled $4.1 million as of September 30, 2024, compared with $4.3 million as of June 30, 2024.CapitalAs of September 30, 2024, the Company exceeded all regulatory capital requirements under Basel III as summarized in the following table:The ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets increased to 9.35% as of September 30, 2024, from 8.74% as of June 30, 2024, and tangible book value per share increased by $0.91 to $14.55 as of September 30, 2024, when compared to June 30, 2024.During the third quarter of 2024, the Company did not repurchase shares of its common stock under its stock repurchase program. The Company's Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $15 million of HBT Financial common stock under its stock repurchase program, which is in effect until January 1, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had $10.6 million remaining under the stock repurchase program.____________________________________(1) See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most closely comparable GAAP financial measures.About HBT Financial, Inc.HBT Financial, Inc., headquartered in Bloomington, Illinois, is the holding company for Heartland Bank and Trust Company, and has banking roots that can be traced back to 1920.

Republican-led states have restricted access to abortion since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. About half of states now ban or severely restrict abortion, which has coincided with steep declines in prescriptions for birth control and emergency contraception in those states.",

    "content": "Donald Trump is looking to capitalise on the rift that has appeared between Jewish voters, some who feel Democrats have a growing faction which accuses Israelis of committing crimes in Gaza.For Rona Kaufman, the signs are everywhere that more Jews feel abandoned by the Democratic Party and may vote for Republican Donald Trump.It's in her Facebook feed. It's in the discomfort she observed during a question-and-answer at a recent Democratic Party campaign event in Pittsburgh. It's in her own family.\"The family that is my generation and older generations, I don't think anybody is voting for Harris, and we've never voted Republican, ever,\" Kaufman, 49, said, referring to Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. \"My sister has a Trump sign outside her house, and that is a huge shift.\"How big a shift? Surveys continue to find that most Jewish voters still support the Democratic ticket, and Kaufman acknowledges that she's an exception.Still, any shift could have enormous implications in Pennsylvania, where tens of thousands of votes decided the past two presidential elections. Many Jewish voters say the 2024 presidential election is like no other in memory, coming amid the growing fallout from Hamas' brutal attack on Israelis last year.Jews represent a sliver of the voting-age population in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, the so-called blue wall of states that Democrats have come to rely on in recent presidential elections. In a close election, they are a big enough constituency that the campaigns of Harris and Trump see the potential for any slippage to swing a close contest.That has forced Harris to walk a line between traditional Democratic constituencies with strong feelings about the war in Gaza, both Jews and Arab Americans -- balancing support for Israel with outrage over the deaths of Israeli and Palestinian civilians and destruction in the region. The Biden administration has been pressuring Israel to end its attacks, which continued last week with the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by Israeli troops.Trump has looked to exploit the opening among Jewish voters especially, saying Harris \" doesn't like \" Jewish people, Jews who don't vote for him \"need their head examined \" and that he'll be the \" best friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the White House.\"In the past, surveys have shown that Jews overwhelmingly vote Democratic. A Pew Research Center poll released last month found that about two-thirds of Jewish voters backed Harris. In 2020, about 7 in 10 Jewish voters supported President Joe Biden, according to AP VoteCast.The question is whether that has changed, as Jews now see Israel's survival in a new light as its war with Hamas widens to Hezbollah and Iran.That has put a new focus on the relationship between Israel and the US, which continues to provide military aid. And many Jews say rising acts of antisemitism in the United States and anti-Israel protests sweeping across cities and college campuses -- including in Philadelphia -- have made them feel unsafe.In Pennsylvania, still fresh in many minds is a gunman absorbed by white supremacist ideology murdering 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018, the deadliest attack on Jews in US history.As Pennsylvania plays a central role in the election, many say they've never seen such outreach from campaigns as they have now.From Trump on down, Republicans are attempting to win over Jewish voters by highlighting a Democratic Party torn between its traditional and unconditional support for Israel and a growing faction that has accused Israel of war crimes in Gaza, called for Israel to unconditionally stop attacking Hamas, and demanded that the US end its military support for Israel.For some Jews who typically vote Democratic, that has resonated.\"I think that there are folks who are reluctant Trump voters who feel scared as Jews in this country,\" said Jeremy Kazzaz, a Pittsburgh resident and Harris supporter.Kazzaz, however, said Harris has a long record of fighting antisemitism that is relatively unknown to many voters.He pointed out that the Biden administration tapped her husband, Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, to lead a task force to develop a strategy to fight antisemitism well before Hamas attacked Israel. Emhoff has been a key surrogate, campaigning in front of Jewish audiences in the Philadelphia suburbs and speaking at the groundbreaking of a new complex replacing Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue.Still, where Harris' supporters see strong support of Israel -- for instance, the Biden administration sent a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery to Israel, along with the troops needed to operate it -- others see conditional support.That includes Biden urging Israel not to hit Iran's nuclear program or oil fields. At the same time, Biden has stressed his administration's support for Israel and, in her remarks on the anniversary of Hamas' attack, Harris said she'll \"always ensure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself and that I will always work to ensure the safety and security of the Jewish people here and around the world.\"Steve Rosenberg, of Philadelphia, who voted for Trump in 2016 and then Biden in 2020, will vote for Trump in 2024. In large part, Rosenberg sees Biden's lifting of Trump-era sanctions on Iran as providing the cash for the Islamic Republic to finance a war against Israel. Trump imposed the sanctions after voiding a treaty the Obama administration had reached to slow Iran's progress toward nuclear weapons, which he called a bad deal.\"The question is, 'Who is better off today than four years ago?'\" Rosenberg said. \"And the answer is Iran and the mullahs and their proxies, and it's because Biden and Kamala Harris have capitulated to Iran.\"Kaufman, a self-described progressive who lives in Pittsburgh's heavily Jewish Squirrel Hill neighborhood, never thought she would vote for Trump.But now, she expects Trump will continue a hardline stance against Iran -- which she calls an imminent threat to democracy, human rights and western civilization -- and worries that Harris will appease Iran and pander to the party's left wing.Jews with very strong connections to Israel -- her parents were born there and her daughter just finished a two-year eight-month mandatory service with the Israeli army -- are similarly conflicted over supporting Harris, Kaufman said. \"I'm saying it out loud everywhere, but most people aren't saying it out loud.\"Many Jews who support Harris, however, say they see Trump as a threat to democracy.That's important, they say, because minorities -- including Jews -- have reason to fear persecution under dictators.They can unfurl a list of comments by Trump that they see as threatening: using the military against domestic enemies, peddling dual-loyalty tropes about Jews, setting up Jews as scapegoats if he loses and, in the days after Hamas' attack, criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while praising Hezbollah as \"very smart.\"Emhoff called Trump a \"known antisemite.\"Some see Trump's efforts on Jan. 6, 2021, to stay in power as a threat. Many are wary of his affinity for dictators, and bring up his dinner at his Mar-a-Lago resort with far-right activist Nick Fuentes and rapper Ye, two men known for spewing antisemitic rhetoric.\"That's the conversation that I'm having with Jews,\" said Rabbi Beth Janus of Philadelphia.Janus said Jews she knows are excited that a woman could be president and that she's married to a Jewish man. Conversely, Trump's support for Israel is transactional, she said.\"When it serves his needs, his objectives, he supports Israel,\" Janus said. \"But if it didn't, then he wouldn't support Israel.\"",

    "title": "A colossal backfire against the trans industry",
    "content": "Rarely do I read legal opinions that make my jaw drop in amazement, but an unequivocal amicus brief for an upcoming Supreme Court case involving the trans-ing of children has done just that.In what I consider to be a colossal backfire against the transgender industry, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall's friend of the court brief in the Skrmetti matter -- which the U.S. Supreme Court will hear on December 4th and centers around Tennessee's ban on gender medicalization for minors -- spells out in considerable detail the maddening shenanigans of an organization that belongs on the ash heap of history, the World Professional Association of Transgender Health (WPATH). What is more, our federal government is complicit in what I and many others believe is a breathtakingly horrendous medical scandal. One of the worst offenders is Admiral Rachel Levine, a repulsive man who claims to be a woman and the current Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services.None of the contents in Alabama's opinion were particularly new for those of us who have closely followed these issues but the whole 52-page opinion is worth reading. It is encouraging to see it concisely distilled in one place, knowing that Supreme Court clerks and the justices will be reviewing it.Urging the high court to side with Tennessee, Alabama delineates its findings regarding the enormous fraud of so-called \"gender-affirming care,\" which came about due to a lawsuit, Boe v. Marshall. The Boe case was set in motion as a result of the Biden administration and interest groups challenging Alabama's 2022 law barring the administration of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and the performing of trans surgeries on minors. We would not know much of what follows but for the discovery process that took place precisely because of this lawsuit.Marshall's opinion documents how the authors of WPATH's vaunted guidelines, the 8th version of its Standards of Care (SOC-8), acted on the advice of \"social justice lawyers  spoke with\" and deliberately opted to not seek a scientific review of the evidence for treating gender confusion with hormones and surgeries by heavy hitters like Johns Hopkins University. WPATH intentionally chose not to engage the science but still approved their recommendations since \"evidence-based review reveals little or no evidence and puts us in an untenable position in terms of affecting policy or winning lawsuits.\"And yet, WPATH members have repeatedly framed these interventions as both \"medically necessary\" and supported by a robust evidence base when, in fact, the exact opposite is true. Their internal communications revealed that their goals were transparently political ones bent toward legal victories, not clinical best practices. To call this a \"scandal\" is the understatement of the century.Marshall also shines a light on the major players, namely, former WPATH president Marci Bowers, who has performed thousands of trans surgeries including the genital operations on TLC star Jazz Jennings, and Dr. Eli Coleman, professor emeritus at the University of Minnesota who headed the writing of WPATH SOC-8. That matters because the antics of these men have not been adequately scrutinized and they have been among the most prominent voices that have been quoted in the mainstream press as experts in the field. The truth is that they are activists engaged in deceptive chicanery of the worst sort, putting children's lives and health at risk. With the publication of the WPATH files earlier this year, which are chock-full of child-endangering statements from WPATH members, the appalling behavior of this organization and its leaders is undeniable.Perhaps worst of all, a federal government agency was involved in this scandal, specifically Sec. Levine at HHS. Uncovered emails show that Levine pushed back against any age restrictions for these experimental interventions in the SOC-8 and his advocacy influenced the final version which did not contain any limits except for one specific surgery, the phalloplasty, recommending patients be over 18. In that procedure, doctors surgically harvest tissue from a donor site on the body, usually the forearm or thigh, to construct a fake, non-functional penis for trans-identifying females.The Alabama amicus does not shrink back from exposing the most disturbing areas of the transgender abyss, even the most deranged section of SOC-8. According to WPATH's guidelines, \"eunuchs\" are among the groups of \"gender-diverse\" people who may need these interventions.Only in the reprobate minds of trans cultists are castrated males a \"gender.\"When asked during his deposition \"n the case of a physically healthy man with no recognized mental health conditions and who presents as a eunuch seeking castration, but no finding is made that he's actually at high risk of self-castration, nevertheless, WPATH's official position is that that castration may be a medically necessary procedure?\" Coleman replied: \"That's correct.\"The opinion dares to ask: \"How did WPATH learn that castration constitutes 'medically necessary gender-affirming care?'\"The answer is a foul, exceedingly perverse corner of the internet. No, really.Referenced in the opinion's footnotes is the astonishing investigative work of Reduxx magazine whose journalists infiltrated the Eunuch Archive -- a child castration fetish forum of academics and others who host and create grotesque written pornography containing narratives in which doctors rape and torture children whose puberty was stunted. Among the many depravities their deep-dive reporting revealed was that two Eunuch Archive members were invited to speak at WPATH conferences, including the 2011 meeting in Atlanta, Georgia where \"Gender Identity Disorder\" was declassified as a psychological condition and was strategically rebranded as \"gender dysphoria.\"Although the issue of trans-ing children and gender ideology more broadly has not manifested so much in the 2024 presidential election, except for a few occasional oblique references, something seems to be simmering beneath the surface.On June 27, the day of the presidential debate that led to President Joe Biden exiting the race, the Biden administration said through a spokesperson that they were opposed to trans surgeries for minors. As far as I'm aware, this marked the first time that the White House had ever expressed anything unsupportive of gender identity ideology. Unsurprisingly, they backpedaled days later, but the statement appeared to be either a political calculation should President Donald Trump dare to bring up the issue that night at the debate (he didn't) or, and this is more likely, because of the reporting that emerged that exposed Sec. Levine's arguing against age restrictions for trans-medical procedures.While future Supreme Court rulings can be hard to predict, the Alabama opinion makes a compelling case that Tennessee should win given the pseudoscience upon which \"gender-affirming care\" rests. At the least, if there is any justice left in the world, it should certainly be the final nail in WPATH's coffin.And just to reiterate, we would never know most of this damning information except for the remarkable work of the Alabama Attorney General's office.The Yellowhammer state's motto is \"Audemus jura nostra defendere\" which appears on its coat of arms and means \"We dare maintain our rights.\"With this barnburner of a legal opinion, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall has done so in spades in defense of children.",

    "content": "A Donald Trump MAGA supporter trolled Taylor Swift with JD Vance's comments about 'childless cat ladies' ahead of her Eras gig in Miami.For context, clips resurfaced earlier this year of Trump's running mate making the comments to Tucker Carlson in 2021, in which he claimed America was being run by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too\".On Saturday (19 October), a plane was spotted flying over the Hard Rock Stadium reading: \"Trump 2024 - Ready For It. Cat Lady? MAGA!\"The footage was soon shared on X/Twitter, with one writing: \"Imagine spending all that money on something you can hardly see.\"Another quipped: \"Trump and his Trumpies need to stop using Taylor Swift for clout. It's not happening. Taylor already endorsed Kamala. Stick to your support from Bryce Hall and Lil Pump.\"On Friday morning, Swift turned to Instagram with a clip of her and her cat, Olivia Benson, with the caption: \"Back in the office... #MiamiTSTheErasTour\".The brief clip was set to GloRilla and Sexyy Red's song 'Whatchu Kno About Me'.It comes after Swift publicly endorsed Kamala Harris on social media last month in a lengthy post.\"I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them,\" she penned. \"I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.\"She concluded the statement by signing off as \"Childless Cat Lady\".",

    "title": "Kamala Harris targets Nikki Haley voters with Liz Cheney",
    "content": "Vice President Kamala Harris is joining forces again with Republican former congresswoman Liz Cheney, a prominent critic of Donald Trump, in a series of moderated conversations aimed at courting voters disillusioned by the former president's influence over the Republican Party.With the 2024 presidential election fast approaching, Harris is focusing her campaign efforts on winning over key Republican voters in three suburban battleground counties that were previously carried by Nikki Haley during the GOP primaries: Chester County, Pennsylvania; Oakland County, Michigan; and Waukesha County, Wisconsin.Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin are vital bricks in Harris' path to the White House; no Democrat has won a presidential election without Pennsylvania since 1948, and holding on to the three so-called Rust Belt states (along with Nebraska's Democrat-leaning second district) will give the vice president exactly 270 Electoral College votes - the winning threshold.The first conversation will take place in Chester County in the early afternoon. The second will be held in Waukesha County in the afternoon, and the third will be hosted in Oakland County in the evening.The conversations will be moderated by Charlie Sykes, a conservative radio host and editor-in-chief of The Bulwark, and GOP strategist Sarah Longwell.Haley, who served as an ambassador to the United Nations in Trump's administration, endorsed the Republican nominee after she withdrew her bid for the presidency, but her supporters haven't necessarily followed suit.According to Politico, some of Haley's supporters are undecided; they do not support Trump and will not vote for him, and Haley herself had been critical of Trump before endorsing him. These undecided voters are critical for Harris, who may, like Cheney, have not voted for a Democrat before but are willing to in this election.These events come shortly after over 100 former GOP officeholders and officials joined Harris to campaign in Pennsylvania.\"Harris' appearances with Cheney aim to reassure voters, especially suburban ones, that she is not the extreme leftist that Trump and GOP strategists portray her as being,\" said Iwan Morgan, Emeritus Professor of US history at the Institute of the Americas, University College London.Morgan told Newsweek that Cheney \"has clear differences of opinion with Harris on policy but has always emphasized that their unity over upholding constitutional government and the rule of law is far stronger than their differences.\"Morgan added that this reinforces Harris' claim that she will be a president for \"all Americans,\" and \"offer bipartisan validation for Harris's claim that a second Trump term would pose a threat to American democracy.\"\"Playing the bipartisan card has a long tradition in US presidential politics,\" he said.Harris is likely to highlight the difference between herself as a candidate, and Trump.An email shared with Newsweek by the Harris campaign said that: \"Harris and Cheney plan to warn about the risk of a second Trump term for America and lay out the Vice President's agenda for a New Way Forward for the American people that focuses on their needs, not the division and chaos of Donald Trump.\"As Harris is targeting swing voters, she will likely address the key issues for voters in the election, including the economy, immigration and reproductive rights.",

    "title": "New cases of political violence roil U.S. ahead of contentious election",
    "content": "(Reuters) - - In York, Pennsylvania, a man accosted a group of people rallying for Vice President Kamala Harris' White House campaign, punching a 74-year-old man in the head and calling another man a \"n -- supporter\" as he fled.In northern Michigan, an assailant enraged by his hatred of Donald Trump used an all-terrain vehicle to run over and injure an 81-year-old man who was putting up a yard sign for the former president's reelection bid.The recent attacks were among at least 300 cases of political violence identified by Reuters since Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, including at least 51 incidents this year. With just two weeks to go before the Nov. 5 presidential election, the cases are part of the biggest and most sustained increase in U.S. political violence since the 1970s.Some of the violence has been reported widely, most notably two assassination attempts on Trump, a Republican. Other high-profile incidents include three shootings in recent weeks at a Democratic campaign office for Harris in Arizona.But Reuters documented scores of other cases on contentious political issues - from election disputes to LGBTQ+ rights and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Incidents ranged from small fights over political signs to more violent brawls and property destruction at rallies. Most of this year's violence wasn't fatal with the exception of two deaths: a spectator killed during July's attempt on Trump's life and the shooter.The pace of cases has remained remarkably consistent since beginning to rise in 2016, around the time of Trump's first presidential run. In 2021, which included the tumult that followed Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election, there were 93 cases of political violence, followed by 79 in 2022, and 76 in 2023.Political extremism experts warn that the charged atmosphere around the 2024 presidential election has created a highly volatile situation. Trump in particular often uses incendiary rhetoric, threatening to put his political enemies on trial and to deploy the military against the \"radical left\", calling them \"the enemy within.\"Americans are starting to see violence as \"part of the way politics happens,\" said Nealin Parker, who heads Common Ground USA, a nonprofit that studies ways to bridge America's political and cultural divides. In the current climate of mistrust, she added, \"incidents of violence can metastasize into something bigger.\"Robert Pape, a University of Chicago professor who studies political violence, expressed concern over the prospect of post-election violence in battleground states, where the margin of victory could be a few thousand votes. He likened it to \"a wildfire season\" with lots of \"dry combustible material\" and the \"potential for lightning strikes.\"Trump himself has declined to rule out the possibility of violence if he loses in November. When asked by Time magazine in April if he expected violence after the election, he said, \"If we don't win, you know, it depends.\" He has told supporters that any loss in this year's race would be due to fraud.The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment. The Trump campaign, when asked about the steady rise of political violence and the recent attacks against Harris and Trump supporters, provided a statement attacking Harris on immigration and criminal justice reform.\"DOING MY PART\"The highest-profile case of recent political violence was the first assassination attempt on Trump at a July 13 campaign rally in Pennsylvania. The shooter, Thomas Crooks, was killed at the scene. He had no \"definitive ideology,\" federal investigators concluded.Law enforcement agencies were put on alert for potential retaliatory violence by Trump supporters. There were some concerning incidents, including a man in Florida who told his wife he was \"preparing for war\" after the shooting and left home with multiple guns, according to police reports. He was found burying a full ammunition box in a public park. Police seized seven rifles and handguns, and had the man hospitalized for a mental health evaluation.But the anger wasn't confined to Trump's supporters.\nKemppainen, 22 and unemployed, went on a vandalism spree eight days later in his town of Hancock, population 4,500, which mostly backed Trump in the 2020 election.On July 21, when President Joe Biden quit the presidential race and endorsed Harris, Kemppainen rode an all-terrain vehicle through the streets and targeted Trump supporters, said Hancock Police Department chief Tami Sleeman in an interview.Reuters pieced together what happened from police reports obtained in a records request, copies of chat messages provided by Kemppainen's associates and police, and a video Kemppainen posted on Discord.He vandalized a pickup truck with a Trump sticker, deflating its tires, tearing off a side mirror and smashing its windows. He also damaged a truck with a pro-police decal. He posted a video of one attack on Discord with the comment \"doing my part.\" Then he tore up Trump yard signs and threw them into the street.When an onlooker, Carl Nelson, 81, replanted the signs, Kemppainen ran him over with the ATV and fled, hospitalizing the Vietnam veteran.The next day, Kemppainen rang Hancock Police: \"I am calling to confess to a crime,\" he said in a message describing his rampage, according to a recording police shared with Reuters. \"So if you could send someone to pick me up. I appreciate it.\"When police heard the voicemail two hours later, they worried the caller sounded unbalanced and dispatched six officers, said Sleeman, the chief. By the time they arrived, Kemppainen had fatally shot himself with an assault rifle, a police report said. His father said Kemppainen was on anti-depression medication and also had an autism diagnosis, the report added. In an interview, a family member confirmed that Kemppainen struggled with mental health issues.Nelson, who Kemppainen attacked, told Reuters he spent several days in the hospital for knee and upper body injuries. \"This was such a peaceful area,\" said Nelson. He has decided to vote for Trump, he added.On Sept. 15, a second assassination attempt on Trump refocused attention on the risk of political violence in this year's election. Suspect Ryan Routh had waited for hours with an assault rifle by Trump's golf course in West Palm Beach when an agent spotted him in shrubbery and fired. Routh fled and was apprehended quickly.Eleven days later, in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, Alan Vandersloot, a 74-year-old local borough councilman, stood with a Harris sign among about a dozen of her supporters at a rally in York, a city of nearly 45,000 in a county that broadly backed Trump in 2020.As the rally was ending, Vandersloot told Reuters, a man grabbed him from behind and slammed him to the pavement, opening a two-inch gash on his forehead. The attacker, Robert Trotta, punched Vandersloot repeatedly before fleeing, two witnesses said in interviews.When another rallygoer, Dan Almoney, gave chase, Trotta called him \"a n -- - supporter,\" Almoney said. Almoney interpreted the slur as a reference to Harris and her backers, he said. Trotta, Vandersloot and Almoney are white.Trotta, unable to post bail, has yet to make a plea on assault and harassment charges, court records show. His lawyer declined to comment. Trotta is a registered Republican, according to state records. His social media posts, from an account last active in 2020, supported Trump and criticized Democrats.A York City Police Department spokesperson, Captain Daniel Lentz, said he didn't believe Trotta's attack was \"politically motivated\" because Trotta previously pleaded guilty to two cases of harassment in which he struck random people. The police report, however, did not include statements from Vandersloot and Almoney, who both said they believed the attack was political. Lentz said he didn't know why the police didn't record their accounts.NEW ISSUES, NEW VIOLENCEThere's no government data on political violence, though several universities and private research groups track it in various ways, typically using databases built on news accounts. Some include random hate crimes; others, including Reuters, do not. Most have not released comprehensive data since 2020.The 300 cases identified by Reuters were culled from records on thousands of violent crimes since the 2021 Capitol attack. Most of that data was captured initially by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, a global violence-tracking project run by a nonpartisan research group in Wisconsin. Reporters identified additional cases using news databases, court filings and police reports obtained through public records requests.Some of the cases don't break down along traditional partisan lines, including those linked to disputes over the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.That was the case last month when Caleb Gannon, a pro-Palestinian critic of U.S. government support for Israel, began heckling a pro-Israel rally in Newton, Massachusetts. Cell phone video shows Gannon shouting, \"You're supporting genocide!\" before running into the crowd and tackling Scott Hayes, a fervent backer of Israel.Earlier this year, Hayes, an Iraq War veteran, posted a photo on social media of a handgun with a Star of David pendant and the message \"Hey Jew Haters. Bring it.\" As they wrestled on the ground, Hayes shot Gannon in the abdomen.Hayes, 47, is awaiting trial after pleading not guilty to assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. The county prosecutor has said an assault and battery charge also will be pursued against Gannon, 31, who remains hospitalized. Hayes' lawyer said he will argue self-defense but declined further comment.Other cases are directly linked to the election.On Sept. 26, a Michigan man was arrested for assaulting a U.S. Postal Service worker who delivered a Harris campaign mailer to his house. The postal worker was in her truck when Russell Valleau, 61, approached on a bike, yelling that he \"did not want that 'Black bitch' in his mailbox,\" according to police records and a statement from the Oakland County prosecutor.When the postal worker, who is Black, told Valleau to back away, he called her a \"Black bitch\" and lunged at her with a knife, according to her account to the Farmington Hills Police Department. She sprayed him with dog repellent, and he retreated. \"I just had a man come to me with a knife and try to stab me,\" she said moments later in a call to police, according to a recording obtained through a records request. \"I sprayed him.\"Police reported finding Valleau lying in a nearby yard, apparently intoxicated and suffering the effects of chemical repellant. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of assault and battery and ethnic intimidation. His lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.In another case this summer, four white men in a pick-up truck rolled up to a rural home in coastal North Carolina and asked three Black teens in the yard \"if they liked Donald Trump,\" according to a report from the Pasquotank County Sheriff's Office. When the youths said, \"No,\" the report said, the men opened fired with a BB gun, hitting one youth in the leg and another in the buttocks. The shots also broke windows on the house, a shed and a car out front.The truck drove off. Police are investigating the case as an assault with a deadly weapon and have no suspects. The children suffered minor injuries and declined medical treatment.Christian Gilyard, the youths' father, said political tensions have become more pronounced since the contested 2020 election, but he never expected problems in his own neighborhood. \"It's shocking,\" he said, \"that something like this would happen here.\"(Peter Eisler reported from Washington.

    "content": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- For Rona Kaufman, the signs are everywhere that more Jews feel abandoned by the Democratic Party and may vote for Republican Donald Trump.It's in her Facebook feed. It's in the discomfort she observed during a question-and-answer at a recent Democratic Party campaign event in Pittsburgh. It's in her own family.\"The family that is my generation and older generations, I don't think anybody is voting for Harris, and we've never voted Republican, ever,\" Kaufman, 49, said, referring to Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. \"My sister has a Trump sign outside her house, and that is a huge shift.\"How big a shift? Surveys continue to find that most Jewish voters still support the Democratic ticket, and Kaufman acknowledges that she's an exception.Still, any shift could have enormous implications in Pennsylvania, where tens of thousands of votes decided the past two presidential elections. Many Jewish voters say the 2024 presidential election is like no other in memory, coming amid the growing fallout from Hamas' brutal attack on Israelis last year.Jews represent a sliver of the voting-age population in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, the so-called blue wall of states that Democrats have come to rely on in recent presidential elections. In a close election, they are a big enough constituency that the campaigns of Harris and Trump see the potential for any slippage to swing a close contest.That has forced Harris to walk a line between traditional Democratic constituencies with strong feelings about the war in Gaza, both Jews and Arab Americans -- balancing support for Israel with outrage over the deaths of Israeli and Palestinian civilians and destruction in the region. The Biden administration has been pressuring Israel to end its attacks, which continued last week with the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by Israeli troops.Trump has looked to exploit the opening among Jewish voters especially, saying Harris \" doesn't like \" Jewish people, Jews who don't vote for him \"need their head examined \" and that he'll be the \" best friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the White House.\"In the past, surveys have shown that Jews overwhelmingly vote Democratic. A Pew Research Center poll released last month found that about two-thirds of Jewish voters back Harris. In 2020, about 7 in 10 Jewish voters supported President Joe Biden, according to AP VoteCast.The question is whether that has changed, as Jews now see Israel's survival in a new light as its war with Hamas widens to Hezbollah and possibly Iran.That has put a new focus on the relationship between Israel and the U.S., which continues to provide military aid. And many Jews say rising acts of antisemitism in the United States and anti-Israel protests sweeping across cities and college campuses -- including in Philadelphia -- have made them feel unsafe.In Pennsylvania, still fresh in many minds is a gunman absorbed by white supremacist ideology murdering 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018, the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.As Pennsylvania plays a central role in the election, many say they've never seen such outreach from campaigns as they have now.From Trump on down, Republicans are attempting to win over Jewish voters by highlighting a Democratic Party torn between its traditional and unconditional support for Israel and a growing faction that has accused Israel of war crimes in Gaza, called for Israel to unconditionally stop attacking Hamas, and demanded that the U.S. end its military support for Israel.For some Jews who typically vote Democratic, that has resonated.\"I think that there are folks who are reluctant Trump voters who feel scared as Jews in this country,\" said Jeremy Kazzaz, a Pittsburgh resident and Harris supporter.Kazzaz, however, said Harris has a long record of fighting antisemitism that is relatively unknown to many voters.He pointed out that the Biden administration tapped her husband, Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, to lead a task force to develop a strategy to fight antisemitism well before Hamas attacked Israel. Emhoff has been a key surrogate, campaigning in front of Jewish audiences in the Philadelphia suburbs and speaking at the groundbreaking of a new complex replacing Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue.Still, where Harris' supporters see strong support of Israel -- for instance, the Biden administration sent a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery to Israel, along with the troops needed to operate it -- others see conditional support.That includes Biden urging Israel not to hit Iran's nuclear program or oil fields. At the same time, Biden has stressed his administration's support for Israel and, in her remarks on the anniversary of Hamas' attack, Harris said she'll \"always ensure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself and that I will always work to ensure the safety and security of the Jewish people here and around the world.\"Steve Rosenberg, of Philadelphia, who voted for Trump in 2016 and then Biden in 2020, will vote for Trump in 2024. In large part, Rosenberg sees Biden's lifting of Trump-era sanctions on Iran as providing the cash for the Islamic Republic to finance a war against Israel. Trump imposed the sanctions after voiding a treaty the Obama administration had reached to slow Iran's progress toward nuclear weapons, which he called a bad deal.\"The question is, 'Who is better off today than four years ago?'\" Rosenberg said. \"And the answer is Iran and the mullahs and their proxies, and it's because Biden and Kamala Harris have capitulated to Iran.\"Kaufman, a self-described progressive who lives in Pittsburgh's heavily Jewish Squirrel Hill neighborhood, never thought she would vote for Trump.But now, she expects Trump will continue a hardline stance against Iran -- which she calls an imminent threat to democracy, human rights and western civilization -- and worries that Harris will appease Iran and pander to the party's left wing.Jews with very strong connections to Israel -- her parents were born there and her daughter just finished a two-year eight-month mandatory service with the Israeli army -- are similarly conflicted over supporting Harris, Kaufman said. \"I'm saying it out loud everywhere, but most people aren't saying it out loud.\"Many Jews who support Harris, however, say they see Trump as a threat to democracy.That's important, they say, because minorities -- including Jews -- have reason to fear persecution under dictators.They can unfurl a list of comments by Trump that they see as threatening: using the military against domestic enemies, peddling dual-loyalty tropes about Jews, setting up Jews as scapegoats if he loses and, in the days after Hamas' attack, criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while praising Hezbollah as \"very smart.\"Emhoff called Trump a \"known antisemite.\"Some see Trump's efforts on Jan. 6, 2021, to stay in power as a threat. Many are wary of his affinity for dictators, and bring up his dinner at his Mar-a-Lago resort with far-right activist Nick Fuentes and rapper Ye, two men known for spewing antisemitic rhetoric.\"That's the conversation that I'm having with Jews,\" said Rabbi Beth Janus of Philadelphia.Janus said Jews she knows are excited that a woman could be president and that she's married to a Jewish man. Conversely, Trump's support for Israel is transactional, she said.\"When it serves his needs, his objectives, he supports Israel,\" Janus said. \"But if it didn't, then he wouldn't support Israel.\"Follow Marc Levy at twitter.com/timelywriter.Marc Levy, The Associated Press",

    "title": "Political Violence During US Elections? Some Judges Fear It Could Be Coming - News18",
    "content": "A judge said he even prayed that Americans would accept the outcome of the November elections.Over the past four years, judges at Washington's federal courthouse have punished hundreds of rioters who stormed the US Capitol in an unprecedented assault on the nation's democracy. On the cusp of the next presidential election, some of those judges fear another burst of political violence could be coming.Before recently sentencing a rioter to prison, US District Judge Reggie Walton said he prays Americans accept the outcome of next month's election. But the veteran judge expressed concern that Donald Trump and his allies are spreading the same sort of conspiracy theories that fueled the mob's Jan. 6, 2021, riot.\"That sore loser is saying the same things he said before,\" Walton said earlier this month without mentioning the Republican presidential nominee by name. \"He's riling up the troops again, so if he doesn't get what he wants, it's not inconceivable that we will experience that same situation again. And who knows? It could be worse.\"Walton, a nominee of President George W. Bush, is not alone. Other judges have said the political climate is ripe for another attack like the one injured more than 100 police officers at the Capitol. As Election Day nears, judges are frequently stressing the need to send a message beyond their courtrooms that political violence can't be tolerated.\"It scares me to think about what will happen if anyone on either side is not happy with the results of the election,\" Judge Jia Cobb, a nominee of President Joe Biden, said during a sentencing hearing last month for four Capitol rioters.Judge Rudolph Contreras lamented the potential for more politically motivated violence as he sentenced a Colorado man, Jeffrey Sabol, who helped other rioters drag a police officer into the mob. Sabol later told FBI agents that a \"call to battle was announced\" and that he had \"answered the call because he was a patriot warrior.\"\"It doesn't take much imagination to imagine a similar call coming out in the coming months, and the court would be concerned that Mr. Sabol would answer that call in the same way,\" Contreras, a President Barack Obama nominee, said in March before sentencing Sabol to more than five years in prison.Trump's distortion of the Jan. 6 attack has been a cornerstone of his bid to reclaim the White House. The former president has denied any responsibility for the crimes of supporters who smashed windows, assaulted police officers and sent lawmakers running into hiding as they met to certify President Joe Biden's 2020 victory.Trump has vowed to pardon rioters, whom he calls \"patriots\" and \"hostages,\" if he wins in November. And he said he would accept the results of the upcoming election only if it's \"free and fair,\" casting doubts reminiscent of his baseless claims in 2020.Judges have repeatedly used their platform on the bench to denounce those efforts to downplay the violence on Jan. 6 and cast the rioters as political prisoners. And some have raised concerns about what such rhetoric means for the future of the country and its democracy.\"We're in a real difficult time in our country, and I hope we can survive it,\" Walton said this month while sentencing a Tennessee nurse who used a pair of medical scissors to smash a glass door at the Capitol.\"I've got a young daughter, I've got a young grandson, and I would like for America to be available to them and be as good to them as it has been to me,\" he added. \"But I don't know if we survive with the mentality that took place that day.\"More than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes related to Jan. 6 siege, which disrupted the peaceful transfer of presidential power for the first time in the nation's history. Over 1,000 rioters have been convicted and sentenced. Roughly 650 of them received prison time ranging from a few days to 22 years.Justice Department prosecutors have argued in many cases that a prison sentence is necessary to deter convicted Capitol rioters from engaging in more politically motivated violence.\"With the 2024 presidential election approaching and many loud voices in the media and online continuing to sow discord and distrust, the potential for a repeat of January 6 looms ominously,\" prosecutors have repeatedly warned in court filings.Prosecutors argue that defendants who have shown little or no remorse for their actions on Jan. 6 could break the law again. Some rioters even seem to be proud of their crimes.The first rioter to enter the Capitol texted his mother, \"I'll go again given the opportunity.\" A man from Washington state who stormed the Capitol with fellow Proud Boys extremist group members told a judge, \"You can give me 100 years and I'd do it all over again.\" A Kentucky nurse who joined the riot told a television interviewer that she would \"do it again tomorrow.\"A Colorado woman known to her social media followers as the \"J6 praying grandma\" avoided a prison sentence in August when a magistrate judge sentenced her for disorderly conduct and trespassing on Capitol grounds. Rebecca Lavrenz told the judge that God, not Trump, led her to Washington on Jan. 6.\"And she has all but promised to do it all over again,\" said prosecutor Terence Parker.Prosecutors had sought 10 months behind bars. After her April trial conviction, Lavrenz went on a \"media blitz\" to defend the mob, spread misinformation, undermine confidence in the courts and boost her celebrity in a community that believes Jan. 6 \"was a good day for this country,\" Parker said.Magistrate Zia Faruqui sentenced Lavrenz to six months of home confinement and fined her $103,000, stressing the need to \"lower the volume\" before the next election.\"These outside influences, the people that are tearing our country apart, they're not going to help you,\" Faruqui told her.",

At the same time, Biden has stressed his administration's support for Israel and, in her remarks on the anniversary of Hamas' attack, Harris said she'll \"always ensure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself and that I will always work to ensure the safety and security of the Jewish people here and around the world.\"Steve Rosenberg, of Philadelphia, who voted for Trump in 2016 and then Biden in 2020, will vote for Trump in 2024. In large part, Rosenberg sees Biden's lifting of Trump-era sanctions on Iran as providing the cash for the Islamic Republic to finance a war against Israel. Trump imposed the sanctions after voiding a treaty the Obama administration had reached to slow Iran's progress toward nuclear weapons, which he called a bad deal.\"The question is, 'Who is better off today than four years ago?'\" Rosenberg said. \"And the answer is Iran and the mullahs and their proxies, and it's because Biden and Kamala Harris have capitulated to Iran.\"Kaufman, a self-described progressive who lives in Pittsburgh's heavily Jewish Squirrel Hill neighborhood, never thought she would vote for Trump.But now, she expects Trump will continue a hardline stance against Iran -- which she calls an imminent threat to democracy, human rights and western civilization -- and worries that Harris will appease Iran and pander to the party's left wing.Jews with very strong connections to Israel -- her parents were born there and her daughter just finished a two-year eight-month mandatory service with the Israeli army -- are similarly conflicted over supporting Harris, Kaufman said. \"I'm saying it out loud everywhere, but most people aren't saying it out loud.\"Many Jews who support Harris, however, say they see Trump as a threat to democracy.That's important, they say, because minorities -- including Jews -- have reason to fear persecution under dictators.They can unfurl a list of comments by Trump that they see as threatening: using the military against domestic enemies, peddling dual-loyalty tropes about Jews, setting up Jews as scapegoats if he loses and, in the days after Hamas' attack, criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while praising Hezbollah as \"very smart.\"Emhoff called Trump a \"known antisemite.\"Some see Trump's efforts on Jan. 6, 2021, to stay in power as a threat. Many are wary of his affinity for dictators, and bring up his dinner at his Mar-a-Lago resort with far-right activist Nick Fuentes and rapper Ye, two men known for spewing antisemitic rhetoric.\"That's the conversation that I'm having with Jews,\" said Rabbi Beth Janus of Philadelphia.Janus said Jews she knows are excited that a woman could be president and that she's married to a Jewish man. Conversely, Trump's support for Israel is transactional, she said.\"When it serves his needs, his objectives, he supports Israel,\" Janus said. \"But if it didn't, then he wouldn't support Israel.\"Follow Marc Levy at twitter.com/timelywriter.",

    "title": "New Cases of Political Violence Roil U.S. Ahead of Contentious Election",
    "content": "(Reuters) - - In York, Pennsylvania, a man accosted a group of people rallying for Vice President Kamala Harris' White House campaign, punching a 74-year-old man in the head and calling another man a \"n -- supporter\" as he fled.In northern Michigan, an assailant enraged by his hatred of Donald Trump used an all-terrain vehicle to run over and injure an 81-year-old man who was putting up a yard sign for the former president's reelection bid.The recent attacks were among at least 300 cases of political violence identified by Reuters since Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, including at least 51 incidents this year. With just two weeks to go before the Nov. 5 presidential election, the cases are part of the biggest and most sustained increase in U.S. political violence since the 1970s.Some of the violence has been reported widely, most notably two assassination attempts on Trump, a Republican. Other high-profile incidents include three shootings in recent weeks at a Democratic campaign office for Harris in Arizona.But Reuters documented scores of other cases on contentious political issues - from election disputes to LGBTQ+ rights and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Incidents ranged from small fights over political signs to more violent brawls and property destruction at rallies. Most of this year's violence wasn't fatal with the exception of two deaths: a spectator killed during July's attempt on Trump's life and the shooter.The pace of cases has remained remarkably consistent since beginning to rise in 2016, around the time of Trump's first presidential run. In 2021, which included the tumult that followed Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election, there were 93 cases of political violence, followed by 79 in 2022, and 76 in 2023.Political extremism experts warn that the charged atmosphere around the 2024 presidential election has created a highly volatile situation. Trump in particular often uses incendiary rhetoric, threatening to put his political enemies on trial and to deploy the military against the \"radical left\", calling them \"the enemy within.\"Americans are starting to see violence as \"part of the way politics happens,\" said Nealin Parker, who heads Common Ground USA, a nonprofit that studies ways to bridge America's political and cultural divides. In the current climate of mistrust, she added, \"incidents of violence can metastasize into something bigger.\"Robert Pape, a University of Chicago professor who studies political violence, expressed concern over the prospect of post-election violence in battleground states, where the margin of victory could be a few thousand votes. He likened it to \"a wildfire season\" with lots of \"dry combustible material\" and the \"potential for lightning strikes.\"Trump himself has declined to rule out the possibility of violence if he loses in November. When asked by Time magazine in April if he expected violence after the election, he said, \"If we don't win, you know, it depends.\" He has told supporters that any loss in this year's race would be due to fraud.The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment. The Trump campaign, when asked about the steady rise of political violence and the recent attacks against Harris and Trump supporters, provided a statement attacking Harris on immigration and criminal justice reform.\"DOING MY PART\"The highest-profile case of recent political violence was the first assassination attempt on Trump at a July 13 campaign rally in Pennsylvania. The shooter, Thomas Crooks, was killed at the scene. He had no \"definitive ideology,\" federal investigators concluded.Law enforcement agencies were put on alert for potential retaliatory violence by Trump supporters. There were some concerning incidents, including a man in Florida who told his wife he was \"preparing for war\" after the shooting and left home with multiple guns, according to police reports. He was found burying a full ammunition box in a public park. Police seized seven rifles and handguns, and had the man hospitalized for a mental health evaluation.But the anger wasn't confined to Trump's supporters.\nKemppainen, 22 and unemployed, went on a vandalism spree eight days later in his town of Hancock, population 4,500, which mostly backed Trump in the 2020 election.On July 21, when President Joe Biden quit the presidential race and endorsed Harris, Kemppainen rode an all-terrain vehicle through the streets and targeted Trump supporters, said Hancock Police Department chief Tami Sleeman in an interview.Reuters pieced together what happened from police reports obtained in a records request, copies of chat messages provided by Kemppainen's associates and police, and a video Kemppainen posted on Discord.He vandalized a pickup truck with a Trump sticker, deflating its tires, tearing off a side mirror and smashing its windows. He also damaged a truck with a pro-police decal. He posted a video of one attack on Discord with the comment \"doing my part.\" Then he tore up Trump yard signs and threw them into the street.When an onlooker, Carl Nelson, 81, replanted the signs, Kemppainen ran him over with the ATV and fled, hospitalizing the Vietnam veteran.The next day, Kemppainen rang Hancock Police: \"I am calling to confess to a crime,\" he said in a message describing his rampage, according to a recording police shared with Reuters. \"So if you could send someone to pick me up. I appreciate it.\"When police heard the voicemail two hours later, they worried the caller sounded unbalanced and dispatched six officers, said Sleeman, the chief. By the time they arrived, Kemppainen had fatally shot himself with an assault rifle, a police report said. His father said Kemppainen was on anti-depression medication and also had an autism diagnosis, the report added. In an interview, a family member confirmed that Kemppainen struggled with mental health issues.Nelson, who Kemppainen attacked, told Reuters he spent several days in the hospital for knee and upper body injuries. \"This was such a peaceful area,\" said Nelson. He has decided to vote for Trump, he added.On Sept. 15, a second assassination attempt on Trump refocused attention on the risk of political violence in this year's election. Suspect Ryan Routh had waited for hours with an assault rifle by Trump's golf course in West Palm Beach when an agent spotted him in shrubbery and fired. Routh fled and was apprehended quickly.Eleven days later, in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, Alan Vandersloot, a 74-year-old local borough councilman, stood with a Harris sign among about a dozen of her supporters at a rally in York, a city of nearly 45,000 in a county that broadly backed Trump in 2020.As the rally was ending, Vandersloot told Reuters, a man grabbed him from behind and slammed him to the pavement, opening a two-inch gash on his forehead. The attacker, Robert Trotta, punched Vandersloot repeatedly before fleeing, two witnesses said in interviews.When another rallygoer, Dan Almoney, gave chase, Trotta called him \"a n -- - supporter,\" Almoney said. Almoney interpreted the slur as a reference to Harris and her backers, he said. Trotta, Vandersloot and Almoney are white.Trotta, unable to post bail, has yet to make a plea on assault and harassment charges, court records show. His lawyer declined to comment. Trotta is a registered Republican, according to state records. His social media posts, from an account last active in 2020, supported Trump and criticized Democrats.A York City Police Department spokesperson, Captain Daniel Lentz, said he didn't believe Trotta's attack was \"politically motivated\" because Trotta previously pleaded guilty to two cases of harassment in which he struck random people. The police report, however, did not include statements from Vandersloot and Almoney, who both said they believed the attack was political. Lentz said he didn't know why the police didn't record their accounts.NEW ISSUES, NEW VIOLENCEThere's no government data on political violence, though several universities and private research groups track it in various ways, typically using databases built on news accounts. Some include random hate crimes; others, including Reuters, do not. Most have not released comprehensive data since 2020.The 300 cases identified by Reuters were culled from records on thousands of violent crimes since the 2021 Capitol attack. Most of that data was captured initially by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, a global violence-tracking project run by a nonpartisan research group in Wisconsin. Reporters identified additional cases using news databases, court filings and police reports obtained through public records requests.Some of the cases don't break down along traditional partisan lines, including those linked to disputes over the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.That was the case last month when Caleb Gannon, a pro-Palestinian critic of U.S. government support for Israel, began heckling a pro-Israel rally in Newton, Massachusetts. Cell phone video shows Gannon shouting, \"You're supporting genocide!\" before running into the crowd and tackling Scott Hayes, a fervent backer of Israel.Earlier this year, Hayes, an Iraq War veteran, posted a photo on social media of a handgun with a Star of David pendant and the message \"Hey Jew Haters. Bring it.\" As they wrestled on the ground, Hayes shot Gannon in the abdomen.Hayes, 47, is awaiting trial after pleading not guilty to assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. The county prosecutor has said an assault and battery charge also will be pursued against Gannon, 31, who remains hospitalized. Hayes' lawyer said he will argue self-defense but declined further comment.Other cases are directly linked to the election.On Sept. 26, a Michigan man was arrested for assaulting a U.S. Postal Service worker who delivered a Harris campaign mailer to his house. The postal worker was in her truck when Russell Valleau, 61, approached on a bike, yelling that he \"did not want that 'Black bitch' in his mailbox,\" according to police records and a statement from the Oakland County prosecutor.When the postal worker, who is Black, told Valleau to back away, he called her a \"Black bitch\" and lunged at her with a knife, according to her account to the Farmington Hills Police Department. She sprayed him with dog repellent, and he retreated. \"I just had a man come to me with a knife and try to stab me,\" she said moments later in a call to police, according to a recording obtained through a records request. \"I sprayed him.\"Police reported finding Valleau lying in a nearby yard, apparently intoxicated and suffering the effects of chemical repellant. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of assault and battery and ethnic intimidation. His lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.In another case this summer, four white men in a pick-up truck rolled up to a rural home in coastal North Carolina and asked three Black teens in the yard \"if they liked Donald Trump,\" according to a report from the Pasquotank County Sheriff's Office. When the youths said, \"No,\" the report said, the men opened fired with a BB gun, hitting one youth in the leg and another in the buttocks. The shots also broke windows on the house, a shed and a car out front.The truck drove off. Police are investigating the case as an assault with a deadly weapon and have no suspects. The children suffered minor injuries and declined medical treatment.Christian Gilyard, the youths' father, said political tensions have become more pronounced since the contested 2020 election, but he never expected problems in his own neighborhood. \"It's shocking,\" he said, \"that something like this would happen here.\"(Peter Eisler reported from Washington.

It's time to get your vote on.Can you believe it? The crazy campaign season is finally drawing to an end, as today is the first day to cast your ballot in the 2024 Presidential Election.There are, however, quite a few other races that will mean something to Southeast Texans this year. We put out our Voter Guide in print Sunday to give you a better idea of the personalities asking for your vote. If you're not a print subscriber and you also don't like looking at the e-edition, those stories also are all on our website.In the meantime, I'd like to go ahead and flag the Beaumont ISD tax rate election as well as the Jefferson County tax assessor-collector as two races that deserve a bit more of your attention.2. It's a good time to be a Southeast Texas football fan.Lamar adds another to the win column, and we're gearing up for both Mid-County Madness AND the Beaumont Bowl this week?!Talk about some football bliss.But we've got even more good news. Sports Editor Matt Faye is going to devote an hour on Wednesday to chatting with all of you and answering your football questions. Click here to check out the Facebook event for more information, and make sure to click \"going\" so Facebook will remind you when it's time to chat.What kinds of things is he going to be talking about? Well, the conversation largely will be guided by all of you in the comments section. But if you want some ideas, might I suggest Nederland's big win over Lake Creek this past weekend, Port Neches-Groves' continued win streak, of course Lamar football or maybe even bringing up some of your favorites that have since moved on, like Duke's Chandler Rivers.We're excited to have this opportunity to chat with all of you. If you'd like to see a similar set up on future topics (they don't have to be sports related), please let us know!3. We might get a progress report on the Gilbert Building restoration.And even if we don't, that's something to note.This weekend marked 60 days since the Beaumont City Council decided to leave the building standing. However, as part of that decision, owner Tom Flanagan is expected to submit a progress report on the effort every 60 days.You know we'll be checking in to see what the report had to say.

With just two weeks to go before the Nov. 5 presidential election, the cases are part of the biggest and most sustained increase in U.S. political violence since the 1970s.Some of the violence has been reported widely, most notably two assassination attempts on Trump, a Republican. Other high-profile incidents include three shootings in recent weeks at a Democratic campaign office for Harris in Arizona.But Reuters documented scores of other cases on contentious political issues - from election disputes to LGBTQ+ rights and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Incidents ranged from small fights over political signs to more violent brawls and property destruction at rallies. Most of this year's violence wasn't fatal with the exception of two deaths: a spectator killed during July's attempt on Trump's life and the shooter.The pace of cases has remained remarkably consistent since beginning to rise in 2016, around the time of Trump's first presidential run. In 2021, which included the tumult that followed Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election, there were 93 cases of political violence, followed by 79 in 2022, and 76 in 2023.Political extremism experts warn that the charged atmosphere around the 2024 presidential election has created a highly volatile situation. Trump in particular often uses incendiary rhetoric, threatening to put his political enemies on trial and to deploy the military against the \"radical left\", calling them \"the enemy within.\"Americans are starting to see violence as \"part of the way politics happens,\" said Nealin Parker, who heads Common Ground USA, a nonprofit that studies ways to bridge America's political and cultural divides. In the current climate of mistrust, she added, \"incidents of violence can metastasize into something bigger.\"Robert Pape, a University of Chicago professor who studies political violence, expressed concern over the prospect of post-election violence in battleground states, where the margin of victory could be a few thousand votes. He likened it to \"a wildfire season\" with lots of \"dry combustible material\" and the \"potential for lightning strikes.\"Trump himself has declined to rule out the possibility of violence if he loses in November. When asked by Time magazine in April if he expected violence after the election, he said, \"If we don't win, you know, it depends.\" He has told supporters that any loss in this year's race would be due to fraud.The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment. The Trump campaign, when asked about the steady rise of political violence and the recent attacks against Harris and Trump supporters, provided a statement attacking Harris on immigration and criminal justice reform.\"DOING MY PART\"The highest-profile case of recent political violence was the first assassination attempt on Trump at a July 13 campaign rally in Pennsylvania. The shooter, Thomas Crooks, was killed at the scene. He had no \"definitive ideology,\" federal investigators concluded.Law enforcement agencies were put on alert for potential retaliatory violence by Trump supporters. There were some concerning incidents, including a man in Florida who told his wife he was \"preparing for war\" after the shooting and left home with multiple guns, according to police reports. He was found burying a full ammunition box in a public park. Police seized seven rifles and handguns, and had the man hospitalized for a mental health evaluation.But the anger wasn't confined to Trump's supporters.\nKemppainen, 22 and unemployed, went on a vandalism spree eight days later in his town of Hancock, population 4,500, which mostly backed Trump in the 2020 election.On July 21, when President Joe Biden quit the presidential race and endorsed Harris, Kemppainen rode an all-terrain vehicle through the streets and targeted Trump supporters, said Hancock Police Department chief Tami Sleeman in an interview.Reuters pieced together what happened from police reports obtained in a records request, copies of chat messages provided by Kemppainen's associates and police, and a video Kemppainen posted on Discord.He vandalized a pickup truck with a Trump sticker, deflating its tires, tearing off a side mirror and smashing its windows. He also damaged a truck with a pro-police decal. He posted a video of one attack on Discord with the comment \"doing my part.\" Then he tore up Trump yard signs and threw them into the street.When an onlooker, Carl Nelson, 81, replanted the signs, Kemppainen ran him over with the ATV and fled, hospitalizing the Vietnam veteran.The next day, Kemppainen rang Hancock Police: \"I am calling to confess to a crime,\" he said in a message describing his rampage, according to a recording police shared with Reuters. \"So if you could send someone to pick me up. I appreciate it.\"When police heard the voicemail two hours later, they worried the caller sounded unbalanced and dispatched six officers, said Sleeman, the chief. By the time they arrived, Kemppainen had fatally shot himself with an assault rifle, a police report said. His father said Kemppainen was on anti-depression medication and also had an autism diagnosis, the report added. In an interview, a family member confirmed that Kemppainen struggled with mental health issues.Nelson, who Kemppainen attacked, told Reuters he spent several days in the hospital for knee and upper body injuries. \"This was such a peaceful area,\" said Nelson. He has decided to vote for Trump, he added.On Sept. 15, a second assassination attempt on Trump refocused attention on the risk of political violence in this year's election. Suspect Ryan Routh had waited for hours with an assault rifle by Trump's golf course in West Palm Beach when an agent spotted him in shrubbery and fired. Routh fled and was apprehended quickly.Eleven days later, in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, Alan Vandersloot, a 74-year-old local borough councilman, stood with a Harris sign among about a dozen of her supporters at a rally in York, a city of nearly 45,000 in a county that broadly backed Trump in 2020.As the rally was ending, Vandersloot told Reuters, a man grabbed him from behind and slammed him to the pavement, opening a two-inch gash on his forehead. The attacker, Robert Trotta, punched Vandersloot repeatedly before fleeing, two witnesses said in interviews.When another rallygoer, Dan Almoney, gave chase, Trotta called him \"a n -- - supporter,\" Almoney said. Almoney interpreted the slur as a reference to Harris and her backers, he said. Trotta, Vandersloot and Almoney are white.Trotta, unable to post bail, has yet to make a plea on assault and harassment charges, court records show. His lawyer declined to comment. Trotta is a registered Republican, according to state records. His social media posts, from an account last active in 2020, supported Trump and criticized Democrats.A York City Police Department spokesperson, Captain Daniel Lentz, said he didn't believe Trotta's attack was \"politically motivated\" because Trotta previously pleaded guilty to two cases of harassment in which he struck random people. The police report, however, did not include statements from Vandersloot and Almoney, who both said they believed the attack was political. Lentz said he didn't know why the police didn't record their accounts.NEW ISSUES, NEW VIOLENCEThere's no government data on political violence, though several universities and private research groups track it in various ways, typically using databases built on news accounts. Some include random hate crimes; others, including Reuters, do not. Most have not released comprehensive data since 2020.The 300 cases identified by Reuters were culled from records on thousands of violent crimes since the 2021 Capitol attack. Most of that data was captured initially by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, a global violence-tracking project run by a nonpartisan research group in Wisconsin. Reporters identified additional cases using news databases, court filings and police reports obtained through public records requests.Some of the cases don't break down along traditional partisan lines, including those linked to disputes over the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.That was the case last month when Caleb Gannon, a pro-Palestinian critic of U.S. government support for Israel, began heckling a pro-Israel rally in Newton, Massachusetts. Cell phone video shows Gannon shouting, \"You're supporting genocide!\" before running into the crowd and tackling Scott Hayes, a fervent backer of Israel.Earlier this year, Hayes, an Iraq War veteran, posted a photo on social media of a handgun with a Star of David pendant and the message \"Hey Jew Haters. Bring it.\" As they wrestled on the ground, Hayes shot Gannon in the abdomen.Hayes, 47, is awaiting trial after pleading not guilty to assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. The county prosecutor has said an assault and battery charge also will be pursued against Gannon, 31, who remains hospitalized. Hayes' lawyer said he will argue self-defense but declined further comment.Other cases are directly linked to the election.On Sept. 26, a Michigan man was arrested for assaulting a U.S. Postal Service worker who delivered a Harris campaign mailer to his house. The postal worker was in her truck when Russell Valleau, 61, approached on a bike, yelling that he \"did not want that 'Black bitch' in his mailbox,\" according to police records and a statement from the Oakland County prosecutor.When the postal worker, who is Black, told Valleau to back away, he called her a \"Black bitch\" and lunged at her with a knife, according to her account to the Farmington Hills Police Department. She sprayed him with dog repellent, and he retreated. \"I just had a man come to me with a knife and try to stab me,\" she said moments later in a call to police, according to a recording obtained through a records request. \"I sprayed him.\"Police reported finding Valleau lying in a nearby yard, apparently intoxicated and suffering the effects of chemical repellant. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of assault and battery and ethnic intimidation. His lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.In another case this summer, four white men in a pick-up truck rolled up to a rural home in coastal North Carolina and asked three Black teens in the yard \"if they liked Donald Trump,\" according to a report from the Pasquotank County Sheriff's Office. When the youths said, \"No,\" the report said, the men opened fired with a BB gun, hitting one youth in the leg and another in the buttocks. The shots also broke windows on the house, a shed and a car out front.The truck drove off. Police are investigating the case as an assault with a deadly weapon and have no suspects. The children suffered minor injuries and declined medical treatment.Christian Gilyard, the youths' father, said political tensions have become more pronounced since the contested 2020 election, but he never expected problems in his own neighborhood. \"It's shocking,\" he said, \"that something like this would happen here.\"(Peter Eisler reported from Washington.

    "title": "Could Trump undermine the vote again? Harris's legal team says it's not worried.",
    "content": "The vice president's campaign is projecting calm, even as outside experts warn that the risk of a chaotic aftermath to the election is real.Former president Donald Trump and his allies have filed hundreds of lawsuits, with more to come, seeking to tighten voting rules or disqualify voters. Security experts have gamed out how to restore order quickly if unrest at polling locations shuts down voting for hours on end. Election administrators in several states have purchased panic buttons for their poll workers to use in the event of violence.Despite all of that, Vice President Kamala Harris's legal team claims they are sure that this year's presidential election will be secure, fair and free -- if not entirely without problems.Over multiple interviews with the campaign's top legal advisers, the Harris campaign projected confidence that the 2024 presidential election will ultimately succeed in delivering a clear winner, with eligible voters able to cast ballots, the ballots being properly tabulated and Congress certifying the electoral college count on Jan. 6, 2025.\"There's not an awful lot that does keep me up at night,\" said Eric Holder, the former U.S. attorney general, who helped oversee the vetting process for Harris's running mate. \"We found that the 2020 election was the most secure election in American history. And I think there's a reason to expect that this will be the same.\"Four years ago, Trump responded to his loss to Joe Biden by claiming without basis that fraud had marred the results, launching a multistate effort to overturn the vote and inciting a mob to assault the Capitol. This year, he has repeatedly said he believes the only way he can lose is if Democrats cheat while maintaining that his opponents have already interfered with the election. He has declined to pledge to respect the outcome.In interviews, several of Harris's top attorneys -- the campaign now has hundreds of lawyers -- said their years-long preparations have positioned them to be ready should Trump again try to invalidate the results. To bolster their belief, they cite recent court victories, including two key wins in Georgia and another in North Carolina last week that they said prove their strategy is working. The campaign made the lawyers available to speak about their preparations in an effort to reassure voters, particularly anxious Democrats, that they are ready for any eventuality.The real test, they said, will come after Nov. 5, when, if Harris wins, they say Trump and his allies will launch more litigation, sow mistrust and perhaps even plant the seeds for civil unrest.\"No matter what level of the election, whether presidential or Senate or House, Republicans are going to say, if they lose, that they were cheated,\" said Marc Elias, a longtime Democratic election lawyer leading the recount strategy for the Harris team. \"Donald Trump will never concede.\"\"Against that,\" he added, \"I will tell you we have been preparing for every eventuality.\"Elias said the Harris legal team has prepared for lawsuits seeking to halt voting on Election Day, block the counting of provisional ballots or discard mail ballots arriving after Nov. 5, among other scenarios.Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt did not directly answer a request for a response to the Harris team's claims. \"President Trump has been very clear,\" she said in an email. \"We must have free and fair elections.\"A Republican National Committee spokeswoman said the GOP's election protection program is robust and has also racked up successes so far this year. Among other things, the party has recruited 5,000 volunteer lawyers across the country to monitor elections, according to spokeswoman Claire Zunk.\"Our unprecedented election integrity operation is committed to defending the law and protecting every legal vote,\" Zunk said. \"We have stopped Democrat schemes to dismantle election safeguards and will continue to fight for a fair and transparent election for all Americans.\"As early voting gets underway across the country, Harris has increasingly emphasized the threat she says Trump poses to American democracy. Harris campaigned last week in Washington Crossing, Pa., with a handful of prominent Republicans who have endorsed her candidacy, as she hammered the former president for his effort to overturn the 2020 election.\"This is a profound difference between Donald Trump and me -- he who violated the oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States and, make no mistake, he who, if given the chance, will violate it again,\" Harris said. \"Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, and he refused to accept the will of the people and the results of a free and fair election.\"Democrats and Republicans have sparred for years over whether to loosen or tighten voting access, with Democrats pushing for less restrictive policies and Republicans insisting that more stringent rules are needed to prevent fraud. Those battles have continued in the lead-up to the election, with GOP lawsuits pushing to remove voters from state rolls, invalidate mail-in votes and apply greater scrutiny to overseas ballots.The Harris campaign argued in an internal strategy memo obtained by The Washington Post that the GOP effort to restrict access aligns with the party's political motives because Trump thinks has a better shot at winning if Republicans can make it harder for certain people to vote, such as those who choose to cast ballots by mail.\"Democrats are running an aggressive, proactive legal strategy to protect your right to vote and have that vote count,\" the memo states. \"We have been planning for four years to win not only at the ballot box but also in court, and to ensure another free and fair election.\"In 2020, Trump allies convened in numerous states he lost to falsely sign certifications that he had won. Elias said he is less worried about that happening now because so many of the lawyers and operatives who participated in that scheme have been indicted or are under ethics investigations.He's also less worried about violence on Jan. 6, 2025, when Congress will convene to certify a final count of the electoral college. Federal law was changed after the violent attack on the Capitol in 2021 to make it harder to challenge valid electoral votes.Other possible avenues for undermining the results have also fallen away. In Georgia last week, a state judge blocked a new rule approved by the pro-Trump state election board that would have required a hand-count of the number of ballots at every precinct. Critics said the requirement threatened to upend the election by delaying the reporting of results.The same judge also ruled that county election boards do not have the discretion to withhold certification of results, a defeat for Trump allies who had sought to empower local leaders to hold up the outcome of the vote.Also last week, a North Carolina judge dismissed a case from state and national Republican leaders seeking to remove more than 200,000 voters from the rolls. The GOP claimed in the suit that the voters had not provided proper documentation when they registered, but offered no evidence that any of them were ineligible to vote.The plans for a robust legal strategy has been years in the making, predating Biden's withdrawal from the race and Harris's ascension to the nomination.A big moment came shortly after Biden launched his reelection campaign last April, when Dana Remus, a senior adviser and outside counsel to the campaign, convened a meeting with the legal team to plot strategy. A particular focus was how to plan for the days after Election Day.The team also prioritized building out a network of lawyers based in battleground states, spending the summer creating \"state pods\" to work in coordination with the national lawyers.\"I would say the overriding theme of our strategy is prepare, prepare, prepare,\" Remus said in an interview. \"We've been doing it for four years, and that is a difference from the past. You typically spin up the voter protection and election protection aspect of a campaign as the campaign spins up in the year, 18 months before an election, and we have been building since 2020.\"The team now has more than 400 lawyers, including volunteers, who are specifically focused on post-election planning. The campaign has drafted more than 500 pleadings related to potential Election Day and post-election litigation, covering a wide range of topics, including the Trump campaign's legal strategy, governors and state legislatures' emergency powers and the role of electors and Congress in final certification.\"He tried it in '20 and we were prepared,\" Pat Moore, senior counsel on the Harris campaign, said of Trump. \"We expect that he's going to try it in '24, and we'll be even more prepared. We understand the arguments that they're likely to make, and we have literally thousands of papers of draft pleadings ready to go for when they are made. So, is it typical? Of course not. Trump is atypical, but he is predictable.\"Plenty of outside groups are using darker language to broadcast the risks they see this election season. The University of Pennsylvania's Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law, for instance, convened a gathering last week of senior retired military leaders and state and local officials to issue what they called a \"stark warning\" that Americans must take seriously the risk of violence or disruption.The group conducted a variety of tabletop exercises, including one simulation where allegations of election irregularities result in protests that spiral out of control, requiring local officials to close polls to restore order. The exercise revealed, the experts said, that state and local officials are not as prepared as they must be for such a crisis.\"We think there's a real possibility of civil unrest,\" said Mickey Edwards, a former Republican member of Congress from Oklahoma who participated in the exercises. \"The question is how we deal with it.\"Edwards said disinformation could fuel anger and even violence. His biggest fear, he said, is that the certification of results is delayed.\"The greatest danger here is that we will not be able to actually count and certify the results of the elections so that the administration of whoever wins the presidency can take place,\" he said.Donald Verrilli, a former U.S. solicitor general who advises the Harris campaign, conceded that the outside angst is real. But it's not new, he said, and it doesn't mean catastrophe is coming.\"Those kinds of tabletop exercises and anxiety were all present in 2020,\" he said. \"We met the moment and we're ready to meet the moment here too.\"Emily Guskin contributed to this report.",

    "title": "Harris, Trump in tight race as swing states remain in play before US election",
    "content": "As the 2024 US presidential election approaches, Vice President Kamala Harris holds a narrow lead over former President Donald Trump in national polling averages.With election day set for Nov. 5, Harris is polling at 48.2%, while Trump follows closely at 46.4%, according to recent data from ABC News and 538.However, the national numbers do not tell the full story. The race remains fiercely competitive in key battleground states, where the election will likely be decided.Both candidates are locked in a virtual tie in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.Trump, who won these states in 2016 but lost them in 2020, hopes to reclaim them, while Harris aims to maintain her slim edge.Pennsylvania, with the highest number of electoral votes among the swing states, is critical for both campaigns. With 19 electoral votes, Harris and Trump are in a statistical tie in Pennsylvania, with Trump slightly ahead at 47.9% to Harris's 47.5%. Winning this state could heavily tilt the election in either candidate's favor.Michigan, which flipped back to the Democrats in 2020 after Trump's 2016 win, is another key state Harris needs to retain. With 15 electoral votes, Harris holds a narrow lead, polling at 47.4% compared to Trump's 47.2%.Wisconsin has been a battleground since 2016, and both candidates are vying to win this pivotal Midwest state. With 10 electoral votes, Harris is ahead in Wisconsin, with 47.8% compared to Trump's 47.6%.Arizona remains one of the tightest contests, with 11 electoral votes. The state, which voted for Biden in 2020, will be a significant bellwether for both parties, with Trump ahead at 48.6%, while Harris at 46.7%.After flipping blue in 2020, Georgia has become a critical state for Democrats to defend in 2024. With 16 electoral votes, Trump has a slim advantage in Georgia, leading with 48.7% to Harris's 46.9%.North Carolina remains a battleground, having leaned towards Republicans in recent cycles, but Democrats are hopeful to make gains this year. With 16 electoral votes, Trump holds a narrow lead in North Carolina at 48%, with Harris polling at 47.5%.With 6 electoral votes, Harris is slightly ahead in Nevada, with 47.6% compared to Trump's 47.1%. This small but crucial swing state remains a key target for both campaigns as they compete for its electoral votes.The tight margins underscore the unpredictability of the race, with both candidates vying for the 270 electoral votes needed to secure the presidency.Though Harris has seen a steady lead since Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race in July, the contest remains too close to call in crucial swing states.If Trump holds onto his leads in Georgia, Arizona, and North Carolina, while flipping Pennsylvania, he could secure the 270 electoral votes needed for victory. Conversely, if Harris can maintain her lead in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Nevada, while regaining ground in Pennsylvania, she would be on course to become the nation's first woman president.With swing states holding the balance, the 2024 election is shaping up to be another closely contested race, with both candidates battling for every vote in the final days before Nov. 5.",

    "title": "2nd District candidate Corkery stresses women's health care rights, education",
    "content": "Cedar Falls Democrat Sarah Corkery realizes she has an uphill battle.The first-time candidate and two-time breast cancer survivor stepped up to run for Northeast Iowa's 2nd Congressional District seat because Democrats were \"desperately looking for someone\" to run against Republican incumbent Ashley Hinson, she said.Hinson, a former state lawmaker and former KCRG-TV news anchor who lives in Marion, is seeking re-election to a third term. She won re-election last year to a second term by 8 percentage points against Democratic former state lawmaker Liz Mathis of Hiawatha. Hinson unseated first-term Democratic U.S. Rep. Abby Finkenauer in 2020.Jody Puffett, 59, of Delhi, is running unaffiliated with a political party and will appear on the Nov. 5 ballot alongside Corkery and Hinson.Corkery said she had recently quit her job to start her own business, and felt the timing was right to challenge the well-funded, two-term incumbent in a district that favors Republicans.People are also reading...

And it's no secret that (the Iowa Democratic Party) had asked other people to consider this race, \" Corkery said. \"... I believe nobody wanted to be the Liz Mathis palate cleanser -- that if Liz Mathis could not get this done, it was no chance. So I was willing to take that chance and do this, even knowing we wouldn't get help (from the state and national party) and that it would be a very hard job. Because I thought, how many times in your life are you the best candidate that's willing to do it? So to me, it was a great opportunity.\"Corkery said she was spurred to run for the U.S. House seat after Hinson declined initially to sign on as a co-sponsor to bipartisan legislation introduced by Iowa GOP U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst that would give eligible metastatic breast cancer patients access to support and medical care years sooner than current law allows.The bill would waive the five-month waiting period for Social Security Disability Insurance and the 24-month waiting period for Medicare benefits for eligible individuals with metastatic breast cancer.Corkery said the legislation would do away with unnecessary waiting periods and ensure patients get the care they need.Hinson's said she is supportive of the bill and has since signed on as a co-sponsor.Corkery also cited Hinson's votes against the bipartisan infrastructure law and a U.S. House bill that would have capped the cost of insulin for all Americans at $35.\"Iowans deserve better than a representative who puts partisan politics over our health care needs,\" Corkery said.Hinson has said government price controls ultimately will raise premiums for Americans. Instead, she said she favors another bill with several bipartisan provisions that would cap out-of-pocket insulin costs at for seniors on Medicare Part D, allow high-deductible plans to cover insulin costs before the deductible kicks in, increase transparency for patients and promote innovation.Hinson said she opposed the infrastructure bill because of its large price tag, and has advocated for and helped secure funding for targeted infrastructure updates and various projects in the district.Corkery has spent over 25 years as a marketing professional and now operates a small creative branding firm with her husband, Chris.She has focused her campaign on women's health care rights and public education. She regularly attacks Hinson for supporting legislation limiting women's ability to receive an abortion.Corkery often highlights her business experience and personal resilience raising a child with a disability and surviving breast cancer. She stressed the importance of authenticity and the need for election reform to make politics more accessible.\"Abby Finkenauer only lasted one term because, you know, she had a reputation for not being available,\" Corkery said. \"So this district doesn't like incumbents who are not productive. I think that is why I'm the right candidate. I have proved in business and in personal life I can do hard things, like raise a child with a disability and help raise $1 million for a park to accommodate them. That's not easy to do. So doing hard things is what I do.\"The districtIowa's 2nd Congressional District encompasses 22 counties in Northeast Iowa, including Cedar Rapids, Waterloo, Cedar Falls and Dubuque. The race is expected to be less competitive than Iowa's 1st and 3rd districts, which are also on the Nov. 5 ballot.A Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll showed in September more likely Iowa voters preferred a Republican candidate over a Democrat in three of the state's four congressional districts, including the 2nd District.The independent, nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates Iowa's 2nd District as a \"solid Republican\" R+4 district, meaning that in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, voters in the district supported Republican candidates an average of about 4 points more than the nation did as a whole.The latest figures from the Iowa Secretary of State's Office show there are nearly 150,000 active registered Republican voters, more than 127,000 active registered Democrats, nearly 130,000 active no-party voters, and 2,400 active registered Libertarians in the district.Hinson has a large fundraising advantage over Corkery. National Democrats have not targeted the race in the same way they have the 1st and 3rd districts, leaving Corkery with little outside support.Corkery points to the latest Iowa Poll that suggests Vice President Kamala Harris has significantly narrowed the presidential race in Iowa, cutting Republican former President Donald Trump's lead to 4 points.Corkery said she has witnessed a surge of enthusiasm since Harris took over the top of the Democratic ticket. It's a significant shift she said will help boost her campaign -- especially with an independent candidate on the ballot she's hoping will siphon votes from Hinson.During a debate this month, Corkery called for Republicans who disagree with Hinson's policies and voting record to look at the independent's campaign and consider supporting her.Asked after the debate about that strategy, Corkery told reporters, \"It's just a numbers game, right?\" and \"if Jody takes 5% or 10% away from Ashley, we win. I'm not being sneaky. Jody Puffett is a lifelong Republican, and she did enter this race because of (Hinson's support of aid to) Ukraine. So if those out there really feel the same, I want them to look at Jody Puffett.\"The economyCorkery said she supports Harris' plans to build an \"opportunity economy,\" including expanding the child tax credit and housing assistance for first-time homebuyers, providing a $50,000 tax deduction for small-business startups, lowering the cost of prescription drugs and implementing a federal ban on price gouging by food suppliers.Corkery, during last week's lone debate between her and Hinson, said she supports letting the 2017 Trump-era tax cuts expire, saying that it disproportionately favors wealthy Americans. Hinson said her opponent \"said the quiet part out loud here,\" and that Democrats support increasing taxes across all income levels.ImmigrationCorkery said she supports a bipartisan plan in the U.S. Senate to secure the border that was thwarted by Donald Trump, the Republican former president seeking another term in the White House, and his supporters. The deal called for increased funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention beds, Border Patrol agents, asylum officers and immigration judges. It would reinforce new restrictions on migrants seeking asylum, and make other reforms.She said she supports making it more difficult to gain asylum in the United States and giving presidents more authority to close the Southern border.\"Extreme conservative Republicans blocked that bill so that Trump would not get a win before the election,\" Corkery said at the debate. \"People are tired of these politics. If it's a true problem and you have the solution in your hands, we need to get it done.\"She added that she opposes Trump's proposal to use the military and local law enforcement to enact the largest deportation of undocumented immigrants in U.S. history. Corkery, echoing economists and immigrant advocates, said mass deportation would threaten the economy and disrupt the food supply chain, which is reliant on many forms of migrant labor.Corkery said Hinson and Republicans are \"fear mongering\" on the issue of immigration instead of focusing on expanding and improving the legal immigration system.Abortion and IVFCorkery has made restoring access to abortion care a priority if elected, and said the decision to terminate a pregnancy should be a conversation \"between a person and a doctor,\" with no defined cutoff point for when abortions become illegal.\"This is not a flippant conversation, and that's what it's become when we focus on one metric,\" she said. \"... And nobody should also tell you that the fetus you carry has more rights than you do. That's just wrong.\"Corkery spoke about her experience with pregnancy complications when she and her son almost died at 38 weeks of gestation. She said she does not believe focusing on how many weeks into a pregnancy abortions should become illegal is productive, as it does not reflect the reasons why women sometimes receive late-term abortions.\"If you say a number of weeks, then your next question should be, 'Is the mother's life at risk? Is there a fetal anomaly that makes this incompatible with life?'\" Corkery said during the debate.Corkery has attacked Hinson for cosponsoring the Life at Conception Act, which would establish legal protections for fetuses and embryos at \"the moment of fertilization,\" and guarantee a \"right to life\" for every human being.While the bill -- which never made it to the House floor -- does not specifically mention abortion, critics say it would undoubtedly restrict the medical procedure as well as in vitro fertilization. The bill does not spell out protections for fertility treatments or exceptions for cases involving rape, incest or to save the life of the mother.\"She either doesn't understand what she signed or she is playing politics with women's lives,\" Corkery said during the debate.Hinson said she would not vote for the bill as it's currently written, or any other piece of legislation, without those exceptions and a carve out for IVF. She said she signed onto the legislation to \"support a culture of life in Washington, D.C.\"Hinson condemned Corkery for not specifying a cutoff point for when abortion should become illegal, calling the position extreme.Foreign policyAsked if she supports the United States sending weaponry and humanitarian aid and personnel to Israel, Corkery said \"it needs to be looked at.\" She said it's crucial to ensure aid reaches innocent people, including women and children, and that finding a two-state solution is essential.\"But should we send aid? Yes. Making sure people can defend themselves and making sure it's going toward women and children and innocent lives, yes,\" Corkery said at the debate.Corkery said she also supports U.S. aid to Ukraine. \"We need to stand up with our allies\" and support democracy, she said.BipartisanshipCorkery said she's grown frustrated with Hinson's voting record, calling it partisan, and that it shows that she's more interested in catering to special interests than looking out for Iowans.\"I'll work with people who are Republicans or Democrats, or anybody who's interested in helping Iowans improve their lives,\" Corkery said. \"... Americans are tired of (gridlock in Congress). They just want progress. ... What we need to do is start finding people who are willing to work together.\"Hinson's campaign has claimed Corkery would be a \"rubber-stamp\" of Harris' agenda the campaign asserts has fueled inflation, an open border and global instability that has put Americans in danger.Corkery has denied the assertion. She said, if elected, she will \"vote with my convictions ... and what's best for Iowa.\"Who is Sarah Corkery?Age: 49Party: DemocratTown of residence: Cedar FallsOccupation: Co-owner and chief marketing officer of Corkery & Corkery, a creative branding firm she operates with her husband, Chris.Political experience: First-time candidateCampaign website: corkeryforcongress.comEconomic factors and currency volatility in the 2024 US presidential election Economic factors and currency volatility in the 2024 US presidential election Who is Sarah Corkery?Age: 49Party: DemocratTown of residence: Cedar FallsOccupation: Co-owner and chief marketing officer of Corkery & Corkery, a creative branding firm she operates with her husband, Chris.Political experience: First-time candidateCampaign website: corkeryforcongress.com0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0Get Government & Politics updates in your inbox!Stay up-to-date on the latest in local and national government and political topics with our newsletter.Sign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.",

Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, has made access to abortion central to her campaign.Republican rival former President Donald Trump has bragged about appointing three of the conservative justices who made the ruling but has since said abortion laws should be determined by U.S. states, stopping short of proposing a national ban that could imperil his chances with swing voters in the November election.",

    "title": "Coffee, squats and a 'magic wall': How CNN's John King will get through Election Day 2024",
    "content": "How many cups of coffee do you need to get through election night?\"I would run out of fingers,\" says CNN anchor and chief correspondent John King. \"I start early in the morning, and I just keep going.\"While copious amounts of black coffee or espresso will keep King going through Election Day and night, the CNN Anchor and Chief National Correspondent admits it's actually the adrenaline that powers him through the grind and keeps him awake for hours at stretch.\"Let's just be honest, anyone who does this for a living (will say) the adrenaline kicks in,\" King tells USA TODAY over video call from his home. \"Yes, I drink a lot of coffee, probably too much coffee during election week, but it's also just adrenaline. This is this is what I do. This is my passion.\"While adrenaline, passion and a little bit of \"fun\" get King through election coverage, the veteran journalist is well aware of the responsibilities that come with the job.\"I take it on myself (the responsibility), especially in this age where people are constantly questioning the integrity of our elections and the integrity of our news media,\" King says. \"That raises the preparation bar for me, and it makes me constantly think about not only am I prepared, but how do I communicate? There are people out there who don't trust you, or people on the sidelines trying to get them not to trust you. The importance of clarity in communication and trust in your brand, both my personal brand, and then the broader CNN brand is just critical.\"In the months leading up to the election, King has been doing it all. The CNN anchor stepped away from his role as the anchor of \"Inside Politics,\" in April 2023, handing the torch to Dana Bash, to \"take on a new role focused on voters in battleground states during the 2024 presidential election,\" according to an April 2023 CNN news release.King tells USA TODAY that he's been on ground and traveling across the country for the last 15 months and will continue to do so up until the week before the election.\"Study, prepare (and) be ready physically,\" King adds. \"Because it's not going to be one night, it's not going to be one long day, it's all the work up to the election. In 2024, we know at least roughly what's coming, and so you prepare for it. And again, that's a mix of journalism, work and studying, and a mix of making sure that you're in as good a form as you can be when it comes to being on TV time.\"The weekend before the election, however, he plans to spend with his 13-year-old son, who he shares with Bash.With such a hectic schedule, how does King, who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2008, manage?\"MS is a challenge, but everybody has challenges,\" King says. \"I take pride in it. It's my life. It's part of my challenge. I'm actually motivated by it in a strange way. It just makes me work harder. It makes me think more. The things that most trigger my MS, sometimes (are) random, but the normal triggers are heat and stress and intense physical strain. And they all come together in election week.\"King shares he makes sure he exercises daily, even if that means waking up at the crack of dawn to hit the hotel gym before starting the work day, keeping a check on his diet and always keeping his meds stocked up wherever he goes.\"It's a range, and it depends,\" says King. \"I'm very, very lucky of those who have MS. I'm on the lucky spectrum (but) it's with me every day. It bothers me every day, it challenges me every day, but I'm able to function, and that's part of my routine.\"The anchor explained that it's usually his thighs that are most affected by MS and he \"can't feel from my thighs down.\"\"I haven't felt from the thighs down since Bill Clinton was President,\" he jokes.To maintain good shape and ensure his body can endure the physical stress that comes with covering the election, King says he trains on the treadmill besides incorporating \"more leg work\" such as squats and light-medium weights. While on the road, King says he does a lot of outdoor walking if the weather's nice and seeing \"all over these great places we visit.\"\"Ask me after the election if I did the right thing or if I screwed myself up,\" King jokes.While King prepares, his famous \"magic wall\" that became a celebrity on social media during the last election cycle \"is at the beach having a couple of nice, fun frozen drinks just to rest up and relax.\"\"It'll fly back soon, and it'll be ready,\" King jokes. \"I always joke (that) sometimes I do treat it as a person.

    "title": "Coffee, squats and a 'magic wall': How CNN's John King will get through Election Day 2024",
    "content": "How many cups of coffee do you need to get through election night?\"I would run out of fingers,\" says CNN anchor and chief correspondent John King. \"I start early in the morning, and I just keep going.\"While copious amounts of black coffee or espresso will keep King going through Election Day and night, the CNN Anchor and Chief National Correspondent admits it's actually the adrenaline that powers him through the grind and keeps him awake for hours at stretch.\"Let's just be honest, anyone who does this for a living (will say) the adrenaline kicks in,\" King tells USA TODAY over video call from his home. \"Yes, I drink a lot of coffee, probably too much coffee during election week, but it's also just adrenaline. This is this is what I do. This is my passion.\"Preparing for the election: 'It's not going to be one night'While adrenaline, passion and a little bit of \"fun\" get King through election coverage, the veteran journalist is well aware of the responsibilities that come with the job.\"I take it on myself (the responsibility), especially in this age where people are constantly questioning the integrity of our elections and the integrity of our news media,\" King says. \"That raises the preparation bar for me, and it makes me constantly think about not only am I prepared, but how do I communicate? There are people out there who don't trust you, or people on the sidelines trying to get them not to trust you. The importance of clarity in communication and trust in your brand, both my personal brand, and then the broader CNN brand is just critical.\"In the months leading up to the election, King has been doing it all. The CNN anchor stepped away from his role as the anchor of \"Inside Politics,\" in April 2023, handing the torch to Dana Bash, to \"take on a new role focused on voters in battleground states during the 2024 presidential election,\" according to an April 2023 CNN news release.King tells USA TODAY that he's been on ground and traveling across the country for the last 15 months and will continue to do so up until the week before the election.\"Study, prepare (and) be ready physically,\" King adds. \"Because it's not going to be one night, it's not going to be one long day, it's all the work up to the election. In 2024, we know at least roughly what's coming, and so you prepare for it. And again, that's a mix of journalism, work and studying, and a mix of making sure that you're in as good a form as you can be when it comes to being on TV time.\"The weekend before the election, however, he plans to spend with his 13-year-old son, who he shares with Bash.\"MS is a challenge, but everybody has challenges,\" King says. \"I take pride in it. It's my life. It's part of my challenge. I'm actually motivated by it in a strange way. It just makes me work harder. It makes me think more. The things that most trigger my MS, sometimes (are) random, but the normal triggers are heat and stress and intense physical strain. And they all come together in election week.\"King shares he makes sure he exercises daily, even if that means waking up at the crack of dawn to hit the hotel gym before starting the work day, keeping a check on his diet and always keeping his meds stocked up wherever he goes.\"It's a range, and it depends,\" says King. \"I'm very, very lucky of those who have MS. I'm on the lucky spectrum (but) it's with me every day. It bothers me every day, it challenges me every day, but I'm able to function, and that's part of my routine.\"The anchor explained that it's usually his thighs that are most affected by MS and he \"can't feel from my thighs down.\"\"I haven't felt from the thighs down since Bill Clinton was President,\" he jokes.To maintain good shape and ensure his body can endure the physical stress that comes with covering the election, King says he trains on the treadmill besides incorporating \"more leg work\" such as squats and light-medium weights. While on the road, King says he does a lot of outdoor walking if the weather's nice and seeing \"all over these great places we visit.\"\"Ask me after the election if I did the right thing or if I screwed myself up,\" King jokes.'Magic wall' prepares for the electionWhile King prepares, his famous \"magic wall\" that became a celebrity on social media during the last election cycle \"is at the beach having a couple of nice, fun frozen drinks just to rest up and relax.\"\"It'll fly back soon, and it'll be ready,\" King jokes. \"I always joke (that) sometimes I do treat it as a person.

    "content": "By Ahmed AbouleneinWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration is proposing a rule that would provide women with private insurance access to over-the-counter birth control pills and other contraceptives at no cost, the White House said on Monday.The rule, which expands a federal mandate requiring health insurers to cover preventative care services at no cost to patients under the Affordable Care Act, is being proposed by the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and the Treasury and would come into effect in 2025 if finalized.\"This rule, once finalized, will expand contraception coverage for 52 million women of reproductive age with private health insurance,\" White House Gender Policy Council Director Jennifer Klein said during a briefing.\"For the first time ever, women would be able to obtain over-the-counter contraception without a prescription at no additional cost, and health plans would have to cover even more prescribed contraceptives without cost sharing,\" she said.Perrigo Co's Opill is currently the only daily birth control pill approved for sale without a prescription by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but the proposed rule covers other forms of over-the-counter contraceptives, including emergency contraception such as morning after pill Plan B, spermicides, birth control sponges, and condoms.The rule will also require that health plans cover all FDA-approved contraceptive drugs and some devices, including IUDs, without cost sharing in many cases.The rule will also require health plans to cover every FDA-approved contraceptive drug or drug-led combination product, such as IUDs, without cost sharing unless the plan also covers a therapeutic equivalent without cost sharing, and would require plans to disclose that OTC contraceptives are covered with cost sharing or a prescription.The proposal comes just two weeks before the 2024 presidential election, in which abortion rights has been a key issue following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v Wade in 2022. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, has made access to abortion central to her campaign.Republican rival former President Donald Trump has bragged about appointing three of the conservative justices who made the ruling but has since said abortion laws should be determined by U.S. states, stopping short of proposing a national ban that could imperil his chances with swing voters in the November election.(Reporting by Ahmed Aboulenein; Editing by Marguerita Choy)",

    "content": "Tesla Inc. and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's daily $1 million PAC giveaway has come under scrutiny, with billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban questioning its legality.What Happened: On Saturday, Musk announced at a town hall that America PAC, a pro-Donald Trump super PAC founded by the tech mogul, will be giving away $1 million daily to a person in swing states who has signed his petition.The online petition urges individuals to show their support for the First and Second Amendments, which protect freedom of speech and the right to bear arms.In response, Cuban took to X, formerly Twitter, and expressed doubts about its legality. \"I'm pretty sure that while it may or may not violate voting laws, it may violate gaming laws in Pennsylvania.\"See Also: Trump Supporter Flies Banner Over Taylor Swift's Miami Concert: 'Trump 2024 - Ready For It, Cat Lady? MAGA!'However, Cuban later said he'd defer to the lawyers in this case when users pointed out that laws around sweepstakes are more relevant in this matter.Following Cuban's comments, one user criticized the \"Shark Tank\" star's stance, accusing him of swindling Yahoo in the '90s for a \"functionally useless company.\"Musk agreed with the user's comment, highlighting the 1999 deal when Yahoo! acquired Cuban's Broadcast.com for $5.7 billion.Later that year, Cuban sold most of the Yahoo! shares acquired during the deal, becoming a billionaire at 41. His choice to sell to Yahoo! proved wise, as the internet giant completely shut down Broadcast.com just three years later following the dot-com bubble burst.America PAC and Cuban did not immediately respond to Benzinga's request for comments.Why It Matters: Cuban and Musk are currently at odds over their political differences and opposing views on Trump, particularly as the 2024 presidential election approaches.Musk has been openly campaigning for Trump, using social media to promote his views and claims of election fraud, while Cuban has backed Vice President Kamala Harris.Previously, Cuban cautioned Musk about his strong support for Trump, pointing out that the Tesla CEO may be mistaken about the former president's supposed loyalty. \"At the point you need him the most, you will find out what so many before you have learned, his loyalty is only to himself.\"Read Next:Kamala Harris Repeats Promise To Get Rid Of 'Unnecessary Degree Requirements' -- 'I Will Challenge The Private Sector To Do The Same'Disclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Photos courtesy: ShutterstockMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs",

    "title": "Trump's Bro-Whispering Could Cost Democrats Too Many Young Men",
    "content": "Generation Z is poised to flex its growing political muscle in the 2024 presidential election, and in my surveys and focus groups with these voters, I'm seeing the strong potential for a turning point in American political alignment. Unlike other recent Republican presidential nominees, Donald Trump is making young men a central focus of his campaign. If effective, his effort could peel enough away from the Democratic Party to transform the country's electoral math for years to come.Recent data from the Harvard Youth Poll, a national survey I oversee for the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics, reveals an increasing political rift between young men and women under 30, two groups critical to Democrats' success in recent elections. Almost exactly equal shares of young men and young women say they will definitely vote in this election or have already done so. But since the spring of 2020, the share of young men identifying as registered Democrats has dropped by seven percentage points, while those identifying as Republicans have increased by seven points -- a net shift of 14 points in just four years. Young women, during the same period, shifted two points away from the Republicans.Take one young Pittsburgh man I met in a recent focus group. A college graduate working part-time as a bartender, he felt weighed down by hopelessness, adrift in a country where rising costs, stagnant wages and lack of affordable housing have made even the modest ambitions of other generations feel out of reach for him. \"Hope is great,\" he told me, \"but I see nothing for the future.\"The young man's experience reflects a broader crisis of confidence and purpose, rooted in economic insecurity and social disconnection. The Covid pandemic exacerbated the alienation, with many first-time voters spending thousands of hours isolated and online in their formative years.While these struggles affect the whole country, they weigh especially on young men of all educational, racial and ethnic backgrounds. Nearly three-quarters of Gen Z men report feeling regularly stressed by an uncertain future, stirring painful memories of the Great Recession they witnessed as children. These feelings erode self-esteem and diminish their interest in personal relationships and long-term planning, leading many to describe their future as \"bleak,\" \"unclear\" and \"scary.\"Today's young men are lonelier than ever and have inherited a world rife with skepticism toward the institutions designed to promote and defend American ideals. Men under 30 are nearly twice as likely to be single as women their same age; Gen Z men are less likely to enroll in college or the work force than previous generations. They have higher rates of suicide and are less likely than their female peers to receive treatment for mental health maladies. Most young men in my polling say they fear for our country's future, and nearly half doubt their cohort's ability to meet our nation's coming challenges.Mr. Trump has tapped these anxieties by weaving a hypermasculine message of strength and defiance into his broader narrative that undermines confidence in democratic institutions. And it's working. Aware that boasting about \"killing\" Roe v. Wade drove away young women, Mr. Trump zeroed in on capturing a larger share of the young male vote. In four years, he cut what was once a 19-percentage point Democratic margin among registered young male voters (50 percent Mr. Biden, 31 percent Mr. Trump) roughly in half (48 percent Ms. Harris, 38 percent Mr. Trump) in our poll.His playbook? A master class in bro-whispering: championing crypto, securing the endorsement of Dave Portnoy -- the unapologetically offensive founder of Barstool Sports -- and giving U.F.C. President Dana White, who embodies the alpha-male archetype that appeals to many young men, a prime spot at the Republican National Convention. Mr. Trump has also cultivated relationships with simpatico comedians, pranksters, influencers and Silicon Valley billionaires like Elon Musk -- all while his team bombards podcasts and social media with misinformation and memes to rally his troops.This shift in support for Mr. Trump among men is neither organic nor unexpected. It's what happens when a well-coordinated political operation invests tens of millions of dollars to amplify Mr. Trump's narrative and weaken confidence in the party in power. Compared with when Mr. Trump ran in 2020, young male voters are now less likely to support government-backed climate change solutions (down 15 points, according to our poll) and affirmative action for qualified candidates (down eight points). They are more likely to question immigration policy (up 12 points), free trade (up 10 points) and whether government stimulus leads to economic growth (up seven points). They are also more likely to believe that religious values should play a more important role in government (up six points).Is this rightward drift among young men simply a short-lived, Trump-inspired episode or a more permanent transformation? The answer lies partly in Ms. Harris's ability to connect with and motivate young voters as the campaign nears its end.To be sure, she is doing better than Mr. Biden. Among men 18 to 29, her favorable rating is 44 percent, seven percentage points higher than Mr. Biden's and thirteen points higher than Mr. Trump's. While Mr. Biden's age and traditional political approach often created distance with younger voters, Ms. Harris's ability to engage across digital platforms and tap into youth culture sets her apart. Our polling also shows that while Mr. Trump has made significant inroads with young men, more still find Ms. Harris more relatable and competent. Mr. Trump still holds a narrow advantage on the economy, patriotism and strength, but Ms. Harris's connection with young men continues to grow, suggesting she has yet to reach her ceiling with this demographic.But to win more votes from young men, Ms. Harris must address their fears head-on and present a bold vision that speaks to their desire for purpose and strength. Of course, a clear economic vision that charts a pathway to financial independence is paramount, but it may not be enough to counter Mr. Trump's appeal on this issue in the closing days. Ms. Harris needs to go big.Here's one way. To reignite the hope of the emerging generation, Ms. Harris should make a sweeping national call to both military and civilian service -- name it the Generation Z Compact to Rebuild and Renew America. Such a plan would offer a sense of identity, community and patriotism, while providing economic stability and skill-building -- things many young men feel they are missing.Young Americans have consistently voiced support for national service programs, yet political action has yet to catch up. A 2021 survey revealed that 71 percent of adults under 25 were open to participating in a service program. Even more striking, a poll conducted last year found that about 75 percent of young people backed mandatory national service. These numbers tell a clear story: Our youth's appetite for civic engagement is strong and growing.From President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal Civilian Conservation Corps in 1933 to President John F. Kennedy's Peace Corps in 1961 to President Bill Clinton's AmeriCorps in 1993, national service has been a cornerstone of American resilience, transformation and progress. More than three decades after the last significant civic engagement initiative, Kamala Harris can frame national service as a pathway to rebuilding America's strength from within, addressing growing concerns about military recruitment and bridging political divides with a renewed sense of shared responsibility.Donald Trump has gained ground with Gen Z by systematically exploiting the fears and insecurities of young men, making them feel that their masculinity and future are under siege. Kamala Harris can counter that narrative by listening and recognizing their fears but also by offering something more profound: a vision of hope, strength and shared purpose.",

    "title": "Students not planning to vote cite dislike of candidates",
    "content": "For the last presidential election, 66 percent of college students made it to the polls.Only a handful of college students -- 8 percent of those surveyed by Inside Higher Ed and Generation Lab in late September -- say that they are not planning to vote in the 2024 presidential election.It's certainly an extreme underestimation of how many students will actually forgo casting a ballot this year; college student voter turnout in 2020 was 66 percent, a record. But of those who have made the choice not to vote this year, the majority indicated that that decision was tied to distrust and dislike of American politics and the politicians on the ballot this year.\"Those are the folks that no get-out-the-vote campaign is going to reach,\" said Anil Cacodcar, chair of the Harvard Public Opinion Project, which runs the largest poll of young Americans' political opinions. \"Seven out of 10 of them are saying they don't like the candidates, and they think their vote won't matter, and those aren't beliefs you can change in two weeks. Some of them are almost as committed to not voting as some folks are to voting for one or the other.\"Just over 1,000 college students across the United States responded to the Inside Higher Ed and Generation Lab survey, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent. Ninety-eight students said they weren't planning to vote while 15 percent said they were undecided.Of those who have decided not to vote, 26 percent said they dislike the candidates and 24 percent said they are \"turned off\" by politics when asked why they won't cast a ballot. A smaller number, 16 percent, say they feel their vote won't count, while only a minuscule 4 percent said they felt voting was too difficult.About 28 percent of respondents selected \"other\" when asked why they don't plan to vote, with some specifying they are not a citizen or are too young to vote. But others reiterated dislike of the current political system or a sense that voting was fruitless.As one student put it: \"My vote doesn't count, the candidates are trash.\"Some respondents seemed to feel not only that their individual vote wouldn't impact the election's results, but also that the country will likely go in the same direction regardless of who wins.\"I don't care who wins, and I don't think it'll make much of a difference anyway,\" one of the respondents wrote, while another said that the election amounts to \"picking lesser evils and tolerating two parties who seem to never get anything good done.\"Only one respondent expressed that they wanted to withhold their vote to protest the current presidential administration, despite the rise in youth activist campaigns aimed at protesting the Biden administration's handling of Israel's war in Gaza by refusing to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris.Cacodcar said that understanding the perspectives of students who don't intend to vote \"isn't really something, at this point, a campaign would want to study in depth. But people who are interested in long-term civic engagement would be interested in why people are not engaging this election.\"Young voters broadly may make the difference between a victory for Harris and a second Trump term, having played a significant role in electing Joe Biden in 2020. Plus, the large majority of respondents who said they are not voting identified as either Independents (41 percent) or registered with a third party (26 percent) -- another population both Trump and Harris are working to court.Past research has shown that many young people who abstain from voting do so because they don't feel voting is an effective way to make change, even when they are politically engaged, said Mindy Romero, founder and director of the Center for Inclusive Democracy at the University of Southern California. Campaigns are often ineffective at changing that perception, too.\"Candidates and campaigns are not reaching out to them in significant ways,\" she said. \"There's an information gap and an outreach gap for younger people versus older voters.\"Students who aren't planning to vote said that economy and reproductive rights were some of the most important issues that could affect their decision to cast a ballot this fall. That lines up with the overall survey found.Other political priorities of nonvoting students differ somewhat from the general student population. Perhaps unsurprisingly, a little over one in five nonvoters said they care about none of the issues, which are listed in the graph below, or do not care about politics.The only issues on which nonvoters cared about the same amount as all voters were the environment (20 percent among all respondents and 22 percent among nonvoters) and crime (17 percent for both categories). They also cared slightly more about the Israel-Hamas war, with 13 percent of nonvoters selecting it as a key issue versus just 11 percent of all student voters.But nonvoters were far less likely than their peers to say they care about the future of democracy (by a difference of 17 percentage points), racial justice and civil rights (a difference of 10 percentage points) and LGBTQIA+ issues (a difference of 10 percentage points).Cacodcar said he was unsurprised to see that the top issue -- the economy -- was consistent between all students and not only those not planning to vote. It ranks as the issue of most concern among young people in general according to numerous polls, and college students, juggling tuition costs and the often-high costs of living in a college town, often face the brunt of inflation and other economic challenges.He said he spoke to one Michigan student, for instance, who said he top issue of concern was reproductive rights, \"but she was struggling to pay attention to that when she was struggling to put food on the table as a college student.\"It may be near impossible to change the minds of students who are set on not voting, but when asked what steps college could take to make voting easier, 35 percent said canceling class on Election Day would be helpful. The second most common answer, though, at 26 percent, was that colleges shouldn't be encouraging students to vote.",

    "content": "PRINCETON - In old Princeton Cemetery, you could walk right past the grave of the only U.S. president buried in New Jersey and not realize it. Grover Cleveland's final resting place is an eight-foot-high stone marked by two small American flags and not much else.Henry Fallon has seen more impressive presidential gravesites, including the tomb of his favorite chief executive, Abraham Lincoln.\"It was just so big, as tall as a tree,\" he said. \"It shows how much people appreciated him.\"Though he just turned 11 years old, Fallon is somewhat of an expert on the subject. The fifth-grader from Jackson has visited all 40 presidential graves with his father T.J. Fallon, a historical gravesite enthusiast whose YouTube channel, \"Dead History,\" has 20,000 subscribers.Top political gravesites: The 5 best, worst and obscure ones you should visitT.J. Fallon has visited the burial place of every U.S. president and vice president and all the signers of the Declaration of Independence and Constitution -- minus the grave of Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, which is on the Rockefeller family estate in Sleepy Hollow, New York, and off-limits to visitors. He began his quest in 2020, after he was furloughed from his job during the pandemic, and once Henry grew old enough to become curious about his dad's hobby, the young man started coming along.Their journeys include typical kid-friendly stops like Major League Baseball parks (Henry's been to 14 of those).\"It's fun to travel and see these places,\" Henry said.As the 2024 presidential election approaches, he's learned some interesting lessons along the way -- the kind of stuff you can't get out of a social studies textbook.History happened here: Long Branch was once crawling with U.S. presidents. See the marks they left behind'This is not a political thing'There is no standard for presidential graves. Some, like Calvin Coolidge's, are the size of an average headstone.\"Then you go to New York and see (Ulysses) Grant's, and it's a building,\" Henry said. \"You can see it's a very important job.\"Most of them are easily approached by the public. Warren Harding's is gated, but \"being so little, Henry could slip in and get right up to the gravesite,\" T.J. said.George H.W. Bush's features the heaviest security, which is no accident. Bush is the most recent deceased president and in these divisive times, desecration attempts are an unfortunate possibility. That concern will heighten when Joe Biden and Donald Trump are laid to rest in the coming years.Local history: Do bootlegging tunnels crawl though Atlantic Highlands? Here is what radar study found.\"Every now and then we'll get some polarizing comments (on YouTube),\" T.J. Fallon said. \"I don't let anyone know where my political beliefs lie, but the comments we do get tend to be something like a right-wing conservative that is bashing a liberal policy Kennedy had 60 years ago. You can tell there's a lot of animosity behind the comment.\"Fallon's response: \"I try to remind people, regardless of what these (presidents') policies or beliefs were, they're still people. And some of them might not be the greatest of people -- they might even have been crappy human beings -- but I go to visit their graves to respect and remember them for being part of American history.\"I try to bring than human side and remind people this is not a political thing I'm doing.

Carter will be buried on his property next to his late wife Rosalynn.\"The National Park Service has already been down at his home making preparations for it to be accessible to the public once Jimmy passes away,\" T.J. said. \"I probably won't go right away. I'll wait until everything is in place, but I'm sure I'll probably go within six months to a year.\"In the meantime, T.J. and Henry are working on a new gravesite series for their YouTube channel (the channel itself was Henry's idea).\"People who ran for president and lost,\" T.J. said. \"I've been to 130 of them so far.\"The resting place of Bob Dole, who died in 2021 and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery, is high on the to-do list.2024 presidential race: Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff grew up in Old Bridge. So why does he keep claiming Matawan?Before then, though, Henry will accompany T.J. to their local polling place on Election Day. This is where it all ties together for a dad determined to raise a good citizen: With the notable exception of Gerald Ford, the presidents whose gravesites they've visited all have one thing in common: They were elected by fellow Americans.\"I want Henry to see what the process is like and understand the importance of voting and having a voice in who leads our country,\" T.J. said. \"As divisive as things are and as much as we need improvement in some ways, we still live in the greatest country in the world, and I want my son to remember that and respect that. That's all.\"",

    "title": "Abortion Overtakes Immigration in Voters' Minds",
    "content": "Abortion has overtaken immigration to become the second most important issue for voters heading into the 2024 election between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, Newsweek polling suggests.Over the past 16 months, a series of polls conducted byRedfield & Wilton Strategies ahead of the November 5 election asked participants: \"Which issues are most likely to determine how you vote in the November 2024 Presidential Election? You may select up to three.\"Only four issues out of 24 were repeatedly selected by more than two in five respondents: the economy, abortion, immigration and healthcare.The economy was named the most important election issue for voters in every survey conducted since July 2023, regularly being cited by around 60 percent of respondents.Abortion and immigration have both been competing for second place across the arc of the polling, but abortion was the issue that has risen most, and has overtaken immigration in recent months.Abortion was cited as a key issue by 21 percent of respondents in the first poll of July 2023, and was cited by 38 percent of respondents in the latest poll of October 2024. By contrast, immigration was cited as a key issue by 30 percent of respondents in the first poll of July 2023, and was cited by 36 percent of respondents in the latest poll of October 2024.Immigration has been the second most commonly cited issue by men, while abortion has consistently ranked as the second most important issue for women.This article is part of Newsweek's tracker polling, where Americans have been asked questions on topics such as abortion, immigration and the war in Ukraine over the past 16 months.This data is based on polling conducted exclusively by Redfield & Wilton Strategies on behalf of Newsweek between July 2023 and October 2024. Altogether, 19 polls were conducted, asking cumulatively 34,800 eligible voters about the key issues of the 2024 election.As the 2024 election approaches, the most pressing concerns for voters will be taking center stage in the campaigns of Trump and Harris. The race remains neck-and-neck, wider polling suggests, and may ultimately come down to just a few thousand votes in key battleground states like Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Arizona.\"In such a highly contested political context, neither candidate can afford to yield ground on any issue -- whether the economy, reproductive rights, immigration, democracy, or the rule of law,\" Cary Coglianese, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania, told Newsweek.Healthcare was identified as a main issue for about one in three voters each month. It placed second in the polls conducted in 2023, but has been in fourth place across the last several polls of 2024.Housing, the environment, taxation, and government spending are lower down, with between 10 and 20 percent of poll respondents seeing them as a top concern.Other concerns that saw minor declines across the polling include foreign policy, Covid, and policing and crime.\"The attempt by both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to diminish the surging importance of immigration initially succeeded but ultimately failed, with immigration moving from a clear second earlier this year to fourth in terms of importance over the summer before recovering to being virtually tied with abortion for second, Philip van Scheltinga, director of research at Redfield & Wilton Strategies, told Newsweek.\"The Harris campaign has had some success in accentuating the issue of abortion, particularly among female and young voters. However, while abortion is now the most important issue for Harris voters, slightly above the economy, the primacy of this issue has not quite registered for the rest of the voting public and the swing voters who will decide this election.\"Harris and the Democrats have made maintaining abortion rights and reproductive healthcare a key campaign pledge.In a recent appearance on the Call Her Daddy podcast, Harris told host Alex Cooper that the government shouldn't be telling women about their own reproductive rights.\"What's so outrageous about it is a bunch of these guys up in these state capitals are writing these decisions because they somehow have decided that they're in a better position to tell you what's in your best interest than you are to know what's in your own best interest,\" Harris said.Trump, meanwhile, has largely avoided the topic. He has said he wants abortion access to remain decided by individual states, repeatedly taking credit for the overturning of Roe v. Wade, having nominated three conservative justices on the Supreme Court bench who voted to quash the landmark abortion legislation in June 2022. He has denied he would sign a national abortion ban if he returned to the White House.Issues over reproductive rights will also be on the ballots in 10 states in November, including where abortion is now largely banned post-Roe v. Wade.The latest poll, conducted in October, found that 20 percent of 2024 Trump supporters view abortion as a key election issue, compared to 58 percent of Harris supporters.Silvina Alarcón, political director for abortion rights non-profit Reproductive Freedom for All, told Newsweek: \"Decisions about whether or when to start or grow our families should be our own to make. This issue matters to voters, and with Trump and MAGA Republicans' abortion bans threatening voters' lives and well-being, it will be top of mind as they head to the ballot box.\"The contrast between the two campaigns, and what they seek to do when they take office, is clear.\"Economy Remains 'Salient Issue'The polling shows that economic concerns remain paramount for voters across all demographics, including every age bloc, male and female voters, and whether they intend on backing Harris or Trump in November.Christopher Borick, a professor of political science and the director of polling organization at the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion in Pennsylvania, said that economic issues are \"perpetually one of the most salient\" for Americans in elections, and that the recent decades-high levels of inflation intensified these concerns.Trump positions himself as the candidate most trusted to handle economic issues, recalling a strong economy during his presidency.\"Trump has an easier sell on the matter, laying the blame on the current administration and offering a change of direction,\" Borrick told Newsweek.\"Harris has had to navigate a more challenging terrain, promoting the robust economic performance achieved during her tenure as VP, including declining inflation, while selling a new direction on economic policy that includes targeted tax breaks and subsidies to help the middle class attain goods such as homes that have been out of reach because of inflationary pressures.\"Harris can take solace in the economy largely improving in the run-up to the election.Gas prices have fallen, and inflation dropped to a three-year low of 2.5 percent in August. The current unemployment rate has also fallen to near historic lows of 4.1 percent, with the 254,000 jobs added to the labor market in September going way beyond estimations.The polling results also highlight generational differences in issue prioritization.Immigration appears to gain importance the older voters get. Around one-quarter of Gen Z (those aged 18-26) and Millennials (aged 27-42) listed it among their main issues, whereas it was regularly cited by almost half of those in the Boomer generation (aged 59 to 75.)Roughly a fifth to a quarter of Gen Z and Millennial voters regularly place housing among their top election issues. In comparison, the polling shows only around one in 10 of the Boomer generation will take housing into account when they cast their vote in November.",

    "content": "Race to 270: Battleground states could decide the election, Harris and Trump neck-and-neck in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and WisconsinAs the 2024 US presidential election approaches, Vice President Kamala Harris holds a narrow lead over former President Donald Trump in national polling averages.With election day set for Nov. 5, Harris is polling at 48.2%, while Trump follows closely at 46.4%, according to recent data from ABC News and 538.However, the national numbers do not tell the full story. The race remains fiercely competitive in key battleground states, where the election will likely be decided.Both candidates are locked in a virtual tie in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.Trump, who won these states in 2016 but lost them in 2020, hopes to reclaim them, while Harris aims to maintain her slim edge.Pennsylvania, with the highest number of electoral votes among the swing states, is critical for both campaigns. With 19 electoral votes, Harris and Trump are in a statistical tie in Pennsylvania, with Trump slightly ahead at 47.9% to Harris's 47.5%. Winning this state could heavily tilt the election in either candidate's favor.Michigan, which flipped back to the Democrats in 2020 after Trump's 2016 win, is another key state Harris needs to retain. With 15 electoral votes, Harris holds a narrow lead, polling at 47.4% compared to Trump's 47.2%.Wisconsin has been a battleground since 2016, and both candidates are vying to win this pivotal Midwest state. With 10 electoral votes, Harris is ahead in Wisconsin, with 47.8% compared to Trump's 47.6%.Arizona remains one of the tightest contests, with 11 electoral votes. The state, which voted for Biden in 2020, will be a significant bellwether for both parties, with Trump ahead at 48.6%, while Harris at 46.7%.After flipping blue in 2020, Georgia has become a critical state for Democrats to defend in 2024. With 16 electoral votes, Trump has a slim advantage in Georgia, leading with 48.7% to Harris's 46.9%.North Carolina remains a battleground, having leaned towards Republicans in recent cycles, but Democrats are hopeful to make gains this year. With 16 electoral votes, Trump holds a narrow lead in North Carolina at 48%, with Harris polling at 47.5%.With 6 electoral votes, Harris is slightly ahead in Nevada, with 47.6% compared to Trump's 47.1%. This small but crucial swing state remains a key target for both campaigns as they compete for its electoral votes.The tight margins underscore the unpredictability of the race, with both candidates vying for the 270 electoral votes needed to secure the presidency.Though Harris has seen a steady lead since Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race in July, the contest remains too close to call in crucial swing states.If Trump holds onto his leads in Georgia, Arizona, and North Carolina, while flipping Pennsylvania, he could secure the 270 electoral votes needed for victory. Conversely, if Harris can maintain her lead in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Nevada, while regaining ground in Pennsylvania, she would be on course to become the nation's first woman president.With swing states holding the balance, the 2024 election is shaping up to be another closely contested race, with both candidates battling for every vote in the final days before Nov. 5.",

    "content": "Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged higher Monday, retaining recent strength as the US presidential election draws near and polls point to a rising likelihood of former President Donald Trump prevailing.At 04:30 ET (08:30 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% higher to 103.462, after posting gains of around 0.6% last week.Dollar boosted by Trump confidenceThe dollar remained near its highest levels for over two months, boosted by increasing conviction that U.S. interest rates will fall at a slower pace than initially expected, especially as recent data showed the U.S. economy remained relatively healthy.The CME Fedwatch showed traders have largely cemented a 25 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve in November.The greenback has also been boosted by increased expectations that Donald Trump will defeat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, which is less than two weeks away.Trump's proposed tariff and tax policies are seen as likely to keep U.S. interest rates high and undermine currencies of trading partners.\"FX markets seem to be positioning for a Trump victory in next month's US presidential election. October seems to have been a good month for Donald Trump in opinion polls and the dollar is bid across the board,\" said analysts at ING, in a note.Euro hit by weak German PPIIn Europe, EUR/USD edged 0.1% lower to 1.0850, after German producer prices fell more than expected in September, declining 1.4% year on year, instead of the 1.0% anticipated.The European Central Bank is likely to cut its key interest rate down to its \"natural\" level between 2% and 3% but it may need to reduce it even further if a fall in inflation becomes entrenched, ECB policymaker Gediminas Simkus said on Monday.\"If the disinflation processes get entrenched... it's possible that rates will be lower than the natural level,\" Simkus, the Lithuanian central bank governor, told reporters in Vilnius.GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.3022, after data showed that asking prices for British homes rose only 0.3% in October, well below their average for a 1.3% monthly increase for the month, according to property website Rightmove (OTC:RTMVY).This, along with the surprise fall in services inflation last week, points to back-to-back rate cuts by the Bank of England in the upcoming months as the central bank attempts to stimulate the British economy.Yuan slips after PBOC cuts ratesUSD/CNY rose 0.2% to 7.1120, after the PBOC cut its benchmark loan prime rate by 25 basis points, with Monday's cut coming amid a flurry of recent stimulus measures from Beijing.China has announced its most aggressive round of stimulus measures yet over the past month, outlining both monetary and fiscal measures to shore up sluggish growth.USD/JPY rose 0.3% to 149.91, but remained below 150 after having breached that key level briefly last week for the first time since early August.",

He runs a research firm that conducted polls for a PAC supporting the Joe Biden and Kamala Harris campaigns.Generation Z is poised to flex its growing political muscle in the 2024 presidential election, and in my surveys and focus groups with these voters, I'm seeing the strong potential for a turning point in American political alignment. Unlike other recent Republican presidential nominees, Donald Trump is making young men a central focus of his campaign. If effective, his effort could peel enough away from the Democratic Party to transform the country's electoral math for years to come.Recent data from the Harvard Youth Poll, a national survey I oversee for the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics, reveals an increasing political rift between young men and women under 30, two groups critical to Democrats' success in recent elections. Almost exactly equal shares of young men and young women say they will definitely vote in this election or have already done so. But since the spring of 2020, the share of young men identifying as registered Democrats has dropped by seven percentage points, while those identifying as Republicans have increased by seven points -- a net shift of 14 points in just four years. Young women, during the same period, shifted two points away from the Republicans.Take one young Pittsburgh man I met in a recent focus group. A college graduate working part-time as a bartender, he felt weighed down by hopelessness, adrift in a country where rising costs, stagnant wages and lack of affordable housing have made even the modest ambitions of other generations feel out of reach for him. \"Hope is great,\" he told me, \"but I see nothing for the future.\"The young man's experience reflects a broader crisis of confidence and purpose, rooted in economic insecurity and social disconnection. The Covid pandemic exacerbated the alienation, with many first-time voters spending thousands of hours isolated and online in their formative years.While these struggles affect the whole country, they weigh especially on young men of all educational, racial and ethnic backgrounds. Nearly three-quarters of Gen Z men report feeling regularly stressed by an uncertain future, stirring painful memories of the Great Recession they witnessed as children. These feelings erode self-esteem and diminish their interest in personal relationships and long-term planning, leading many to describe their future as \"bleak,\" \"unclear\" and \"scary.\"Today's young men are lonelier than ever and have inherited a world rife with skepticism toward the institutions designed to promote and defend American ideals. Men under 30 are nearly twice as likely to be single as women their same age; Gen Z men are less likely to enroll in college or the work force than previous generations. They have higher rates of suicide and are less likely than their female peers to receive treatment for mental health maladies. Most young men in my polling say they fear for our country's future, and nearly half doubt their cohort's ability to meet our nation's coming challenges.Mr. Trump has tapped these anxieties by weaving a hypermasculine message of strength and defiance into his broader narrative that undermines confidence in democratic institutions. And it's working. Aware that boasting about \"killing\" Roe v. Wade drove away young women, Mr. Trump zeroed in on capturing a larger share of the young male vote. In four years, he cut what was once a 19-percentage point Democratic margin among registered young male voters (50 percent Mr. Biden, 31 percent Mr. Trump) roughly in half (48 percent Ms. Harris, 38 percent Mr. Trump) in our poll.His playbook? A master class in bro-whispering: championing crypto, securing the endorsement of Dave Portnoy -- the unapologetically offensive founder of Barstool Sports -- and giving U.F.C. President Dana White, who embodies the alpha-male archetype that appeals to many young men, a prime spot at the Republican National Convention. Mr. Trump has also cultivated relationships with simpatico comedians, pranksters, influencers and Silicon Valley billionaires like Elon Musk -- all while his team bombards podcasts and social media with misinformation and memes to rally his troops.This shift in support for Mr. Trump among men is neither organic nor unexpected. It's what happens when a well-coordinated political operation invests tens of millions of dollars to amplify Mr. Trump's narrative and weaken confidence in the party in power. Compared with when Mr. Trump ran in 2020, young male voters are now less likely to support government-backed climate change solutions (down 15 points, according to our poll) and affirmative action for qualified candidates (down eight points). They are more likely to question immigration policy (up 12 points), free trade (up 10 points) and whether government stimulus leads to economic growth (up seven points). They are also more likely to believe that religious values should play a more important role in government (up six points).Is this rightward drift among young men simply a short-lived, Trump-inspired episode or a more permanent transformation? The answer lies partly in Ms. Harris's ability to connect with and motivate young voters as the campaign nears its end.To be sure, she is doing better than Mr. Biden. Among men 18 to 29, her favorable rating is 44 percent, seven percentage points higher than Mr. Biden's and thirteen points higher than Mr. Trump's. While Mr. Biden's age and traditional political approach often created distance with younger voters, Ms. Harris's ability to engage across digital platforms and tap into youth culture sets her apart. Our polling also shows that while Mr. Trump has made significant inroads with young men, more still find Ms. Harris more relatable and competent. Mr. Trump still holds a narrow advantage on the economy, patriotism and strength, but Ms. Harris's connection with young men continues to grow, suggesting she has yet to reach her ceiling with this demographic.But to win more votes from young men, Ms. Harris must address their fears head-on and present a bold vision that speaks to their desire for purpose and strength. Of course, a clear economic vision that charts a pathway to financial independence is paramount, but it may not be enough to counter Mr. Trump's appeal on this issue in the closing days. Ms. Harris needs to go big.Here's one way. To reignite the hope of the emerging generation, Ms. Harris should make a sweeping national call to both military and civilian service -- name it the Generation Z Compact to Rebuild and Renew America. Such a plan would offer a sense of identity, community and patriotism, while providing economic stability and skill-building -- things many young men feel they are missing.Young Americans have consistently voiced support for national service programs, yet political action has yet to catch up. A 2021 survey revealed that 71 percent of adults under 25 were open to participating in a service program. Even more striking, a poll conducted last year found that about 75 percent of young people backed mandatory national service. These numbers tell a clear story: Our youth's appetite for civic engagement is strong and growing.From President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal Civilian Conservation Corps in 1933 to President John F. Kennedy's Peace Corps in 1961 to President Bill Clinton's AmeriCorps in 1993, national service has been a cornerstone of American resilience, transformation and progress. More than three decades after the last significant civic engagement initiative, Kamala Harris can frame national service as a pathway to rebuilding America's strength from within, addressing growing concerns about military recruitment and bridging political divides with a renewed sense of shared responsibility.Donald Trump has gained ground with Gen Z by systematically exploiting the fears and insecurities of young men, making them feel that their masculinity and future are under siege. Kamala Harris can counter that narrative by listening and recognizing their fears but also by offering something more profound: a vision of hope, strength and shared purpose.John Della Volpe is the director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics. He is the author of \"Fight: How Gen Z Is Channeling Their Fear and Passion to Save America.\" He was a pollster for Joe Biden's presidential campaign in 2020 and runs a research firm that conducted polls for a PAC supporting the Joe Biden and Kamala Harris campaigns.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

    "title": "Some Jewish voters in presidential swing states reconsider their longtime devotion to Democrats",
    "content": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- For Rona Kaufman, the signs are everywhere that more Jews feel abandoned by the Democratic Party and may vote for Republican Donald Trump.It's in her Facebook feed. It's in the discomfort she observed during a question-and-answer at a recent Democratic Party campaign event in Pittsburgh. It's in her own family.\"The family that is my generation and older generations, I don't think anybody is voting for Harris, and we've never voted Republican, ever,\" Kaufman, 49, said, referring to Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. \"My sister has a Trump sign outside her house, and that is a huge shift.\"How big a shift? Surveys continue to find that most Jewish voters still support the Democratic ticket, and Kaufman acknowledges that she's an exception.Still, any shift could have enormous implications in Pennsylvania, where tens of thousands of votes decided the past two presidential elections. Many Jewish voters say the 2024 presidential election is like no other in memory, coming amid the growing fallout from Hamas' brutal attack on Israelis last year.Jews represent a sliver of the voting-age population in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, the so-called blue wall of states that Democrats have come to rely on in recent presidential elections. In a close election, they are a big enough constituency that the campaigns of Harris and Trump see the potential for any slippage to swing a close contest.That has forced Harris to walk a line between traditional Democratic constituencies with strong feelings about the war in Gaza, both Jews and Arab Americans -- balancing support for Israel with outrage over the deaths of Israeli and Palestinian civilians and destruction in the region. The Biden administration has been pressuring Israel to end its attacks, which continued last week with the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by Israeli troops.Trump has looked to exploit the opening among Jewish voters especially, saying Harris \" doesn't like \" Jewish people, Jews who don't vote for him \"need their head examined \" and that he'll be the \" best friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the White House.\"In the past, surveys have shown that Jews overwhelmingly vote Democratic. A Pew Research Center poll released last month found that about two-thirds of Jewish voters back Harris. In 2020, about 7 in 10 Jewish voters supported President Joe Biden, according to AP VoteCast.The question is whether that has changed, as Jews now see Israel's survival in a new light as its war with Hamas widens to Hezbollah and Iran.That has put a new focus on the relationship between Israel and the U.S., which continues to provide military aid. And many Jews say rising acts of antisemitism in the United States and anti-Israel protests sweeping across cities and college campuses -- including in Philadelphia -- have made them feel unsafe.In Pennsylvania, still fresh in many minds is a gunman absorbed by white supremacist ideology murdering 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018, the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.As Pennsylvania plays a central role in the election, many say they've never seen such outreach from campaigns as they have now.From Trump on down, Republicans are attempting to win over Jewish voters by highlighting a Democratic Party torn between its traditional and unconditional support for Israel and a growing faction that has accused Israel of war crimes in Gaza, called for Israel to unconditionally stop attacking Hamas, and demanded that the U.S. end its military support for Israel.For some Jews who typically vote Democratic, that has resonated.\"I think that there are folks who are reluctant Trump voters who feel scared as Jews in this country,\" said Jeremy Kazzaz, a Pittsburgh resident and Harris supporter.Kazzaz, however, said Harris has a long record of fighting antisemitism that is relatively unknown to many voters.He pointed out that the Biden administration tapped her husband, Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, to lead a task force to develop a strategy to fight antisemitism well before Hamas attacked Israel. Emhoff has been a key surrogate, campaigning in front of Jewish audiences in the Philadelphia suburbs and speaking at the groundbreaking of a new complex replacing Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue.Still, where Harris' supporters see strong support of Israel -- for instance, the Biden administration sent a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery to Israel, along with the troops needed to operate it -- others see conditional support.That includes Biden urging Israel not to hit Iran's nuclear program or oil fields. At the same time, Biden has stressed his administration's support for Israel and, in her remarks on the anniversary of Hamas' attack, Harris said she'll \"always ensure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself and that I will always work to ensure the safety and security of the Jewish people here and around the world.\"Steve Rosenberg, of Philadelphia, who voted for Trump in 2016 and then Biden in 2020, will vote for Trump in 2024. In large part, Rosenberg sees Biden's lifting of Trump-era sanctions on Iran as providing the cash for the Islamic Republic to finance a war against Israel. Trump imposed the sanctions after voiding a treaty the Obama administration had reached to slow Iran's progress toward nuclear weapons, which he called a bad deal.\"The question is, 'Who is better off today than four years ago?'\" Rosenberg said. \"And the answer is Iran and the mullahs and their proxies, and it's because Biden and Kamala Harris have capitulated to Iran.\"Kaufman, a self-described progressive who lives in Pittsburgh's heavily Jewish Squirrel Hill neighborhood, never thought she would vote for Trump.But now, she expects Trump will continue a hardline stance against Iran -- which she calls an imminent threat to democracy, human rights and western civilization -- and worries that Harris will appease Iran and pander to the party's left wing.Jews with very strong connections to Israel -- her parents were born there and her daughter just finished a two-year eight-month mandatory service with the Israeli army -- are similarly conflicted over supporting Harris, Kaufman said. \"I'm saying it out loud everywhere, but most people aren't saying it out loud.\"Many Jews who support Harris, however, say they see Trump as a threat to democracy.That's important, they say, because minorities -- including Jews -- have reason to fear persecution under dictators.They can unfurl a list of comments by Trump that they see as threatening: using the military against domestic enemies, peddling dual-loyalty tropes about Jews, setting up Jews as scapegoats if he loses and, in the days after Hamas' attack, criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while praising Hezbollah as \"very smart.\"Emhoff called Trump a \"known antisemite.\"Some see Trump's efforts on Jan. 6, 2021, to stay in power as a threat. Many are wary of his affinity for dictators, and bring up his dinner at his Mar-a-Lago resort with far-right activist Nick Fuentes and rapper Ye, two men known for spewing antisemitic rhetoric.\"That's the conversation that I'm having with Jews,\" said Rabbi Beth Janus of Philadelphia.Janus said Jews she knows are excited that a woman could be president and that she's married to a Jewish man. Conversely, Trump's support for Israel is transactional, she said.\"When it serves his needs, his objectives, he supports Israel,\" Janus said. \"But if it didn't, then he wouldn't support Israel.\"",

    "title": "Taxes, trade, and tech: why the US election matters for SA investors",
    "content": "As the race for the White House continues - with the US presidential elections scheduled to take place in less than three weeks' time - South African investors are reminded that the stakes extend far beyond political leadership, and the global economic ramifications are substantial and far reaching.This is according to Brian Arcese, global fund manager at Foord, who says that with Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Donald Trump in national polls - albeit with razor-thin margins - the potential policy shifts could significantly impact South African investors' global investment strategies.Rashaad Tayob, Macro Strategist and Portfolio Manager at Foord says that several of the latest national polls appear to favour Harris, but some are within the margin of error, reflecting an incredibly tight race. Ultimately, swing states are likely to decide the 2024 presidential election and resulting policy shifts.They outline six key areas for local investors to note as the countdown to the election continues:1. Tax policiesArcese explains that a Harris victory could result in higher corporate taxes, which may affect global market performance and increase risks for local investors. \"Aside from rising corporate tax rates, investors could face higher capital gains taxes, taxes on carried interest, share buybacks, spinoffs, and executive compensation. In short, limited exclusively to tax, a Harris win would be viewed as a negative for corporate profitability and investor returns.\"Tayob notes that Trump cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% in his first term and is looking to reduce taxes to as low as 15% for domestic manufacturers. Trump is also promising a somewhat haphazard range of tax exemptions on tips, overtime and social security payments. \"While tax cuts will be good for the consumer and the economy, the already large deficit makes significant tax cuts impractical at this point.\"2. Regulatory landscapeRegulation is another area where the presidential candidates differ, particularly concerning financial institutions. \"A Harris presidency may cement the adoption of Basel III capital rules, requiring large US banks to increase capital reserves, and potentially lowering returns -- a win for regulators,\" says Arcese. \"A Trump administration, however, would likely favour deregulation, easing capital requirements and potentially boosting bank returns -- a win for shareholders.\"3. Big techWhen it comes to big tech, both candidates share concerns, but their strategies diverge. \"A Trump victory would likely maintain the current administration's efforts to limit the dominance of big tech companies through antitrust actions,\" notes Arcese. \"While a Harris administration might continue scrutinising these firms, analysts anticipate a more balanced approach, possibly leading to settlements in less substantiated cases involving giants like Apple and Amazon.\"Tayob explains that as large cap US tech stocks continue to dominate global indices and investor portfolios, local investors are likely to be impacted by aggressive antitrust action, which could be a headwind for returns, especially in the context of high starting valuations.4. Tariffs and tradeHarris and Trump also align in favouring protectionist trade policies, especially regarding China, which could result in higher tariffs and increased market volatility. Arcese warns that imposing high tariffs could bring about unintended consequences, such as making US industries complacent and less competitive globally.\"The Biden administration, with Harris as its extension, has already introduced significant tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and restricted semiconductor exports. Trump, on the other hand, advocates a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods. These tariffs will impact global supply chains, potentially driving inflation and affecting South African import costs.\"However, he cautions that tariffs may not achieve their intended outcomes. \"China remains the world's largest producer of clean energy products and is well-positioned to maintain its dominance, regardless of US protectionist policies. The impact of these tariffs may be more inflationary than corrective, raising costs for US consumers while failing to weaken China's global position.\"China's record trade surplus and dominance of Electric Vehicles and clean energy is a testament to the competitiveness of their economy. While they provide subsidies and support to local industries, so do developed markets including the US and Europe. Tayob explains that Trump's intention to implement broad tariffs on China could result in retaliatory tariffs and potentially a trade war between the two largest economies in the world. \"This will not be good for global growth, and South African investors could be negatively impacted in this scenario.\"5. Energy policyEnergy policy presents one of the starkest contrasts between the candidates. Arcese notes that a Harris presidency would likely continue the current focus on renewable energy, accelerating the transition to green energy through tax credits and subsidies, particularly under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). \"A continuation of these policies would benefit clean energy sectors and support investment in renewable technologies, which could drive long-term shifts in the global energy market.\"Conversely, Trump's pro-drilling stance could increase domestic oil production, leading to short-term gains for oil service companies but potentially undermining global efforts to transition to net-zero emissions. Tayob adds, \"While long-term green energy transitions remain crucial, a Trump presidency may offer opportunities in traditional energy sectors over the next few years.\"6. GeopoliticsTayob explains that the outbreak of wars in Ukraine and the Middle East reflects poorly on Biden, especially compared to the relatively peaceful period during Trump's first term. \"Trump has historically been antiwar preferring bluster and dealmaking, which is consistent with his business - rather than political - background. He has repeatedly stated his intention to end the Ukraine war in his first week, and is likely to adopt a more pragmatic approach as the military industrial complex will have less influence if he is president.\"The winner of the election is inheriting an economy with robust growth and low unemployment, albeit driven by government spending and deficits not seen outside of a severe recession. A move to trim the deficit will slow the economy, while continuing to spend at this rate increases the risk of a debt crisis in the coming years. The next president faces a difficult task in ensuring both a soft landing and debt sustainability.While US presidential elections do not materially drive markets, Tayob says that these areas of policy divergence between the candidates will indeed affect corporate profitability and South African investor returns. \"The US election outcome could significantly impact markets, taxes, regulations, and investment strategies. While we aren't political prognosticators, we've positioned our portfolios to not only weather this uncertainty but also to take advantage of the opportunities we see ahead,\" he concludes.",

Portnoy, host of the popular \"BFFs\" podcast, shared the touching moment on social media, showing the note that the \"Cruel Summer\" singer had penned ahead of the concert.In the note, Swift expressed her gratitude, writing, \"Dave, I'm so happy to have you at the show tonight! I wanted to say thank you for always being so supportive, so loyal, and for having my back when a lot of people didn't.\" The letter, adorned with her signature wax seal featuring her lucky number 13, was a token of appreciation for Portnoy's consistent support.Portnoy, who had publicly defended Swift following her endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris for the 2024 presidential election, was thrilled by the gesture. He shared his excitement with fans, revealing how much the note meant to him. \"Not everyone agrees on every issue, but being a Swiftie is about love and support,\" he said in a video posted on X (formerly Twitter), emphasizing his admiration for Swift despite political differences.Portnoy had a memorable night at the concert, meeting Swift's brother Austin and her mother, Andrea, though he didn't meet Taylor herself. He reflected that the handwritten note held more significance to him than meeting the star in person, saying it showed that she took time out of her busy schedule to acknowledge him.The gesture was especially meaningful after Portnoy initially thought he had been overlooked for a personal invite to the concert. Last month, Swift had sparked mixed reactions when she endorsed Kamala Harris for president on Instagram, but Portnoy stood by her, stating that people are free to vote however they choose, and it wouldn't affect his admiration for the singer.",

    "content": "Morning commuter traffic waits to cross into the United States from Tijuana, Mexico, in March. South of San Diego, the San Ysidro Port of Entry is the largest land crossing between the two countries and the most transited in the Western Hemisphere. Some 70,000 vehicles and 20,000 pedestrians pass through there daily. Border and immigration issues have become dominant themes in the 2024 presidential election. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Among the most persistent political talking points raised by opponents of immigration is that migrants bring crime with them into the U.S.\"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best,\" former President Donald Trump famously said on the campaign trail in 2016.\"Has anybody ever seen the movie 'Gangs of New York'?\" Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance asked during a meeting with the Milwaukee Police Association in August. \"We know that when you have these massive ethnic enclaves forming in our country, it can sometimes lead to higher crime rates.\"In reality, the opposite is true. Immigrants are far less likely than U.S.-born citizens to commit crimes, numerous studies show. One study of incarceration rates going back over 150 years -- between 1870 and 2020 -- found that U.S.-born citizens were consistently more likely to end up in prison than immigrants. And the gap between the two groups has only increased in recent years, with immigrants 60% less likely to be incarcerated than U.S.-born citizens today, according to the nonpartisan National Bureau of Economic Research.Assertions that immigrants have caused spikes in crime in the areas where they settle have also been proven false. Overall, incidents of crime, including violent crime, have fallen in cities across the country since peaking during the pandemic, FBI data shows. And while politicians have claimed that border cities have been overwhelmed by lawlessness and chaos, the data shows that crime rates, including for homicide, are far lower than the national average.The equation of immigrants with criminals is exhausting to hear for Irayda Flores, a businesswoman in Phoenix, Arizona. Flores moved to the Grand Canyon State from Sonora, Mexico, in 2004, hoping to make her entrepreneurial dreams a reality. Since then, her seafood wholesale business, El Mar de Cortez Corp, has thrived, serving restaurants across the city and employing more than a dozen people. But despite the example she and other immigrants provide, politicians continue to frame them as villains.The rhetoric is the same every election year, she said, and it ignores the positive contributions of many of the immigrants who left their home countries to seek a better future.\"Politicians talk about the migrant community like they're criminals, like they are really awful people,\" Flores said. \"But when migrants leave their country -- their culture and the land that they were born and grew up in -- they do it because they're searching for opportunity. And searching for a new opportunity means they come here with the intention to work and get ahead.\"Dismissing all immigrants as criminals is harmful, she added, and unfair to the work many immigrants have put in to make a difference in their host communities.\"You can't generalize or treat an entire immigrant group as criminals because there are people who've lived in the country for decades, and they bring benefits to the table,\" Flores said. \"They benefit the economy, they benefit their communities, and they deserve to be treated with respect.\"While the campaign season has prompted politicians to stir up voters about an \"invasion\" at the country's southern border, the situation is more complex. In late 2023, the number of migrant encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border hit record highs. In December 2023, more than 300,000 encounters between border officials and migrants occurred at the country's southern border -- an all-time high. Experts believe the surge was, in part, the result of a global spike in migration patterns caused by economic strains during the pandemic.!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data)for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e.contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data+\"px\";e.style.height=i}}}))}();In January 2024 the record high set in December plummeted to about 176,000 encounters. The number eventually fell to a three-year low not seen since before the pandemic. In August, the month for which the most recent data is available, encounters increased slightly from to 107,503 from 104,101 in July.The U.S.-Mexico border stretches across nearly 2,000 miles and includes 26 land ports of entry. U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents monitor both ports and the spaces in between. The vast majority of fentanyl is smuggled into the U.S. via legal routes by citizens, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security reports. More than 90% of interdicted fentanyl is confiscated by border officials at land ports of entry, according to DHS, and cartels mainly seek to move the drug across the border with the help of U.S. citizens. In fiscal year 2023, the latest year for which there is data, 86.4% of fentanyl trafficking convictions were citizens.In most cases, immigrants who aren't citizens of the United States are ineligible for public benefits. Federal programs like Section 8 housing aid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid, and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) are all strictly reserved for U.S. citizens.Immigrants who aren't citizens also can't receive subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, and they can't apply for federal health insurance coverage through the marketplace.People with legal permanent residency status, however, may be able to access some public benefits after reaching the five-year residency mark.Some federal protections are in place to ensure that migrants have access to care if they are facing life-threatening circumstances. Emergency Medicaid helps migrants without legal status receive urgent medical treatment, and some benefits are available to migrant women under the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program.Eligibility for state public benefit programs varies across the country and can range from access to driver's licenses to in-state tuition rates and scholarships.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXGaining citizenship is a costly, multistep and complicated process. And backlogged naturalization and asylum systems mean long wait times for hopeful migrants.Those seeking to achieve legal status through marriage must pass a number of hurdles meant to verify that the marriage is genuine, including periodic interviews with immigration officials. Couples often spend hundreds or thousands of dollars and years in the application process.Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals grants people without legal status who were brought to the country as minors protection from deportation and a temporary work permit, but recipients must meet strict criteria to qualify. That includes living in the U.S. since 2007, having arrived in the country before turning 16, no significant criminal convictions and either current enrollment in a high school, a diploma or a GED.DACA recipients who were accepted into the program must reapply for a renewal every two years. And while recipients can apply for legal residency status if they are eligible through their family or via employment-based immigration, the DACA program is currently frozen. Though applications are still being accepted, they aren't being processed while the program is under ongoing litigation that threatens to end it altogether.Asylum seekers must undergo fear screenings with immigration officials to determine if their concerns about persecution or threats to their lives warrant being granted protection in the U.S. New guidance issued by the Biden administration barring the consideration of asylum claims when high numbers of migrant encounters occur has made it more difficult for people to request asylum.Those hoping for a resolution in their asylum or refugee cases might wait years. In 2019, the immigration backlog ballooned to more than 1 million cases, a number that only doubled in the following years. As of September, the number of pending immigration cases exceeded 3 million. The average time it takes to close a case is four years, according to Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, an organization that compiles and analyzes federal immigration data.Roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants live in the United States, and all of them pay some form of taxes. An analysis of the 2022 American Community Survey, an annual demographics survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, estimated that immigrants contributed $383 billion in federal taxes, and $196 billion in state and local taxes. And while people without legal status can't benefit from Social Security, the administration receives about $13 billion from the paychecks of workers without citizenship status every year.Saúl Rascón moved to the U.S. with his family when he was 5-years-old. He became a DACA recipient in high school and has been employed ever since. Today, he works with Aliento Votes, a pro-immigrant voter outreach campaign. Accusations that immigrants don't pay their taxes irritate Rascón, who views it as a way to diminish the demographic group's contributions.\"It's particularly frustrating when immigrants are pinned as this economic deficit and harm when it's been proven time and time again that they're not,\" he said.The problem, Rascón said, is that the claim is believable to the average voter who doesn't do additional research. And that claim is dangerous for all immigrants, including himself, because it could engender hostility towards the community as a whole.The spread of disinformation about immigrants is harmful, he added, not just because it fosters anti-immigrant sentiment, but also because it makes it more difficult to find common ground when it comes to changing the country's immigration system. While Republican politicians have focused on riling up their base against immigrants, Democrats have shifted to the right on the issue, increasingly spotlighting enforcement policy to capture as many votes as possible.\"We're no longer focusing our energy on our Dreamers and DACA, on undocumented people who've been here, and contributing taxes,\" Rascón said. \"We've seen a shift towards border security, which isn't unproductive but it's not the best use of our time and resources.\"",

Voters in several states are casting their ballots, both in person and via mail, and the candidates are making strategic efforts to encourage as much early voting as possible.Harris, in particular, has been vocal about the advantages of early voting, aiming to \"bank\" votes before election day, which she sees as a critical strategy in a highly polarized political landscape. Trump, while generally critical of early voting, has also been encouraging his supporters to vote early, reflecting a pragmatic shift in his campaign.Endorsements and Criticisms Shape the NarrativeOne of the most significant developments in the lead-up to the election was the formal endorsement of Kamala Harris by former President Barack Obama. Obama, a key figure in the Democratic Party, praised Harris's long-standing commitment to public service and her alignment with core American values.He characterized her as a leader prepared to \"turn the page\" and represent the next generation of leadership in the White House. This endorsement came at a pivotal time, lending Harris much-needed momentum as she seeks to solidify her position in the race.At the same time, Obama has not held back from criticizing Trump. He raised concerns about the Trump administration's handling of economic challenges, including rising prices that have strained American households, and criticized Trump for his divisive rhetoric.Obama argued that Trump's focus on creating a narrative of national division ultimately serves his political goals but does little to address the real issues facing everyday Americans. In this context, Obama's remarks serve not only as an endorsement of Harris but also as a reminder to voters of the stakes of the election.Polls Show Tight Race in Key Swing StatesPolling data suggests a highly competitive race, particularly in crucial swing states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Georgia. These battleground states, where both candidates enjoy strong support, will likely determine the outcome of the election. Harris and Trump are neck-and-neck in these states, making it critical for both campaigns to maximize voter turnout.During a recent rally in Detroit, Harris teamed up with rapper Lizzo, emphasizing the importance of voter turnout in Michigan. The state's narrow margins in previous elections make every vote count, and Harris's campaign is pushing hard to engage younger and diverse voters, who are expected to play a pivotal role in this year's election.Escalating Personal AttacksAs the campaign reaches its final days, personal attacks between the candidates have become more frequent. Trump, known for his provocative rhetoric, has unleashed sharp criticisms against Harris, calling her a \"s--- vice president\" and accusing her of being more radical than other prominent Democrats. He has attempted to paint her as out of step with mainstream American values, particularly targeting her left-leaning policies.In response, Harris has not held back in her criticism of Trump, questioning his stability and ability to handle the demands of the presidency. During a campaign event in Atlanta, she described Trump as \"increasingly unstable and unhinged,\" implying that his behavior on the campaign trail signals an inability to lead effectively. Harris's campaign has centered on presenting a more measured and competent alternative to Trump's unpredictable style, framing the election as a choice between steady leadership and chaos.The Path Forward: Key Factors to WatchWith the election just days away, the dynamics of early voting, the endorsements from influential figures like Barack Obama, and the heated exchanges between Harris and Trump all add layers of complexity to the race. Trump's campaign has continued to lean on populist themes of economic frustration and national division, while Harris is positioning herself as a leader who can heal those divisions and move the country forward with stability and unity.Ultimately, the outcome of the 2024 US Presidential Election will likely be determined by voter turnout in key swing states, with the personal attacks and endorsement battles further shaping the perceptions of undecided voters. As both campaigns fight for every vote, this election is shaping up to be one of the most closely contested in recent history.",

    "content": "Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged higher Monday, retaining recent strength as the US presidential election draws near and polls point to a rising likelihood of former President Donald Trump prevailing.At 04:30 ET (08:30 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% higher to 103.462, after posting gains of around 0.6% last week.The dollar remained near its highest levels for over two months, boosted by increasing conviction that U.S. interest rates will fall at a slower pace than initially expected, especially as recent data showed the U.S. economy remained relatively healthy.The CME Fedwatch showed traders have largely cemented a 25 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve in November.The greenback has also been boosted by increased expectations that Donald Trump will defeat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, which is less than two weeks away.Trump's proposed tariff and tax policies are seen as likely to keep U.S. interest rates high and undermine currencies of trading partners.\"FX markets seem to be positioning for a Trump victory in next month's US presidential election. October seems to have been a good month for Donald Trump in opinion polls and the dollar is bid across the board,\" said analysts at ING, in a note.In Europe, EUR/USD edged 0.1% lower to 1.0850, after German producer prices fell more than expected in September, declining 1.4% year on year, instead of the 1.0% anticipated.The European Central Bank is likely to cut its key interest rate down to its \"natural\" level between 2% and 3% but it may need to reduce it even further if a fall in inflation becomes entrenched, ECB policymaker Gediminas Simkus said on Monday.\"If the disinflation processes get entrenched... it's possible that rates will be lower than the natural level,\" Simkus, the Lithuanian central bank governor, told reporters in Vilnius.GBP/USD fell 0.2% to 1.3022, after data showed that asking prices for British homes rose only 0.3% in October, well below their average for a 1.3% monthly increase for the month, according to property website Rightmove (OTC:RTMVY).This, along with the surprise fall in services inflation last week, points to back-to-back rate cuts by the Bank of England in the upcoming months as the central bank attempts to stimulate the British economy.USD/CNY rose 0.2% to 7.1120, after the PBOC cut its benchmark loan prime rate by 25 basis points, with Monday's cut coming amid a flurry of recent stimulus measures from Beijing.China has announced its most aggressive round of stimulus measures yet over the past month, outlining both monetary and fiscal measures to shore up sluggish growth.USD/JPY rose 0.3% to 149.91, but remained below 150 after having breached that key level briefly last week for the first time since early August.",

Returning Investment Minister Rosan Roeslani said Monday that he got the additional task of getting resource-rich Indonesia to move up the production value chain for many of its commodities.Prabowo has appointed businessman-turned-politician Rosan to keep his ministerial post under the newly established Merah Putih or Red and White Cabinet. Prabowo also gave the ministry the extra job of carrying out Indonesia's resource nationalism.This resource nationalism was at the centerpiece of Former President Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo's economic policies. This policy sees the country banning exports of raw minerals in favor of having them processed by the domestic industries. Indonesia already stopped exports of unprocessed nickel ores and will replicate the policy for other commodities.\" has put me in charge of  Indonesia's downstream industries. And this is not limited to mining, but plantations and fishery. It really is a vast scope of work because we have to really create the added value to spur growth,\" Rosan told the press.Indonesia already stopped its unprocessed nickel ore exports in 2020. Since then, Indonesian exports of nickel-related goods had jumped from just $1.4 billion prior to the ban to around $33 billion, according to Rosan. The minister said: \" has also tasked me to make sure that  create jobs. ... Going forward, we will prioritize the development of the seaweed downstream industries. We will see what sort of comparative advantage we can offer.\"The government has been trying to woo investors -- both from home and abroad -- to develop Indonesia's domestic refining and manufacturing industries. Government data shows that Indonesia has posted investments worth Rp 1,245.8 trillion (around $80 billion) in the overall downstream industries since 2020 as of September 2024. Some Rp 514.8 trillion went to the nickel smelting industry.Rosan officially became the investment minister in August 2024, replacing Bahlil Lahadalia who was appointed as the energy minister. Rosan was Prabowo's campaign team chief for the 2024 presidential election. Prabowo has also picked mining businessman Todotua Pasaribu as Rosan's deputy minister. Tags:",

Betting markets are opinions, too, but they are opinions backed up by billions of dollars. The smart money is now backing Trump 60-40.Betting on everything from elections to the date of the first measurable snowfall in London has long been legal in the U.K. The internet, combined with the security of blockchain money movements, spread wagering worldwide. Billions have already been bet on this election. Billions more dollars, Euros, yen, and even rubles will be gambled before November 5. Although the odds strongly favored Harris in the weeks after the Biden campaign bit the dust, the ongoing shift in betters' money-backed best guesses has now moved to Trump 3-2.According to Forbes, the wagering giant Polymarket recently broke the 60% ceiling. This is the first time Pres. Trump enjoyed such a wide margin since Biden dropped out (or was dropped out, take your pick) from the race. The survey company Election Betting Odds aggregates the betting markets like Real Clear Politics combines pollsters' predictions. EBO has Trump at 57%.The U.S. pollsters do not favor Pres. Trump that highly. Even so, RCP now has Trump up in the critical swing states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia, Arizona, and New Mexico. These are massive changes from two months ago. RCP is now predicting Trump would win with 312 of the required 270 electoral votes if the election were held today. Simply put, the projected ballots and bucks agree.The critical information for us is not just the betting percentages. It's how they are generated. These new numbers all come from people who are sure enough in their expectations to bet millions of dollars on the outcome.

    "content": "In the past seven years, crimes involving children have increased by more than a third.Such a rise in crime involving children occurred at a time when laws governing such crimes were loosened in the New York state. In the 2024 US presidential election, crime has emerged as a major issue, with Republicans considering it as the third most important issue after economy and immigration.The number of children involved in major crimes, such as murders, robberies, and assaults, in New York City increased during 2017-23 by 37 per cent, according to The New York Times.Those accused or arrested in felony assaults, in which a person is seriously injured or a deadly weapon like a gun or knife is used, jumped by 28 per cent since 2017, according to The Times.The newspaper's analysis showed that robberies involving children increased by 52 per cent and killings involving minors rose by more than 200 per cent.As child victims of crimes also rose by 54 per cent in the said period, Michael LiPetri, the head of New York Police crime strategies, told the paper that \"most of what we see is youth-on-youth crime\".Even though the crimes involving children have increased in the past seven years, such crimes remained a small fraction of the overall, amounting to around 3.8 per cent, as per the paper, which was around the same as 2017.The statistics have also reignited debate around the response to such crime. Before 2017, many children accused of serious crimes were treated as adults in courts. Lawmakers, however, changed the law in 2017 which led to most 16- and 17-year-olds being tried in family courts.As family courts' rulings are often sealed, police and prosecutors have found it hard to provide evidence of prior offensives when prosecuting repeat offenders, according to the newspaper.",

    "title": "Abortion overtakes immigration in voters' minds",
    "content": "Abortion has overtaken immigration to become the second most important issue for voters heading into the 2024 election between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, Newsweek polling suggests.Over the past 16 months, a series of polls conducted byRedfield & Wilton Strategies ahead of the November 5 election asked participants: \"Which issues are most likely to determine how you vote in the November 2024 Presidential Election? You may select up to three.\"Only four issues out of 24 were repeatedly selected by more than two in five respondents: the economy, abortion, immigration and healthcare.The economy was named the most important election issue for voters in every survey conducted since July 2023, regularly being cited by around 60 percent of respondents.Abortion and immigration have both been competing for second place across the arc of the polling, but abortion was the issue that has risen most, and has overtaken immigration in recent months.Abortion was cited as a key issue by 21 percent of respondents in the first poll of July 2023, and was cited by 38 percent of respondents in the latest poll of October 2024. By contrast, immigration was cited as a key issue by 30 percent of respondents in the first poll of July 2023, and was cited by 36 percent of respondents in the latest poll of October 2024.Immigration has been the second most commonly cited issue by men, while abortion has consistently ranked as the second most important issue for women.This article is part of Newsweek's tracker polling, where Americans have been asked questions on topics such as abortion, immigration and the war in Ukraine over the past 16 months.This data is based on polling conducted exclusively by Redfield & Wilton Strategies on behalf of Newsweek between July 2023 and October 2024. Altogether, 19 polls were conducted, asking cumulatively 34,800 eligible voters about the key issues of the 2024 election.As the 2024 election approaches, the most pressing concerns for voters will be taking center stage in the campaigns of Trump and Harris. The race remains neck-and-neck, wider polling suggests, and may ultimately come down to just a few thousand votes in key battleground states like Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Arizona.\"In such a highly contested political context, neither candidate can afford to yield ground on any issue -- whether the economy, reproductive rights, immigration, democracy, or the rule of law,\" Cary Coglianese, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania, told Newsweek.Healthcare was identified as a main issue for about one in three voters each month. It placed second in the polls conducted in 2023, but has been in fourth place across the last several polls of 2024.Housing, the environment, taxation, and government spending are lower down, with between 10 and 20 percent of poll respondents seeing them as a top concern.Other concerns that saw minor declines across the polling include foreign policy, Covid, and policing and crime.\"The attempt by both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to diminish the surging importance of immigration initially succeeded but ultimately failed, with immigration moving from a clear second earlier this year to fourth in terms of importance over the summer before recovering to being virtually tied with abortion for second, Philip van Scheltinga, director of research at Redfield & Wilton Strategies, told Newsweek.\"The Harris campaign has had some success in accentuating the issue of abortion, particularly among female and young voters. However, while abortion is now the most important issue for Harris voters, slightly above the economy, the primacy of this issue has not quite registered for the rest of the voting public and the swing voters who will decide this election.\"Both Harris and Trump have offered opposing views on abortion this campaign.Harris and the Democrats have made maintaining abortion rights and reproductive healthcare a key campaign pledge.In a recent appearance on the Call Her Daddy podcast, Harris told host Alex Cooper that the government shouldn't be telling women about their own reproductive rights.\"What's so outrageous about it is a bunch of these guys up in these state capitals are writing these decisions because they somehow have decided that they're in a better position to tell you what's in your best interest than you are to know what's in your own best interest,\" Harris said.Trump, meanwhile, has largely avoided the topic. He has said he wants abortion access to remain decided by individual states, repeatedly taking credit for the overturning of Roe v. Wade, having nominated three conservative justices on the Supreme Court bench who voted to quash the landmark abortion legislation in June 2022. He has denied he would sign a national abortion ban if he returned to the White House.Issues over reproductive rights will also be on the ballots in 10 states in November, including where abortion is now largely banned post-Roe v. Wade.The latest poll, conducted in October, found that 20 percent of 2024 Trump supporters view abortion as a key election issue, compared to 58 percent of Harris supporters.Silvina Alarcón, political director for abortion rights non-profit Reproductive Freedom for All, told Newsweek: \"Decisions about whether or when to start or grow our families should be our own to make. This issue matters to voters, and with Trump and MAGA Republicans' abortion bans threatening voters' lives and well-being, it will be top of mind as they head to the ballot box.\"The contrast between the two campaigns, and what they seek to do when they take office, is clear.\"The polling shows that economic concerns remain paramount for voters across all demographics, including every age bloc, male and female voters, and whether they intend on backing Harris or Trump in November.Christopher Borick, a professor of political science and the director of polling organization at the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion in Pennsylvania, said that economic issues are \"perpetually one of the most salient\" for Americans in elections, and that the recent decades-high levels of inflation intensified these concerns.Trump positions himself as the candidate most trusted to handle economic issues, recalling a strong economy during his presidency.\"Trump has an easier sell on the matter, laying the blame on the current administration and offering a change of direction,\" Borrick told Newsweek.\"Harris has had to navigate a more challenging terrain, promoting the robust economic performance achieved during her tenure as VP, including declining inflation, while selling a new direction on economic policy that includes targeted tax breaks and subsidies to help the middle class attain goods such as homes that have been out of reach because of inflationary pressures.\"Harris can take solace in the economy largely improving in the run-up to the election.Gas prices have fallen, and inflation dropped to a three-year low of 2.5 percent in August. The current unemployment rate has also fallen to near historic lows of 4.1 percent, with the 254,000 jobs added to the labor market in September going way beyond estimations.The polling results also highlight generational differences in issue prioritization.Immigration appears to gain importance the older voters get. Around one-quarter of Gen Z (those aged 18-26) and Millennials (aged 27-42) listed it among their main issues, whereas it was regularly cited by almost half of those in the Boomer generation (aged 59 to 75.)Roughly a fifth to a quarter of Gen Z and Millennial voters regularly place housing among their top election issues. In comparison, the polling shows only around one in 10 of the Boomer generation will take housing into account when they cast their vote in November.",

The former Governor, wearing his trademark Navy hat, appeared with local leaders and other members of Congress.Each has also tried to take credit for pushing policies that led to speedy recoveries in the state. DeSantis said during a news conference in Fort Pierce after Milton, \"We never did the pre-staging of power assets until I became Governor. Now people expect that, but that wasn't what was done in the past.\"Not so, Scott argued. In a social media post two days after Milton roared onshore, he noted that utility companies had \"pre-staged tens of thousands of lineworkers, trucks and assets\" during Hurricanes Irma and Michael.\"St. Pete starts insurance process for Hurricane Milton-ravaged Tropicana Field\" via Henry Queen of the Tampa Bay Business Journal -- St. Petersburg has submitted a claim with its insurance carrier on the city-owned Tropicana Field, which Milton damaged considerably. The cost and timeline of replacing the roof -- which was torn off by Milton's 100 mph winds -- are uncertain. National baseball analyst Jim Bowden suggested a new roof would cost upward of $100 million. The Tampa Bay Times reported that \"the only thing that seems certain\" is that the stadium won't be ready for the start of the Tampa Bay Rays' 2025 season. St. Pete's insurance adjuster has performed an initial on-site inspection. The city also recently hired Hennessy Construction Services and AECOM Hunt to conduct a complete building analysis -- structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing and architectural -- and has retained Global Rope Access to remove the remaining roof material.\"Best guess if insurance is insufficient at the Trop? The Orlando Rays\" via John Romano of the Tampa Bay Times -- Have we seen the last ballgame at the Trop? Nothing has been decided, but the future is bleak. The damage wrought by Hurricane Milton is significant, and the cost to repair a stadium already slated for demolition by 2028 may prove to be immense. Engineers, architects, contractors, adjusters, and consultants will weigh in in the coming days, and attorneys will likely have their say, too. Eventually, the decision will come down to this: How much will it cost to repair, how much is insurance kicking in, and how much can the city of St. Petersburg afford, considering all the other expenses incurred following back-to-back hurricanes? Considering the deductible and their expenses elsewhere, it doesn't seem likely the city would choose to repair the stadium if the bill exceeded $47 million, leaving St. Pete on the hook for additional costs.\"It could take Volusia County until the year's end to clear Hurricane Milton debris\" via Sheldon Gardner of the Daytona Beach News-Journal -- One of the most visible reminders of Hurricane Milton's wrath is the storm debris piled up at curbs around the county -- and it's likely to hang around for a while. In the wake of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, many debris haulers are already at work in North Carolina, Georgia and Florida. So, Volusia County government officials are using their forces to help contractors clear debris in the unincorporated areas and along county-maintained roads, county spokesperson Michael Ryan said. \"Because of this shortage of resources and the sheer volume of debris, it could take until the end of the year,\" he said.\"Donald Trump attempts to troll Kamala Harris by serving french fries at a Pennsylvania McDonald's\" via Henry J. Gomez and Jake Traylor of NBC News -- Trump served up french fries Sunday at a Philadelphia-area McDonald's, oversalting spuds and peppering in some jabs at Harris. The franchise in Feasterville was closed for regular business during Sunday's photo op. The customers who went through the drive-thru were preselected by the franchise and the local Trump campaign team, according to a person familiar with the event. According to the source, the cars were also screened and searched, and the people were wanded down. The campaign visit in the critical battleground state just over two weeks from Election Day was designed to troll Harris, who talked about working at one of the fast-food chain's restaurants when she was younger. Without evidence, Trump has accused Harris of lying about the experience to improve her working-class credibility. Trump repeated his unsubstantiated claims Sunday.\"The voter gender gap is growing, and Harris' abortion rights campaign could make it even wider\" via Elena Schneider and Myah Ward of POLITICO -- When one of Harris' pollsters asked a small group of women in a focus group in February to describe Trump's position on abortion, most said they thought he was \"pro-choice.\" But then the pollster, working for Harris and President Joe Biden when he was still atop the ticket, played a clip of Trump saying \"there should be some form of punishment\" for women who have an abortion. The response in the room was visceral. \"That felt like a dagger,\" one of the women said. To Molly Murphy, the pollster who led the focus group of undecided voters, the scene was strikingly familiar to what she saw in the aftermath of Roe v. Wade's overturning in June 2022. Women, upon discovering how Republicans talked about abortion, largely recoiled. The issue powered Democrats to a better-than-expected showing in the midterms in 2022. Harris is banking on Trump's position on abortion to persuade women to push the gender gap in the election even wider.\"Harris' innovative media strategy shouldn't end on Election Day\" via Jennifer Rubin of The Washington Post -- Over the past two weeks, Harris has redefined presidential campaign media strategy. She has forced large media organizations to pay attention to under-covered topics, broadened the range of outlets to discuss substantive policy ideas, and helped crystallize Fox News's status as a purely partisan platform, not a news organization. You may have noticed that mainstream cable TV news, print and online outlets have dramatically increased the number and depth of stories focused on Trump's mental deterioration and authoritarian politics. So, what triggered the intensifying coverage? Harris. Harris routinely describes her opponent as \"unsteady\" and \"unstable.\" Rather than hector the media for not doing a better job, Harris simply compelled the major outlets covering her appearances to cover what she wanted to discuss: Trump's unfitness.\"Inside Trump's sleepless, exhausting mad dash to Election Day\" via Marc A. Caputo of The Bulwark -- In the 18 days since the beginning of October, Trump has held at least 28 in-person public events in 25 cities spread across 12 states on both coasts, according to a review of his public schedule and press accounts. And because Trump also likes to sleep in his own bed (usually in Mar-a-Lago), the campaign often flies in and out in a day and seldom spends 48 hours away from Florida. That adds extra sleepless hours on the campaign trail. So, too, does Trump's penchant for calling confidants or posting on Truth Social well after midnight. But the high-octane, no-sleep-till-Election-Day pace has come at a cost for the 78-year-old Trump.-- \"24 reasons that Trump could win\" via Nate Silver of the Silver Bulletin-- \"The very real scenario where Trump loses and takes power anyway\" via Kyle Cheney, Heidi Przybyla, John Sakellariadis and Lisa Kashinsky of POLITICO\"Pro-Trump group funded by Elon Musk struggles with outreach targets\" via Rachael Levy and Alexandra Ulmer of Reuters -- The political action committee funded by billionaire Musk to help re-elect Trump is struggling in some swing states to meet door knocking goals and is investigating claims that some canvassers lied about the number of voters they have contacted, according to people involved in the group's efforts. The difficulties, in pivotal battleground states including Wisconsin and Nevada, come as the group America PAC races to enlist voters behind the Republican candidate in the final two weeks before the Nov. 5 election. Four people involved in the group's outreach told Reuters that managers warned canvassers they are missing targets and needed to raise the number of would-be voters they contact.\"Musk's daily $1 million giveaway to registered voters could be illegal, experts say\" via Marshall Cohen of CNN -- While stumping for Trump, Musk announced that he will give away $1 million each day to registered voters in battleground states, immediately drawing scrutiny from election law experts who said the sweepstakes could violate laws against paying people to register. \"We want to try to get over a million, maybe 2 million voters in the battleground states to sign the petition in support of the First and Second Amendment. ... We are going to be awarding $1 million randomly to people who have signed the petition, every day, from now until the election,\" Musk said. He was referring to a petition launched by his political action committee affirming support for the rights to free speech and to bear arms. The website, launched shortly before some registration deadlines, says, \"this program is exclusively open to registered voters in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina.\" Musk speaks as Trump looks on during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Oct. 5, 2024. Musk, the richest man in the world, has given more than $75 million to his pro-Trump super PAC\"How Republican billionaires learned to love Trump again\" via Susan B. Glasser of The New Yorker -- In February, the billionaire investor Nelson Peltz convened two dozen of the country's wealthiest Republicans for dinner at Montsorrel, his $300-million oceanfront estate in Palm Beach, just down the road from Mar-a-Lago. During the 2020 campaign, Peltz hosted a lavish fundraiser for Trump at the mansion, which took in $10 million. But, in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, Peltz, like many Republicans of all income levels, had publicly denounced the President. In an interview with CNBC on Jan. 7, he apologized for his vote and said that Trump would always be remembered for that day's \"disgrace.\" \"As an American,\" he added, \"I'm embarrassed.\"\"How tech billionaires became the GOP's new donor class\" via Jonathan Mahler, Ryan Mac and Theodore Schleifer of The New York Times -- Throughout this election cycle, a group of these men have coalesced around a new mission: putting Trump back in the White House. They are the Republican Party's ascendant donor class and operate on a very different plane from the donors who preceded them. They have a seemingly limitless amount of money to help make this vision a reality and their own media profiles and platforms to use. They are the opposite of private, dark-money donors, who publicly support Trump and sometimes announce their donations on social media. It's an ambitious and highly motivated group, powered by self-interest and self-regard.\"Trump fixates on Arnold Palmer as 'all man' in showers during profane rally\" via Marianne LeVine and Isaac Arnsdorf of The Washington Post -- Seventeen days from the election, here in arguably the most decisive swing state, Trump spent the first 10 minutes of his speech without mentioning politics. Instead, he delivered a lengthy tribute to Palmer, the late golfer born here and the airport's namesake where Trump spoke. Trump's soliloquy about Palmer included how other athletes reacted to seeing him in the showers. \"Arnold Palmer was all man. And I say that in all due respect to women and I love women. But this guy, this guy, this is a guy that was all man. This man was strong and tough. And I refused to say it, but when he took showers with the other pros, they came out of there, they said, 'Oh my God, that's unbelievable,'\" Trump said.\"Harris says Trump's behavior 'demeans' the presidency after vulgar remarks\" via Katie Rogers of The New York Times -- In an interview on Sunday with the Rev. Al Sharpton, Harris responded to a profanity-laden insult that Trump used about her tenure as Vice President, saying he had \"not earned the right\" to hold office again. \"The American people deserve so much better,\" she told Sharpton on his show. She later added, \"Donald Trump should never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States. He has not earned the right. He has not earned the right. And that's why he's going to lose.\" Sharpton had asked her to react to \"street talk from someone who wants to be President,\" referring to a rally Trump held in Pennsylvania a day earlier. After he descended to new levels of vulgarity with remarks about the late golfer Palmer, Trump encouraged his audience to yell profane words to describe the Biden-Harris administration and added his own.\"A tattooed union leader is threatening to topple a Republican Senator in a deep-red state\" via Kristina Peterson and Anthony DeBarros of The Wall Street Journal -- Dan Osborn was campaigning for a U.S. Senate seat last week when he jumped onto the back of a white pickup parked outside a labor hall, a buck knife holstered on his hip and a tattoo sleeve running down his right arm. What began as his long shot bid to unseat two-term Republican Sen. Deb Fischer has become a tight race in deep-red Nebraska, a state that Trump won by 19 percentage points in 2020. Between swigs from a green Gatorade water bottle, the 49-year-old former union leader and political independent reminisced to a crowd north of 150 people about his role in running the 2021 strike at Kellogg's Omaha plant. Standing by his side was United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, who led a historic strike that won significant wage increases for autoworkers last year. \"I didn't see men or women or Black or White or Republican or Democrat on the picket line,\" Osborn said. \"I just saw people that wanted to go to work for a fair wage and some good benefits.\"Scott launches new Creole ad in South Florida -- Scott is running a new radio ad in Creole for the Miami, Broward, and Palm Beach markets featuring former Florida Democrat Senate candidate Dr. Rod Joseph. In the ad, Joseph explains why today's Democrat Party does not align with the values of Florida's Haitian community. He also explains why he left the Democrat Party and endorsed Scott for re-election.\"Colorado Gov. Jared Polis stumps for Harris in South Florida\" via Drew Dixon of Florida Politics -- The Democratic leader from the Rocky Mountain State headlined the \"Out for Harris\" effort in South Florida for the weekend. Polis joined Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried and HD 106 candidate Joe Saunders to rally LGBTQ+ voters in Miami. They discussed Harris' campaign objectives and her vice-presidential candidate, Tim Walz. The South Florida effort also juxtaposed the Democratic message with Trump's and the arch-conservative plan, the so-called 2025 Project. \"I was thrilled to join energized Floridians working to help elect Kamala Harris as our next President of the United States. Florida and Colorado are voting for Kamala on Nov. 5 because we know she has our back, she will defend our freedom, expand opportunity for all and save people money,\" said Polis in a news release.\"'It's time': Gordon Smith after years enforcing weed laws urges legalizing recreation pot\" via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics -- The Bradford County Sheriff grabbed attention when he publicly endorsed legalizing marijuana. He went a step further and cut an ad urging voters to pass an amendment decriminalizing pot for adult use. \"No one has arrested more people for marijuana than me,\" Smith said in a new Smart & Safe Florida ad, \"so when I say it's time to stop ruining lives over marijuana, it's time.\" In the 30-second ad, Smith asserts the current system destroys too many people's lives by bringing consequences for using marijuana.\"DeSantis battles his onetime top ally in a bid to stop marijuana legalization in Florida\" via Matt Dixon and Allan Smith of NBC News -- The last time DeSantis fought Trump, he had one of the most influential operatives in Republican politics punching alongside him. But now, as Trump lines up against DeSantis in a battle over a high-profile ballot initiative to legalize marijuana in Florida, the Governor's old ally, Jeff Roe, is working against him. The renowned GOP operative, whose reputation is built on a one-stop political firm that brings in tens of millions of dollars for each election cycle, once led Never Back Down, a super PAC that backed DeSantis' Presidential Primary campaign. The relationship, however, soured after DeSantis' presidential ambitions went up in flames. Now, roughly a year after that blowup, Roe is on the verge of potentially getting the 60% voter approval needed to add the legalization of recreational marijuana to the Florida constitution, something DeSantis has forcefully opposed and spent significant sums of money.-- \"Smoke shops sprout like weeds in Florida. You'll be surprised at what one owner says about marijuana legalization bill.\" via Rob Hurtibise of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel\"Fact or fiction? Critics say Amendment 3 will make Florida smell like weed\" via Claire Healy of the Miami Herald -- As voters decide whether to legalize recreational marijuana in Florida this November, DeSantis and opponents of Amendment 3 are focusing on a specific concern: the smell. \"It's basically a license to have it anywhere you want,\" DeSantis said. \"This state will start to smell like marijuana in our cities and towns. It will reduce the quality of life.\" It's an appeal to Floridians' senses. Pushed not only by the Governor but also by the Florida Chamber of Commerce and the official campaign against the amendment -- Vote No on 3 -- the warning is predicated on two claims. First, the language of the amendment prevents laws that restrict outdoor use and that states with recreational cannabis have already been overwhelmed. In commercials produced by the Vote No on 3 campaign, speakers claiming to be from Colorado and California -- states with legal markets -- say they're fed up. \"I'm at the park with my and they're like, 'Mommy, what's that smell?'\" a woman says into the camera. \"California has gone to s-t.\" Only proponents of Amendment 3 say it will be easy to regulate in Florida.Happening Wednesday -- Smart & Safe Florida will make a campaign announcement alongside the American Association of Senior Citizens, Florida Alliance for Retired Americans and Florida For Care: 11 a.m., Brownwood Hotel, 3003 Brownwood Blvd., The Villages.

The amendment, sponsored by Floridians Protecting Freedom, would enshrine abortion into the state's constitution. It would allow for the practice to be done up until the point of \"viability,\" which the Governor previously said is a non-definable time in the pregnancy that abortion providers can easily abuse. The Governor said Florida has \"the strongest protections for parents' rights, but Amendment 4 would change that.\" He noted that he previously signed legislation to \"defend the rights of mothers and fathers to be involved in medical decisions concerning their own children.\"\"Woman featured in abortion rights ad speaks out after state tried to get it off the air\" via Gabrielle Russon of Florida Politics -- The woman, known only as Caroline, was thrust into a First Amendment legal fight with the state over a pro-abortion rights political ad spoke to reporters. Caroline shared her story about having an abortion in 2022 during her second trimester after she was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. \"All I wanted to do was leave the Neuro-ICU and go home to my almost 2-year-old girl,\" Caroline said. \"It was the hardest decision that I have ever made in my life, but I chose to end my pregnancy and prepare for radiation that next day. My abortion allowed me more time to be a mother to my daughter and a wife to my husband.\"\"As Floridians vote on abortion rights, opponents plan court battle to void results\" via Skyler Swisher and Jeffrey Schweers of the Orlando Sentinel -- Abortion rights advocates spent months and millions of dollars gathering petition signatures so Florida voters could decide if they want abortion to be protected now that Roe v. Wade has been overturned. They got the measure on the Nov. 5 ballot, and hundreds of thousands of Floridians voting by mail already have said yes or no to Amendment 4, the abortion question. But an eleventh-hour lawsuit filed Wednesday by anti-abortion opponents threatens to derail their efforts. The lawsuit, heavily based on a report from DeSantis' administration and pushed by his allies, alleges \"widespread fraud\" in the abortion petition drive and seeks to strike Amendment 4 from the ballot -- or nullify any election results. After so much effort and time, could Amendment 4 really go by the wayside, regardless of what the voters want? It seems at least possible, a suggestion that deepens the extraordinary political and legal morass into which the abortion rights measure has been cast.\"Thomas Chalifoux still holds cash edge on Darren Soto, but only through self-funding\" via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics -- The only Democrat in the delegation targeted by the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) trails his opponent in cash on hand. U.S. Rep. Soto closed the third quarter with about $506,000 available compared to nearly $1.8 million for Chalifoux. But that's primarily because of the challenger's out-of-pocket contributions. Chalifoux's campaign has reported more than $2.5 million in candidate loans. Soto raised almost $506,000 in donations last quarter, while Chalifoux reported about $27,000 in outside contributions during the same period. In his August-September report, Chalifoux reported putting another $517,000 in loans into his coffers, signaling a willingness to spend what it takes out-of-pocket to win the race.\"House rating analysis bumps CD 13 from 'leans' GOP to 'tilt' in good news for Dem challenger Whitney Fox\" via Janelle Irwin Taylor of Florida Politics -- A relatively new political analysis site, CNalysis, has shifted its forecast in the 2024 race for Florida's 13th Congressional District from \"leans\" Republican to \"tilt\" Republican, an improvement for Democratic candidate Fox who is challenging incumbent Republican Anna Paulina Luna. The shift was one of a handful the outlet made earlier this week, including races in Alabama, Alaska, California, New York and Pennsylvania. The site now gives Luna a 6 in 10 chance of winning re-election over Fox. The shift puts CD 13 in CNalysis' list of most competitive races and aligns with recent trends in the race that have shifted in Fox's favor while still giving Luna the edge.\"GOP support for indicted Carolina Amesty may be waning in tight Orlando-area race\" via Annie Martin of the Orlando Sentinel -- Former Disney executive and political newcomer Leonard Spencer is challenging Rep. Amesty, a former up-and-comer facing criminal charges. Amesty, a first-term Republican house member, is coming off an indictment on four felony charges related to the alleged forgery of a man's signature on an employment form she notarized as an administrator for her family's small school. Two years ago, her campaign made a splash as Amesty lent $200,000 to her own war chest, drew an endorsement from Donald Trump Jr., and touted her experience as a vice president for Central Christian University and an entrepreneur who ran a successful chicken restaurant. This year, her campaign has been noticeably quieter.\"Another conviction in Florida's ghost candidate scandal, but the Senators who benefited remain in office\" via Scott Maxwell of the Orlando Sentinel -- Former GOP State Sen. Frank Artiles became the fifth person to either be convicted or plead out to crimes in a statewide scandal that was exposed by Florida news outlets back when state officials were twiddling their thumbs. Yet the Senators who benefited from this criminal scheme remain in office. So, what kind of justice is that? Republican State Sens. Jason Brodeur of Seminole County and Ileana Garcia of Miami are still in office, making laws -- even though multiple people broke laws to help get them there. South Florida Democrat José Javier Rodríguez described the convictions as \"a measure of justice.\" I think that's exactly right. It's only \"a measure\" because the people who benefited from the crimes still enjoy the spoils.\"C student? Middling marks for DeSantis fiscal policy from libertarian Cato Institute\" via A.G. Gancarski of Florida Politics -- DeSantis' storied Free State of Florida falls in the middle of the pack regarding fiscal policy. And tax gimmicks are the reason why, claims libertarian think tank The Cato Institute, giving the Sunshine State's chief executive a Gentleman's C. Temporary tax breaks strike the scholars as performative half-measures, essentially, despite Florida being the \"second freest state\" in its reckoning. \"DeSantis approved a temporary reduction in the corporate tax rate and a bill to avoid business tax increases related to the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. DeSantis has frequently signed legislation providing temporary tax breaks, including annual sales tax holidays, rebates, a gas tax suspension and similar breaks. Using budget surpluses for temporary tax breaks has reduced funds available for spending, but it would have been better to enact permanent tax reforms.\"\"The U.S. is investigating an unauthorized release of classified documents on Israel's attack plans\" via Zeke Miller, Mike Balsamo, Eric Tucker, and Tara Copp of The Associated Press -- The United States is investigating an unauthorized release of classified documents that assess Israel's plans to attack Iran. A fourth U.S. official said the documents appear to be legitimate. The documents are attributed to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency and note that Israel was still moving military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response to Iran's blistering ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1. They were shareable within the \"Five Eyes,\" which are the U.S., Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.\"Sen. Lindsey Graham on Republicans supporting Harris: 'What the hell are you doing?\" via Sarah Fortinsky of The Hill -- Sen. Graham on Sunday questioned Republicans who take issue with Trump's \"rhetoric\" and have decided to back Harris' bid instead. \"To every Republican supporting her, what the hell are you doing? You're supporting the most radical nominee in the history of American politics,\" Graham said,\" naming progressive policies the Vice President once backed -- including \"Medicare for All\" and the Green New Deal. Graham called Harris the \"border czar\" and referred to the Vice President's previous statement touting that she was the last person in the room with Biden before he decided to withdraw from Afghanistan. He also noted she cast the tiebreaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act.Happening today -- U.S. Reps.

They're still waiting.\" via Deborah Sontag of The New York Times -- On Valentine's Day 2018, Bruna Oliveira's geography teacher was shot dead at her feet as he ushered students into his classroom to shield them from an approaching gunman. When the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland occurred, Oliveira's Brazilian family was living temporarily in the United States with no intention of staying. Advised that the government offers a special visa to victims of serious crime who are helpful to law enforcement, Oliveira and 74 other survivors of the massacre applied for what is known as a U visa. Little did they know then that the well-intentioned U visa program is among the most dysfunctional in the whole troubled immigration apparatus, with benefits far more delayed than those of the notoriously backlogged asylum program.\"Big changes coming as Jupiter, Boca Raton voters get ready to choose new School Board members\" via Katherine Kokal of the Palm Beach Post -- Voters in the Jupiter and the Boca Raton areas will choose School Board members this Election Day. Those two candidates will join one already declared winner to fuel the most significant turnover on Palm Beach County's School Board in recent memory. Three incumbent Board members chose not to seek re-election this year, leaving the races open for new interest. In Jupiter, a three-candidate Primary in August produced two finalists when no one garnered 50% or more of the vote. Family lawyer Matthew Lane will face Page Lewis, a literacy coach, in the race for the Jupiter and Palm Beach Gardens area seat previously held by Barbara McQuinn.\"'You need boots to live here or a boat': King tides are swamping Miami streets again\" via Alex Harris of the Miami Herald -- Water bubbled up from the asphalt on a bayfront street in Miami Shores. It surged up through a drain, covering the entire street in just a few hours despite a perfectly clear sky. Saturday marked the peak of this season's king tide, the year's highest tide. Salty water crept into streets and yards across South Florida and along the East Coast, offering a glimpse of a near future with a higher sea level. Rigobert Merisier's usual parking spot -- above a street drain -- was covered with a few inches of water when he returned to the grocery store Saturday morning. Merisier said he's fed up with the flooding and rising living costs in his neighborhood. A condemned home at the end of the block, closer to the water, is for sale for more than $2 million. \"We're looking to get out of Miami altogether,\" he said.\"Kissimmee deputy police chief faced firing for homophobic remark about lesbian officer\" via Cristóbal Reyes of the Orlando Sentinel -- A Kissimmee deputy police chief who decided to retire last month was facing termination for making a homophobic remark about a female officer seeking a promotion. And it wasn't the first time Camille Alicea, considered a trailblazer among Hispanics in Central Florida's law enforcement community, was accused of making homophobic comments. But records provided to the Sentinel this week in response to a public records request offer no indication she was previously investigated or disciplined for allegedly doing so. That changed earlier this year, after Alicea was accused of suggesting a fellow officer was being promoted \"because she is a lesbian female.\" Alicea was suspended, and an investigation corroborated the accusation.\"Marion County voters to consider half-cent sales tax for school construction, improvements\" via Austin L. Miller of the Ocala Star-Banner -- People already are returning mail ballots and early voting starts Oct. 21. One of the questions on the Nov. 5 General Election ballot concerns schools: a proposed half-cent sales tax that would last for 10 years. The tax revenue would help the School District build, replace and improve school infrastructure. There are 50 schools in the School District. (That does not include charter or private schools.) The 50 schools serve more than 46,000 students and have a combined budget of $1.3 billion. According to the Ocala Metro Chamber & Economic Partnership (CEP), school enrollment has increased by more than 11% in the past five years.\"In Polk Election Supervisor race, well-funded Melony Bell takes on incumbent Lori Edwards\" via Gary White of The Lakeland Ledger -- As a three-term incumbent, Rep. Bell could have felt confident of winning a fourth and final term in the Florida House. Instead, Bell decided to challenge one of the longest-serving elected officials in Polk County. Bell is taking on Polk Supervisor of Elections Edwards, who has served since 2001 and hopes to win a seventh term. The race abounds with intriguing elements. For the first time since 1996, the Supervisor of Elections race is a partisan contest, and Bell has gained endorsements from prominent Republicans. While Edwards has the advantages of incumbency and high name recognition, Bell is also well known, having served as a Polk County Commissioner for eight years before heading to Tallahassee. Bell has also compiled a substantial edge in campaign funding.\"Man who vowed to ride out Florida hurricanes on his boat is arrested in Tampa\" via The Associated Press -- The man who gained social media fame with TikTok posts as he was riding out two hurricanes in his boat has been arrested in Tampa, Florida. Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office arrest records show Joseph Malinowsky, 54, known as \"Lt. Dan\" after his TikTok posts, was arrested Friday for trespassing and failure to appear in court on previous charges of operating an unregistered vehicle and having no valid driver's license. Malinowsky rejected pleas from officials to seek shelter and instead remained in his boat during Hurricanes Helene and Milton. Malinowsky, whose nickname comes from a character in the movie \"Forrest Gump\" who rides out a hurricane in a boat, remained jailed Saturday.\"Spectrum TV news outlets in Tampa and Orlando outperform other stations during Milton\" via Drew Dixon of Florida Politics -- When natural disasters, such as recent hurricanes, cause havoc in Florida communities; those are times when residents turn to broadcast news outlets often for the most up-to-date breaking bulletins to keep them informed and possibly save lives. Spectrum news outlets in both Tampa and Orlando appear to have come out on top compared to the competitors during Hurricane Milton when it slammed Florida first on the Gulf Coast on Oct. 9 and then roared through the interior of the state before it exited into the Atlantic Ocean through the Space Coast on Oct. 10. When the powerful hurricane first struck the West Coast of Florida, Spectrum Bay News 9 in Tampa saw the most viewers from Oct. 7 when the storm was bearing down on the state through Oct. 9 the day the storm plowed into the Gulf Coast.\"George Soros talk brings antisemitism charge in Hillsborough State Attorney race\" via Dan Sullivan of the Tampa Bay Times -- For as long as Andrew Warren has been part of local politics, he's grappled with accusations that he received support from the liberal billionaire Soros. It's been a common line of attack from Warren's opponents but one he tends to ignore. Now, as he campaigns against Suzy Lopez in the November election, Warren has called out those criticisms as being antisemitic. In a post on X earlier this month, Warren accused Lopez of \"false, antisemitic attacks.\" Many Jewish people and researchers on hate and extremism consider attacks like this against Soros, who is Jewish and a proficient fundraiser, as an antisemitic dog whistle.-- \"Money pours into Hillsborough state attorney campaigns. Here's who's giving.\" via Dan Sullivan of the Tampa Bay Times\"'Easy as possible': Elections Supervisor encourages people to vote early starting Monday\" via Jeff Burlew of the Tallahassee Democrat -- Leon County Supervisor of Elections Mark Earley is encouraging people to vote early in the Nov. 5 General Election. Early voting kicks off Monday, Oct. 21, and runs through Sunday, Nov. 3, at 10 different locations across the county. \"I want every Leon County voter to have every opportunity to cast their ballot,\" Earley said. \"This is why we offer the maximum days of Early Voting allowed under Florida law.

Her statement came after a host of local and state Republican officials called on her to apologize because of the connection that concentration camps have to the Nazi death camps that killed millions during World War II. \"Anyone who knows me has listened to me speak or watched my actions knows I would never diminish the awfulness and horror that was the Holocaust,\" she said in a statement. \"That was not my intention.

One of the tornadoes touched down in North Fort Myers and destroyed or damaged about 200 homes along U.S. 41. Storm experts with the National Weather Service in Ruskin were in the Fort Myers area Friday assessing the damage. Still, the details -- such as top wind speed and distance traveled -- are not yet available. \"They are likely going to add two, maybe three additional tornadoes (in their coverage area),\" said NWS meteorologist Ali Davis out of Ruskin, the office that covers the Fort Myers-Lee County area. \"Now they're looking at whether or not this was a continuation or multiple tornadoes.\" Davis said meteorologists are comparing images they captured during the storm to those seen at tornado sites.\"Yep, the media should cover Trump's age more -- and Joe Biden's too\" via Nate Silver of the Silver Bulletin. Progressives have recently pushed another issue of Trump's age and cognitive fitness.Philosophically, though, I support the effort to press the media on this story. Trump is 78 and is seeking the presidency until he's 82. That's way too old, given the demands of the job. Considering the long history of old Presidents seeking to hold on to power when they were clearly diminished -- there were many such cases before Trump and Biden -- we should probably just have a constitutional amendment that says a President can't be older than 75 on Inauguration Day.The problem is that if Trump assumes office again, he'll be essentially the same age as Biden at the start of his term. (Trump would be 78 years and 220 days old on Inauguration Day; Biden was 78 years and 61 days old in 2021.) And there's an extremely high overlap between people who critique the media for not covering Trump's age enough and those who scold it for covering Biden's age too much.As someone who was an early and frequent critic of Biden's decision to run for another term, I have no such risk of hypocrisy, so I say, go for it.However, if the media should cover Trump's age more, it should probably still cover Biden's age more. He may not be a candidate for President anymore, but he's the leader of the free world in a dangerous time facing multiple simultaneous crises from Ukraine to the Middle East. After the June debate, numerous accounts, even from friendly sources, indicated that Biden has limited uptime and is not consistently at his best.Biden is keeping a very light public schedule. How effective is he at handling these, or if something even worse happens?-- OPINIONS --\"The questions Harris can't answer\" via Ramesh Ponnuru of The Washington Post -- Why does Harris have so much trouble answering questions that are predictably coming her way, and even after multiple attempts? In her interview this week with Fox News anchor Bret Baier, she was evasive when asked about immigration, how she would govern differently from Biden and her perceptions of Biden's fitness over time. She hasn't offered explanations for her many flip-flops on the issues, either. The likeliest reason neither she nor her advisers have devised better answers is that there are no politically palatable ones. After immigration, Baier turned to Harris' past support for taxpayer-funded sex-change surgeries for prisoners and detained immigrants who are in the country illegally. Now that she is in a General Election campaign where that stance is a liability, she wants to downplay it without angering progressives who regard such surgeries as a non-negotiable human right.\"Pity poor Renatha Francis and her terrible burden of always knowing what's best\" via Pat Beall of the Orlando Sentinel -- Picked from judicial obscurity by DeSantis to sit on the Florida Supreme Court for no apparent reason at all, Francis' lack of experience alone should have been disqualifying. A graduate of a for-profit law school that was eventually shuttered amid criticism of academic standards and federal loan management, Francis spent most of the next several years as a law clerk and appeals court staff attorney when Scott appointed her to a Miami-Dade County judgeship in 2017. She served only one year on the county bench before Scott elevated her to a Miami-Dade Circuit Court judgeship. She spent just one year there before DeSantis made her a Palm Beach County Circuit judge. She had been a judge for roughly four years when DeSantis first decided she had the experience and intellect to hold a state Supreme Court seat. Because she had not been a Florida Bar member for 10 years, as required, the nomination failed. DeSantis successfully renominated her in 2022.\"Michael Carlson: The truth behind closed property insurance claims\" via Florida Politics -- The narrative being created, based in part on an article citing data from Hurricane Ian claims, overlooks a key issue: much of the damage from Ian was caused by storm surge, which is generally not covered by a standard homeowners insurance policy. The result is that consumers are being misled into believing flood claims are covered and denied by insurers without proper justification. There is a timely and even more important reason why a property claim may be closed without payment: if the claim is for damage caused by storm surge or local flooding, it is generally not covered. Many consumers do not know that their standard homeowner's policy excludes flood damage. If they file a claim for damages caused by flooding, it will be appropriately denied, and the claim will be closed without payment. Critics of the insurance industry should apply their efforts to educate consumers on flood insurance's importance and value and provide information that will enhance recovery efforts.\"'It's Florida, Man' review: HBO's star-studded collection of sunshine state misadventures could stand to be quirkier\" via Daniel Feinberg of The Hollywood Reporter -- Debuting this Friday night at 11, It's Florida, Man may be the least eccentric and least experimental series that HBO has programmed in its end-of-week late-night hub. If there's anything less edgy than making fun of the wackiness of Florida and its misadventure-prone denizens, it's lining up a parade of recognizable guest stars to join in the campaign. But if TV watching and TV perception are habit-forming, how many HBO Sunday shows have been elevated to perceived prestige by their scheduling? -- maybe debuting a show this instantly accessible on Fridays at 11 will help train viewers to take an interest the next time Julio Torres does something genuinely surreal or subversive?\"Consumer spending on Halloween goods is racking up with weeks to go before the holiday\" via Drew Dixon of Florida Politics -- The National Retail Federation (NRF) says nearly half of American consumers have likely already bought some Halloween products in early October. Some 47% of American consumers said they'd likely buy some Halloween goods even before October, up from 37% a half-decade ago and 32% 10 years prior. \"With early Halloween shopping on the rise, Florida retailers are already stocked up and ready to meet the early demand,\" shared Scott Shalley, president and CEO of the Florida Retail Federation. \"Don't let last-minute Halloween shopping haunt you. Head to your favorite Florida retailers to hunt down the best candy, decorations, costumes, and other Halloween essentials.\" The amount of money consumers spend this year appears to be a notable chunk of change on Halloween. They likely will throw down about $103.63 on Halloween products. That is slightly down from 2023, when that figure was $108.24.",

But The Hulkster has his opinion as to how the 2024 presidential election is going to end up, and he's predicting a Trump landslide.The wrestling icon made a major splash when he spoke at the Republican National Convention, in which he endorsed the former president to \"let Trumpamania run again.\" Since then, Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, has been traveling across the country to promote his new beer brand, and has discovered through his travels that \"everybody's for Trump.\"\"So I hear what you're saying about the polls, and it's even-Steven, and it might be a close call, but let me tell you something, I don't believe the polls,\" Hogan said on Fox News's One Nation with Brian Kilmeade. \"It's going to be a landslide.

    "title": "Some Jewish voters in presidential swing states reconsider their longtime devotion to Democrats - The Boston Globe",
    "content": "\"The family that is my generation and older generations, I don't think anybody is voting for Harris, and we've never voted Republican, ever,\" Kaufman, 49, said, referring to Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. \"My sister has a Trump sign outside her house, and that is a huge shift.\"How big a shift? Surveys continue to find that most Jewish voters still support the Democratic ticket, and Kaufman acknowledges that she's an exception.Still, any shift could have enormous implications in Pennsylvania, where tens of thousands of votes decided the past two presidential elections. Many Jewish voters say the 2024 presidential election is like no other in memory, coming amid the growing fallout from Hamas' brutal attack on Israelis last year.Jews represent a sliver of the voting-age population in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, the so-called blue wall of states that Democrats have come to rely on in recent presidential elections. In a close election, they are a big enough constituency that the campaigns of Harris and Trump see the potential for any slippage to swing a close contest.That has forced Harris to walk a line between traditional Democratic constituencies with strong feelings about the war in Gaza, both Jews and Arab Americans -- balancing support for Israel with outrage over the deaths of Israeli and Palestinian civilians and destruction in the region. The Biden administration has been pressuring Israel to end its attacks, which continued last week with the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by Israeli troops.Trump has looked to exploit the opening among Jewish voters especially, saying Harris \" doesn't like \" Jewish people, Jews who don't vote for him \"need their head examined \" and that he'll be the \" best friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the White House.\"In the past, surveys have shown that Jews overwhelmingly vote Democratic. A Pew Research Center poll released last month found that about two-thirds of Jewish voters back Harris. In 2020, about 7 in 10 Jewish voters supported President Joe Biden, according to AP VoteCast.The question is whether that has changed, as Jews now see Israel's survival in a new light as its war with Hamas widens to Hezbollah and Iran.That has put a new focus on the relationship between Israel and the U.S., which continues to provide military aid. And many Jews say rising acts of antisemitism in the United States and anti-Israel protests sweeping across cities and college campuses -- including in Philadelphia -- have made them feel unsafe.In Pennsylvania, still fresh in many minds is a gunman absorbed by white supremacist ideology murdering 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018, the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.As Pennsylvania plays a central role in the election, many say they've never seen such outreach from campaigns as they have now.From Trump on down, Republicans are attempting to win over Jewish voters by highlighting a Democratic Party torn between its traditional and unconditional support for Israel and a growing faction that has accused Israel of war crimes in Gaza, called for Israel to unconditionally stop attacking Hamas, and demanded that the U.S. end its military support for Israel.For some Jews who typically vote Democratic, that has resonated.\"I think that there are folks who are reluctant Trump voters who feel scared as Jews in this country,\" said Jeremy Kazzaz, a Pittsburgh resident and Harris supporter.Kazzaz, however, said Harris has a long record of fighting antisemitism that is relatively unknown to many voters.He pointed out that the Biden administration tapped her husband, Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, to lead a task force to develop a strategy to fight antisemitism well before Hamas attacked Israel. Emhoff has been a key surrogate, campaigning in front of Jewish audiences in the Philadelphia suburbs and speaking at the groundbreaking of a new complex replacing Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue.Still, where Harris' supporters see strong support of Israel -- for instance, the Biden administration sent a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery to Israel, along with the troops needed to operate it -- others see conditional support.That includes Biden urging Israel not to hit Iran's nuclear program or oil fields. At the same time, Biden has stressed his administration's support for Israel and, in her remarks on the anniversary of Hamas' attack, Harris said she'll \"always ensure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself and that I will always work to ensure the safety and security of the Jewish people here and around the world.\"Steve Rosenberg, of Philadelphia, who voted for Trump in 2016 and then Biden in 2020, will vote for Trump in 2024. In large part, Rosenberg sees Biden's lifting of Trump-era sanctions on Iran as providing the cash for the Islamic Republic to finance a war against Israel. Trump imposed the sanctions after voiding a treaty the Obama administration had reached to slow Iran's progress toward nuclear weapons, which he called a bad deal.\"The question is, 'Who is better off today than four years ago?'\" Rosenberg said. \"And the answer is Iran and the mullahs and their proxies, and it's because Biden and Kamala Harris have capitulated to Iran.\"Kaufman, a self-described progressive who lives in Pittsburgh's heavily Jewish Squirrel Hill neighborhood, never thought she would vote for Trump.But now, she expects Trump will continue a hardline stance against Iran -- which she calls an imminent threat to democracy, human rights and western civilization -- and worries that Harris will appease Iran and pander to the party's left wing.Jews with very strong connections to Israel -- her parents were born there and her daughter just finished a two-year eight-month mandatory service with the Israeli army -- are similarly conflicted over supporting Harris, Kaufman said. \"I'm saying it out loud everywhere, but most people aren't saying it out loud.\"Many Jews who support Harris, however, say they see Trump as a threat to democracy.That's important, they say, because minorities -- including Jews -- have reason to fear persecution under dictators.They can unfurl a list of comments by Trump that they see as threatening: using the military against domestic enemies, peddling dual-loyalty tropes about Jews, setting up Jews as scapegoats if he loses and, in the days after Hamas' attack, criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while praising Hezbollah as \"very smart.\"Emhoff called Trump a \"known antisemite.\"Some see Trump's efforts on Jan. 6, 2021, to stay in power as a threat. Many are wary of his affinity for dictators, and bring up his dinner at his Mar-a-Lago resort with far-right activist Nick Fuentes and rapper Ye, two men known for spewing antisemitic rhetoric.\"That's the conversation that I'm having with Jews,\" said Rabbi Beth Janus of Philadelphia.Janus said Jews she knows are excited that a woman could be president and that she's married to a Jewish man.

    "content": "Trump serves disturbing message through McDonald's drive-thru window about whether he'll accept election resultJohn Bowden21 October 2024 at 6:08 amDonald Trump was in suburban Pennsylvania on Sunday where he attempted to come across as America's \"everyman\" president in a very modern way -- by working at McDonald's.Instead, the former president created a kind of strange spectacle as he stoked fears about election fraud while wearing an apron through the restaurant's drive-thru window. The scene that played out in the Feasterville neighborhood of the Lower Southampton Township, where the former president and his campaign took over a McDonald's franchise restaurant owned by one of his supporters.Follow our live coverage of 2024 US Election here.The roughly hour-long photo opp closed down the restaurant entirely. A sign on the door said that the restaurant would be closed Sunday until 4pm, after the president and his entourage had left. During the visit, Trump had an apron tied behind his back by a McDonald's cashier before he recieved a short demonstration of how to work the fry station and stuck his head through the drive-thru.Trump proceeded to hand out a number of orders through the drive-thru window on Sunday, chatting to supporters who were picking up their meals.As he took a question from a reporter through the drive-thru window, Trump once again resorted to baseless suggestions that the 2024 presidential election results would be tainted by fraud, a charge he and running mate JD Vance have repeated about the past presidential election.\"Will you accept the results of the election?\" asked a reporter.\"Yeah, sure, if it's a fair election,\" the apron-clad Trump declared, his head fully poking out of the drive-thru.Trump and his cronies spent months raising such claims in the aftermath of the 2020 election, but failed to win any of the legal challenges they filed against the final vote counts in the several states where the results were contested. Audits later failed to find any of the widespread fraud Trump claimed existed, and election officials roundly proclaimed the results to be accurate.Still, Trump would go on to repeat those claims for years, and he now looks poised to contest the results of the race again should he lose; whether it be through legal challenges or merely rhetoric.His past efforts to gin up a mob to interfere in the certification of the Electoral College results in 2021 led to Congress passing legislation that reformed how that process is carried out.",

    "content": "TASR brings a quick morning overview of the most important events seen in Slovakia on the previous day (Sunday, October 20): BRATISLAVA - Food prices are an issue that merit the attention from me as the Prime Minister and it's necessary to find ways together with food producers and retails to have the upcoming cuts in the VAT tax on essential foodstuffs from 10 percent to 5 percent translate also into lower prices, Prime Minister Robert Fico (Smer-SD) declared on TA3's discussion programme 'V politike' (In Politics) on Sunday. Fico called the existing talks with involved parties constructive, with more talks to come. He would prefer to arrive at a deal, but if that doesn't happen, he underlined that the state has many tools in its disposal to enforce its will. \"Unlike in the past, the state today possesses information. We know what the inputs of food producers are, at what prices they sell products to a retail chain and know how much does the product cost on the shelf. Based on that, some decision can be taken,\" warned Fico and added that he values a dialogue, so he wouldn't specify any potential measures at this stage. \"But I refuse to accept that slashing VAT from 10 percent to 5 percent on essential foods would be for naught. Then we didn't need to do it at all. We did it because we want to stabilise the prices at least a little bit in the range of foods important to people,\" explained the Prime Minister. BRATISLAVA - Speaking on TA3's discussion programme 'V politike' (In Politics) on Sunday, Prime Minister Robert Fico (Smer-SD) stated that he expects the Slovak Towns and Villages Association (ZMOS) to come up next year with a proposal of a reform that would tackle the \"persistent\" problem with the financing of small villages, although Fico doesn't wish to take away the right to their own representation from such local authorities. Fico reiterated that the Government had helped ZMOS by giving it €50 million, but he expects ZMOS to table a reform in return to facilitate the running of small villages. \"I'm not saying that we'd like to take away from the villages the right to have their own mayor or some representation but we can't probably preserve 2,700 district authorities in this quality, where each has a mayor, district office and a village council,\" he claimed and added that the needs of several villages could be served by a single office with a shared accountant. Such a project could be financed with the European money. BRATISLAVA - The health sector is ripe for a systemic reform, as money get lost in it inefficiently, SNS leader Andrej Danko and KDH chair Milan Majersky concurred on RTVS's discussion programme 'O 5 minut 12' (Five Minutes to Twelve) on Sunday. Danko repeatedly heaped criticism at ex-health minister Zuzana Dolinkova (Voice-SD). Both Danko and Majersky hope that the necessary measures will be unveiled by new Health Minister Kamil Sasko (Voice-SD), but Majersky added that the health portfolio must receive attention also from the Prime Minister. \"This can't remain the agenda of only a single governing political party. The Prime Minister must get personally involved to make sure that sufficient financial resources are routed to the health sector and a good consolidation is carried out,\" he said. Also broached was the issue of the House chair post, left vacant since the 2024 presidential election in April due to ongoing disagreements within the coalition as to which party should claim the post. Danko stated that he respects the fact that House Vice-chair Peter Ziga (Voice-SD) has been tasked with heading Parliament in a temporary capacity. \"Even though I harbour objections to him having full powers,\" he said. Majersky claimed that the fact Parliament hasn't had a proper chair for so long is an embarrassment to Slovakia. BRATISLAVA - The offer of salary growth extended to nurses and midwives is absolutely fair, Health Minister Kamil Sasko (Voice-SD) underlined in a video he posted on a social network on Sunday. Sasko reiterated that the nurses and midwives won't see the growth of their salaries slowed down at all. \"The offer I'm submitting guarantees that each and every one of you will have exactly the same conditions of salary growth as before the consolidation package was passed,\" Sasko addressed nurses and midwives in the video. \"The entire package that I've managed to negotiate won't apply to nurses and midwives only, but also to paramedics and other health professions.\" Sasko asked whether the salary growth of almost 10 percent at the times of hard consolidation can be a reason for the continuation of strike activities and pointed out that all these professions will get precisely the same salary hikes as promised back in 2022. BRATISLAVA - Twelve problematic bears have been liquidated in the north of Slovakia over the past nine days following the declaration of the emergency state in the wake of a fatal bear attack on a human near the village of Hybe (Zilina region), Environment Minister Tomas Taraba (SNS nominee) posted on a social network on Sunday. In Taraba's view, this proves that the legislation amended with a mind towards protecting the people from bear attacks is efficient and works well. \"It grants sufficient tools to relevant organisations without enabling uncontrollable and arbitrary culling of bears that would clash with Slovakia's commitments regarding the protection of endangered species,\" posted Taraba. am",

Former US President Trump used to be a crypto critic but in recent weeks adopted a much friendlier stance alongside the sector's emergence as an influential player in the 2024 presidential election through big donations to a political action committee.With the 2024 election hitting its homestretch, the leading pro-crypto super PAC has funneled a big chunk of its final donations to close House races as part of an effort to push candidates favorable to the group's agenda over the top.Fairshake, which has been one of the top spenders across any industry this election cycle, doled out nearly $29 million in September, according to Federal Election commission data released to the public on Sunday. Of that sum, $20 million went to two affiliated PACs -- $15 million to the Defend American Jobs PAC, a single-issue committee focused on cryptocurrency and blockchain policy that's favored Republicans, and $5 million to Protect Progress, which has only supported Democrats.The remaining $8.8 million spent by Fairshake last month mostly went to House races in New York, Nevada and California, according to FEC data compiled by crypto market and blockchain analyst James Delmore and verified by CNBC.Several of those races are considered toss-ups by the Cook Political Report. Among the recipients were Southern California Republicans David G. Valadao and Michael Garcia, who are both in tights contests to keep their seats. They've received $1.3 million and $1 million, respectively.\"The Fairshake donations to the California candidates in toss-up districts are important not only to get pro-crypto candidates elected in House seats that could go either way, but also because a lot of crypto companies are still located in California,\" Delmore said. \"California needs all of the pro-crypto politicians they can get.\"Additionally, Fairshake gave more than $1.9 million to Rep. Patrick Ryan (D-NY), over $1.7 million to Rep. Steven Horsford (D-Nev.) and almost $1 million to Rep. Angela Dawn Craig (D-Minn.). The remaining cash went to a mix of candidates in Illinois, Colorado, Oregon, Iowa and Arkansas.Of the House donations, $6.2 million went to Democratic candidates and $2.3 million to Republicans. In the September window, Protect Progress gave more than $10 million apiece to Democrats running for Senate in Arizona and Michigan.For the 2024 cycle, political donations from or supporting the crypto industry reached around $190 million, with contributions coming from some of the biggest names in the sector. A report from Public Citizen in August found that crypto companies have accounted for nearly half of all donations made by corporations this election cycle.Crypto groups have spent over $130 million in congressional races for this year's election, including the primaries, according to FEC data.Delmore told CNBC that donations to Fairshake have been tepid the last few months.In September, the group added around $1.1 million, with $800,000 coming from crypto firm Consensys, which was sued by the SEC in June, and $1,000 from Moonsong Labs CEO Derek Yoo.In total, Fairshake has raised more than $160 million and disbursed over $37 million to support House candidates and to run ads opposing Democrat Katie Porter, who lost in the California Senate primary. More than $84 million was transferred to Fairshake's affiliate PACs.",

    "title": "Some Jewish voters in presidential swing states reconsider their longtime devotion to Democrats",
    "content": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- For Rona Kaufman, the signs are everywhere that more Jews feel abandoned by the Democratic Party and may vote for Republican Donald Trump.It's in her Facebook feed. It's in the discomfort she observed during a question-and-answer at a recent Democratic Party campaign event in Pittsburgh. It's in her own family.\"The family that is my generation and older generations, I don't think anybody is voting for Harris, and we've never voted Republican, ever,\" Kaufman, 49, said, referring to Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. \"My sister has a Trump sign outside her house, and that is a huge shift.\"How big a shift? Surveys continue to find that most Jewish voters still support the Democratic ticket, and Kaufman acknowledges that she's an exception.Still, any shift could have enormous implications in Pennsylvania, where tens of thousands of votes decided the past two presidential elections. Many Jewish voters say the 2024 presidential election is like no other in memory, coming amid the growing fallout from Hamas' brutal attack on Israelis last year.Jews represent a sliver of the voting-age population in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, the so-called blue wall of states that Democrats have come to rely on in recent presidential elections. In a close election, they are a big enough constituency that the campaigns of Harris and Trump see the potential for any slippage to swing a close contest.That has forced Harris to walk a line between traditional Democratic constituencies with strong feelings about the war in Gaza, both Jews and Arab Americans -- balancing support for Israel with outrage over the deaths of Israeli and Palestinian civilians and destruction in the region. The Biden administration has been pressuring Israel to end its attacks, which continued last week with the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by Israeli troops.Trump has looked to exploit the opening among Jewish voters especially, saying Harris \" doesn't like \" Jewish people, Jews who don't vote for him \"need their head examined \" and that he'll be the \" best friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the White House.\"In the past, surveys have shown that Jews overwhelmingly vote Democratic. A Pew Research Center poll released last month found that about two-thirds of Jewish voters back Harris. In 2020, about 7 in 10 Jewish voters supported President Joe Biden, according to AP VoteCast.The question is whether that has changed, as Jews now see Israel's survival in a new light as its war with Hamas widens to Hezbollah and Iran.That has put a new focus on the relationship between Israel and the U.S., which continues to provide military aid. And many Jews say rising acts of antisemitism in the United States and anti-Israel protests sweeping across cities and college campuses -- including in Philadelphia -- have made them feel unsafe.In Pennsylvania, still fresh in many minds is a gunman absorbed by white supremacist ideology murdering 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018, the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.As Pennsylvania plays a central role in the election, many say they've never seen such outreach from campaigns as they have now.From Trump on down, Republicans are attempting to win over Jewish voters by highlighting a Democratic Party torn between its traditional and unconditional support for Israel and a growing faction that has accused Israel of war crimes in Gaza, called for Israel to unconditionally stop attacking Hamas, and demanded that the U.S. end its military support for Israel.For some Jews who typically vote Democratic, that has resonated.\"I think that there are folks who are reluctant Trump voters who feel scared as Jews in this country,\" said Jeremy Kazzaz, a Pittsburgh resident and Harris supporter.Kazzaz, however, said Harris has a long record of fighting antisemitism that is relatively unknown to many voters.He pointed out that the Biden administration tapped her husband, Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, to lead a task force to develop a strategy to fight antisemitism well before Hamas attacked Israel. Emhoff has been a key surrogate, campaigning in front of Jewish audiences in the Philadelphia suburbs and speaking at the groundbreaking of a new complex replacing Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue.Still, where Harris' supporters see strong support of Israel -- for instance, the Biden administration sent a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery to Israel, along with the troops needed to operate it -- others see conditional support.That includes Biden urging Israel not to hit Iran's nuclear program or oil fields. At the same time, Biden has stressed his administration's support for Israel and, in her remarks on the anniversary of Hamas' attack, Harris said she'll \"always ensure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself and that I will always work to ensure the safety and security of the Jewish people here and around the world.\"Steve Rosenberg, of Philadelphia, who voted for Trump in 2016 and then Biden in 2020, will vote for Trump in 2024. In large part, Rosenberg sees Biden's lifting of Trump-era sanctions on Iran as providing the cash for the Islamic Republic to finance a war against Israel. Trump imposed the sanctions after voiding a treaty the Obama administration had reached to slow Iran's progress toward nuclear weapons, which he called a bad deal.\"The question is, 'Who is better off today than four years ago?'\" Rosenberg said. \"And the answer is Iran and the mullahs and their proxies, and it's because Biden and Kamala Harris have capitulated to Iran.\"Kaufman, a self-described progressive who lives in Pittsburgh's heavily Jewish Squirrel Hill neighborhood, never thought she would vote for Trump.But now, she expects Trump will continue a hardline stance against Iran -- which she calls an imminent threat to democracy, human rights and western civilization -- and worries that Harris will appease Iran and pander to the party's left wing.Jews with very strong connections to Israel -- her parents were born there and her daughter just finished a two-year eight-month mandatory service with the Israeli army -- are similarly conflicted over supporting Harris, Kaufman said. \"I'm saying it out loud everywhere, but most people aren't saying it out loud.\"Many Jews who support Harris, however, say they see Trump as a threat to democracy.That's important, they say, because minorities -- including Jews -- have reason to fear persecution under dictators.They can unfurl a list of comments by Trump that they see as threatening: using the military against domestic enemies, peddling dual-loyalty tropes about Jews, setting up Jews as scapegoats if he loses and, in the days after Hamas' attack, criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while praising Hezbollah as \"very smart.\"\"That's the conversation that I'm having with Jews,\" said Rabbi Beth Janus of Philadelphia.Janus said Jews she knows are excited that a woman could be president and that she's married to a Jewish man.

    "content": "TAIPEI (Taiwan News) -- A poll conducted by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation (TPOF) showed that support for Taiwan's ruling DPP party has declined 4.4% from the previous month.Polling experts attribute declining public support to the DPP's inability to pass legislation since taking office. Pan-green legislators continue to lack the votes to overcome a KMT and TPP alliance, which led to legislative gridlock.TPOF Chair You Ying-lung (游盈隆) said that while DPP support has declined over the past month, support for the KMT has increased by 2.1% while support for the TPP has rebounded by 0.6%, according to polling data released on Monday (Oct. 21).Poll results showed DPP support at 31.1%, KMT at 25.3%, TPP at 12.6%, New Power Party at 2.3%, and other parties at 1.4%. Meanwhile, 26.6% of respondents said they do not support any particular political party.You said the KMT-TPP alliance commands a 6.8% lead over the DPP. And even if the DPP allies with the New Power Party, it still lags the KMT-TPP alliance by 4.5%. The lack of parliamentary votes makes it difficult for the Cabinet to pass its legislative agenda.Polls show DPP support peaked shortly after winning the 2024 presidential election, reaching 37% in June. At the time, the DPP enjoyed a 20% lead in polls over the KMT.TPOF speculated that DPP support has waned due to several factors, such as the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the death penalty, which potentially offended traditional DPP supporters. Supporters may have also been offended by President Lai Ching-te's (賴清德) public comments referring to the \"Republic of China\" rather than \"Taiwan.\"Since losing the 2024 presidential election, KMT support has fluctuated, reaching a low of 17.8%. Since August, support has stabilized at 23% for two consecutive months, indicating upward momentum and a record high for the year.Following the election, TPP saw its support plummet from 22.5% in January to the current 12.6%. The decline is largely due to the detainment and prosecution of TPP Chair Ko Wen-je (柯文哲) in September.Polling data, however, shows that TPP support still remains strong, as many supporters did not scatter or defect to other parties. The outlook for the TPP will largely be dependent upon the outcome of Ko's legal case.",

    "title": "Trump vs Harris: Why McDonald's is at the centre of US election drama?",
    "content": "Republican presidential nominee and former US President Donald Trump works behind the counter during a visit to McDonalds in Feasterville-Trevose, Pennsylvania, US, October 20, 2024. File Image/ReutersMcDonald's, a staple of American culture, has unexpectedly found itself at the heart of the 2024 US presidential election. Both Democratic and Republican candidates have used the fast-food chain as a symbol in their campaigns.Is Donald Trump 'frying up controversy'?Former US President Donald Trump reignited the fast-food narrative by stopping at a McDonald's in Feasterville-Trevose, Pennsylvania, during a campaign swing on Sunday. Donning an apron, Trump manned the fry station, joking with customers that he had made the food himself.His love for McDonald's has been well-documented, but this visit took on a different tone as it aimed to dispute Harris' claim of having worked at McDonald's as a student.\"I've always wanted to work at McDonald's, but I never did,\" Trump quipped to the restaurant's owner, Derek Giacomantonio. \"I'm running against someone who said she worked here, but it turned out to be a totally phony story.\"He stated that Harris' McDonald's work history was fabricated, even though no evidence has been presented to support his claim.Trump's affection for fast food is well-known. He once served a college football team a feast of McDonald's burgers at the White House, and his regular McDonald's order, according to his son-in-law Jared Kushner, includes \"a Big Mac, Filet-O-Fish, fries, and a vanilla shake.\"This Pennsylvania visit, however, had more to do with undermining Harris than indulging his fast-food cravings.Did Kamala Harris work at McDonald's?Harris' summer job at McDonald's has been a key part of her middle-class origin story. According to Harris' campaign, she worked at a McDonald's in Alameda, California, during the summer of 1983, while studying at Howard University.Her duties included manning the fryer and working the cash register. She often shares this experience as a relatable aspect of her background, highlighting her understanding of working-class struggles.\"I did fries. And then I did the cashier,\" Harris said during an interview on The Drew Barrymore Show earlier this year. She has frequently mentioned this experience, especially during her 2019 campaign when she stood with striking McDonald's workers advocating for better wages.Texas Representative Jasmine Crockett, during the Democratic National Convention, highlighted this contrast in upbringings: \"One candidate worked at McDonald's, while the other was born with a silver spoon in his mouth.\"Harris' supporters have used this story to depict her as someone who understands everyday American struggles, particularly those of fast-food workers trying to make ends meet.Is there a pattern with Trump challenging rivals' biographies?Trump's attack on Harris' McDonald's job follows a pattern of challenging the personal histories of his political opponents, often without providing evidence.From leading the baseless \"birther\" movement that questioned Barack Obama's US citizenship to spreading conspiracy theories about Ted Cruz's father and US President John F Kennedy's assassination, Trump has regularly employed tactics to cast doubt on the credibility of his rivals.In the current election, Trump has falsely implied that Republican opponent Nikki Haley was not a natural-born citizen, despite her South Carolina birth to Indian immigrant parents. His narrative about Harris' McDonald's job follows this same strategy of sowing doubt.\"We would say, well, that's not a big lie. It's a huge lie,\" Trump told reporters, \"because McDonald's was part of her whole thing.\" Yet, Harris has pushed back, saying in a recent interview, \"I worked there as a student,\" while also contrasting her values with Trump's. \"Part of the difference between me and my opponent includes our perspective on the needs of the American people.\"Why else did Trump visit McDonald's?While Trump's McDonald's visit drew attention, it was also part of his broader attempt to appeal to working-class voters. \"These people work hard. They're great,\" Trump said, commenting on the employees he met at the Feasterville McDonald's.He added, \"It requires great expertise, actually, to do it right and to do it fast,\" noting that he was impressed by the work involved.The spectacle of Trump working at McDonald's, however, wasn't without its critics. Joseph Costello, a spokesperson for Harris, said that Trump's visit \"showed exactly what we would see in a second Trump term: exploiting working people for his own personal gain.\"Also Watch:Costello further criticised Trump's understanding of working-class issues, suggesting that Trump's photo-op did little to address the real struggles of fast-food workers.Moreover, Trump avoided addressing questions about whether he would support an increase in the minimum wage, an issue central to many fast-food employees. While he complimented McDonald's workers, he dodged the policy questions about improving their wages.Trump's visit to the McDonald's was a well-publicised event. Police closed streets, and a crowd gathered, with people waving flags and holding signs.The McDonald's owner, Giacomantonio, expressed mixed feelings about hosting the former president, fearing a boycott but eventually agreeing. As Trump supporters lined up outside, John Waters, a local resident, summed up the atmosphere: \"When I drove up, all the cars, unbelievable, I was like, 'He's here's, he's coming.'\"McDonald's, being a cultural icon in the US, has become an unexpected but potent symbol in the 2024 presidential election.",

I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them,\" she wrote in her message to fans. \"I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.\"She signed the end of the statement as \"Childless Cat Lady\" in a likely reference to Trump's running mate JD Vance calling Democratic women \"childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives\" during a 2021 interview that has led to renewed criticism this election cycle.During her three shows in the Florida hot spot city, local Democrats were working with the \"Swifties for Kamala\" outreach group to get more people to vote for Harris, Politico reported over the weekend.\"She holds immense power to get out the vote,\" Florida Democratic Party spokesperson Eden Giagnorio told the outlet of Swift.\"We hope our organizing efforts will help voters connect the dots -- but nothing compares to her advocacy around it.\"",

In a close election, they are a big enough constituency that the campaigns of Harris and Trump see the potential for any slippage to swing a close contest.That has forced Harris to walk a line between traditional Democratic constituencies with strong feelings about the war in Gaza, both Jews and Arab Americans -- balancing support for Israel with outrage over the deaths of Israeli and Palestinian civilians and destruction in the region.

    "title": "Fans are echoing similar sentiments regarding the handwritten message from Taylor Swift to Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports.",
    "content": "Taylor Swift's penmanship was questioned after Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy posted an image of a handwritten note she had sent him Saturday.The 34-year-old singer-songwriter's lucrative Eras Tour hit Miami's Hard Rock Stadium Saturday, with Portnoy, 47, among those in attendance.Via his podcast's Instagram page @bffspod, Portnoy shared an image of Swift's letter, which she sent her brother Austin Swift to deliver to him.The social media post was captioned, 'What a gift from @taylorswift to @stoolpresidente at last night's Eras Tour.'The letter, delivered by Swift's sibling, included a green seal with the number 13 inscribed.The Shake It Off singer penned the correspondence to the media mogul after Portnoy came to her defense after she found herself under social media fire after endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrat candidate in next month's presidential election.Swift told Portnoy in the letter, 'Dave, I'm so happy to have you at the show tonight! I wanted to say thank you for always being so supportive, so loyal, and for having my back when a lot of people didn't.The Grammy-winning singer ended the note, 'I hope you have a blast tonight!! Love, Taylor.'Swift's handwritten note garnered the attention of fans for its content and aesthetics, with one fan saying, 'That signature is wild lol.'Other comments critical of Swift's writing included: 'This is amazing but low key she has terrible hand writing;' 'The signature is not what I'd expect;' and 'I didn't think anyone could have worse handwriting than me till I saw this.'Another said it 'looks like a 6 year old wrote the whole thing,' while a fan defended Swift noting her massive net worth.'That a 6yr olds $1.6billion signature,' the fan said. 'Congrats Dave & thanks for being a Diehard Swiftie & ALWAYS having Moms back!!!'Swift last month took to Instagram to declare her support for the Democrat ticket following Harris' debate with the Republican candidate, former President Donald Trump.'I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election,' Swift said. 'I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.'I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.'The feted entertainer encouraged her fans to get informed on the issues at hand before casting their ballots.'I've done my research, and I've made my choice,' Swift said. 'Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make.'Portnoy, a self-proclaimed Swift superfan who has endorsed Trump, defended the musical artist in a post, saying he didn't change his opinion on her because they have differing political views.'As the king of the Swifties people are asking me what I think of her Kamala endorsement,' Portnoy said. 'I don't care at all. People can vote for whoever they want in this country.'How somebody votes will never change my opinion of a person. I'm voting the other way but to each their own.'",

    "title": "\"Makes zero sense\" - Frances Tiafoe's girlfriend Ayan Broomfield shuts down claims of Kamala Harris being 'unqualified' for US President in rare political statement",
    "content": "Frances Tiafoe's girlfriend Ayan Broomfield has expressed her frustration with the discourse surrounding Kamala Harris' bid to become US President. Broomfield lashed out at claims suggesting that Harris was unqualified for the position.As the US presidential election draws near, members of the tennis community like Martina Navratilova, Andy Roddick, Pam Shriver, and Serena Williams' ex-coach Rennae Stubbs have been openly sharing their views on the race between Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump.Frances Tiafoe's girlfriend Ayan Broomfield has also stepped into the conversation, revealing her major frustration with the election discourse. Broomfield is a tennis player herself, but she is not active on the WTA tour.In a recent clip posted to social media, the 27-year-old made a rare political statement to air her grievances with what has been \"irritating\" her about the 2024 US presidential election. While Broomfield acknowledged that people were entitled to disagree with Kamala Harris' platform, she emphasized that she would not stand for the claims that the Democratic nominee was unqualified for the seat.The Canadian pointed to Harris' extensive accomplishments, arguing that downplaying the 60-year-old's hard-earned achievements made \"zero sense.\"\"I never speak on politics but this specific thing has been bothering me so much about this election. You may not believe in Kamala's strategy or her plan or even her in general. Everyone's entitled to their own opinion but what's been irritating me is when people say that she is not qualified,\" Broomfield said.\"She's an undergrad from Harvard, a law degree from University of California. She was District Attorney, she was Attorney General, she was the Vice President, she's on all these committees. How do you get more qualified than that? Stripping away her hard-earned achievements to justify your lack of support makes zero sense,\" she added.\"I'm thankful for you and always proud of you\" - Frances Tiafoe pens heartfelt message for girlfriend Ayan Broomfield's 27th birthdayFrances Tiafoe and his girlfriend Ayan Broomfield made their relationship public in 2018, and she has since become a familiar face in his players' box, cheering him on at tournaments around the world.Broomfield celebrated her 27th birthday in August, amid the American's campaign at the 2024 Cincinnati Open. Tiafoe penned a touching message for his girlfriend, calling the Canadian \"his rock\" and expressing his gratitude for her unwavering support.\"Happy bday to my right hand....my rock.....my everything. Happy 27th bday my love hope you enjoy the day. See you next week love you always. I'm thankful for you and always proud of you. P.S. Happy I finally got a dub on ur bday,\" Frances Tiafoe captioned his Instagram post.On the tennis front, Tiafoe is set to commence his campaign at the Vienna Open against Cameron Norrie. Meanwhile, Ayan Broomfield recently shared a positive update, celebrating a pain-free practice session for the first time in two years.",

    "content": "Donald Trump, campaigning in Pennsylvania, was seen making fries and serving customers at a McDonald's, mocking Kamala Harris' claims of working there in her youth. A viral video featured a positive interaction with an Indian couple praising Trump. Polls suggest Trump holds significant chances for the 2024 US Presidential Election, especially in Pennsylvania.In an interesting turn of events on Sunday, former US President Donald Trump donned an apron, made fries, and was seen serving them to customers from a drive-through window at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania.The 78-year-old politician and businessman made the move while campaigning in the eastern state. Trump, in his trademark white shirt, red tie, and black suit, put on the McDonald's yellow-black apron and took on the job in a jibe at Democrat leader Kamala Harris.Harris has often said she worked at McDonald's in her youth, in attempts to appeal to the common folk of the country where odd jobs such as these are common. In a clip of the event shared by Elon Musk on X, Trump called Harris' claims a \"phony story\" and turned himself to do the job.\"I have always wanted to work at McDonald's...I could do this all day,\" the Republic front-runner for the 2024 US Presidential Election said on camera.\"This is awesome,\" wrote the billionaire space-tech tycoon on his official X profile, in another sentiment of his endorsement of Trump.However, Trump making fries was not all that took the Internet by storm. In another clip of the incident that went viral, the ex-POTUS had an inspiring encounter with an Indian couple who drove to the McDonald's pick-up window. In awe of Trump, the Indian man praised him and called for another term of Presidency for Trump.The video, posted by HodgeTwins, a verified Trump support account on X, was captioned, \"All Americans love Trump.\"\"Thank you Mr President. You made it possible for ordinary people like us to meet you. Thank you so much. We pray for (you)...You are the type of President we want. Thank you Mr President,\" the man said during the friendly conversation between the two.\"You are not ordinary,\" the business tycoon said to the man, in response while nodding and smiling all the way.According to the betting markets and pollster data, Donald Trump is doing quite well at this point, with major chances of him winning the upcoming US elections, reported The Feed earlier this week. All though there are very slim chances, but latest poll data are claiming that Trump can see a major breakthrough in the swing state of Pennsylvania.",

This cat will be a resident of the Presidential Palace accompanying President Prabowo in his duties.This was known from the social media account owned by Bobby @bobbykertanegara on Sunday, October 20, 2024.In the post, it was seen that Prabowo took a moment to play with Bobby amidst his busy schedule of starting work as the Head of State of Indonesia.Bobby, on top of a stroller with his favorite doll, seemed to enjoy Prabowo's caress. The 8th President of Indonesia even invited Bobby to have a casual conversation since 2016.'Does Bobby want to see Bobby's room?' Prabowo asked his beloved cat.Bobby's presence as a resident of the Presidential Palace was also reinforced by the post of businessman Anindya Bakrie on his Instagram @anindyabakrie.The black and white cat faithfully accompanied Prabowo during his activities at his residence on Jalan Kertanegara IV, Kebayoran Baru, South Jakarta. Bobby was seen accompanying Prabowo in meetings at Kertanegara IV.Bobby's behavior was revealed in Prabowo's tweet on September 26, 2018. In the tweet, Bobby was casually sitting on a long table. Meanwhile, Prabowo and his staff were sitting on chairs around the table in a meeting. His behavior made Bobby be considered as the king of the Kertanegara IV residence.Aside from Bobby, Prabowo also has other pet cats. The winner of the 2024 Presidential Election has three adopted cats named Mika, Miki, and Miko.Through his personal Instagram @Prabowo, on September 7, 2021, Prabowo wrote, 'Introducing our new adopted family members; Mika, Miki, and Miko'.",

    "content": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) - For Rona Kaufman, the signs are everywhere that more Jews feel abandoned by the Democratic Party and may vote for Republican Donald Trump.It's in her Facebook feed. It's in the discomfort she observed during a question-and-answer at a recent Democratic Party campaign event in Pittsburgh. It's in her own family.\"The family that is my generation and older generations, I don´t think anybody is voting for Harris, and we´ve never voted Republican, ever,\" Kaufman, 49, said, referring to Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. \"My sister has a Trump sign outside her house, and that is a huge shift.\"How big a shift? Surveys continue to find that most Jewish voters still support the Democratic ticket, and Kaufman acknowledges that she's an exception.Still, any shift could have enormous implications in Pennsylvania, where tens of thousands of votes decided the past two presidential elections. Many Jewish voters say the 2024 presidential election is like no other in memory, coming amid the growing fallout from Hamas´ brutal attack on Israelis last year.Jews represent a sliver of the voting-age population in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, the so-called blue wall of states that Democrats have come to rely on in recent presidential elections. In a close election, they are a big enough constituency that the campaigns of Harris and Trump see the potential for any slippage to swing a close contest.Rona Kaufman, a self-described progressive who is conflicted over who she will vote for in the presidential election, poses for a portrait in Squirrel Hill, a heavily Jewish neighborhood in Pittsburgh, Saturday, Oct. 20, 2024. (AP Photo/Rebecca Droke)That has forced Harris to walk a line between traditional Democratic constituencies with strong feelings about the war in Gaza, both Jews and Arab Americans - balancing support for Israel with outrage over the deaths of Israeli and Palestinian civilians and destruction in the region. The Biden administration has been pressuring Israel to end its attacks, which continued last week with the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by Israeli troops.Trump has looked to exploit the opening among Jewish voters especially, saying Harris \" doesn't like \" Jewish people, Jews who don't vote for him \"need their head examined \" and that he´ll be the \" best friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the White House.\"In the past, surveys have shown that Jews overwhelmingly vote Democratic. A Pew Research Center poll released last month found that about two-thirds of Jewish voters back Harris. In 2020, about 7 in 10 Jewish voters supported President Joe Biden, according to AP VoteCast.The question is whether that has changed, as Jews now see Israel's survival in a new light as its war with Hamas widens to Hezbollah and Iran.That has put a new focus on the relationship between Israel and the U.S., which continues to provide military aid. And many Jews say rising acts of antisemitism in the United States and anti-Israel protests sweeping across cities and college campuses - including in Philadelphia - have made them feel unsafe.In Pennsylvania, still fresh in many minds is a gunman absorbed by white supremacist ideology murdering 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018, the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.As Pennsylvania plays a central role in the election, many say they've never seen such outreach from campaigns as they have now.From Trump on down, Republicans are attempting to win over Jewish voters by highlighting a Democratic Party torn between its traditional and unconditional support for Israel and a growing faction that has accused Israel of war crimes in Gaza, called for Israel to unconditionally stop attacking Hamas, and demanded that the U.S. end its military support for Israel.For some Jews who typically vote Democratic, that has resonated.\"I think that there are folks who are reluctant Trump voters who feel scared as Jews in this country,\" said Jeremy Kazzaz, a Pittsburgh resident and Harris supporter.Kazzaz, however, said Harris has a long record of fighting antisemitism that is relatively unknown to many voters.He pointed out that the Biden administration tapped her husband, Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, to lead a task force to develop a strategy to fight antisemitism well before Hamas attacked Israel. Emhoff has been a key surrogate, campaigning in front of Jewish audiences in the Philadelphia suburbs and speaking at the groundbreaking of a new complex replacing Pittsburgh´s Tree of Life synagogue.Still, where Harris' supporters see strong support of Israel - for instance, the Biden administration sent a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery to Israel, along with the troops needed to operate it - others see conditional support.That includes Biden urging Israel not to hit Iran´s nuclear program or oil fields. At the same time, Biden has stressed his administration´s support for Israel and, in her remarks on the anniversary of Hamas' attack, Harris said she'll \"always ensure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself and that I will always work to ensure the safety and security of the Jewish people here and around the world.\"Steve Rosenberg, of Philadelphia, who voted for Trump in 2016 and then Biden in 2020, will vote for Trump in 2024. In large part, Rosenberg sees Biden's lifting of Trump-era sanctions on Iran as providing the cash for the Islamic Republic to finance a war against Israel. Trump imposed the sanctions after voiding a treaty the Obama administration had reached to slow Iran's progress toward nuclear weapons, which he called a bad deal.\"The question is, 'Who is better off today than four years ago?´\" Rosenberg said. \"And the answer is Iran and the mullahs and their proxies, and it's because Biden and Kamala Harris have capitulated to Iran.\"Kaufman, a self-described progressive who lives in Pittsburgh's heavily Jewish Squirrel Hill neighborhood, never thought she would vote for Trump.But now, she expects Trump will continue a hardline stance against Iran - which she calls an imminent threat to democracy, human rights and western civilization - and worries that Harris will appease Iran and pander to the party's left wing.Jews with very strong connections to Israel - her parents were born there and her daughter just finished a two-year eight-month mandatory service with the Israeli army - are similarly conflicted over supporting Harris, Kaufman said. \"I´m saying it out loud everywhere, but most people aren't saying it out loud.\"Many Jews who support Harris, however, say they see Trump as a threat to democracy.That's important, they say, because minorities - including Jews - have reason to fear persecution under dictators.They can unfurl a list of comments by Trump that they see as threatening: using the military against domestic enemies, peddling dual-loyalty tropes about Jews, setting up Jews as scapegoats if he loses and, in the days after Hamas' attack, criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while praising Hezbollah as \"very smart.\"Emhoff called Trump a \"known antisemite.\"Some see Trump's efforts on Jan. 6, 2021, to stay in power as a threat.

    "title": "How long will it take Pennsylvania to count the votes for the 2024 election?",
    "content": "As the 2020 presidential election hung in the balance, the national spotlight shined on the Pennsylvania Convention Center, where the Board of Elections was overseeing the counting of a record number of mail-in ballots in Philadelphia.It was a grueling four days -- punctuated by competing demonstrations outside the building -- before enough results had been tallied for the Associated Press to finally project Joe Biden was the state's winner over Donald Trump at 11:25 a.m. on Saturday, Nov. 7.MORE: It's not hype that Pennsylvania could decide the 2024 presidential election. It's math.Four years later, there are reasons to be cautiously optimistic that there won't be another dayslong wait to find out who will earn the critical swing state's coveted 19 electoral votes.There were a number of factors that played rolls in the delayed results in 2020, including the influx of mail-in ballots during the COVID-19 pandemic, scrutiny surrounding the election and the narrow margin of victory, said Omar Sabir, the chairman of the Philadelphia City Commissioners who also was on the board four years ago. The city commissioners are a three-person board in charge of conducting elections in the city, everything from setting policies for voter registrations to overseeing the counting of votes.Pennsylvania is one of only seven states that can't begin processing mail-in ballots until the morning of Election Day.\"That means county election officials cannot even remove the ballots from the envelopes and prepare them to be scanned until that time - on a day when those same officials are also running more than 9,000 polling places across the state,\" the Pennsylvania Department of State said in a statement. \"Then, under the Election Code, counties may not even begin to record and publish mail ballot results until after the polls close at 8 p.m. Election Day.\"Counting mail-in ballots is a more arduous process than tallying in-person votes, involving a combination of trained workers and special machinery to open, sort, review and scan. And the double envelop each ballot comes in, a security measure, doesn't speed up the process, either.\"The Department of State has never had final results on Election Night, regardless of whether media outlets project a winner on that night or a later date,\" the agency said.While the state law restricting early counting of mail-in ballots is still in place, election officials expect much more people to vote in person this time around.Sabir said about 70% of Philadelphian voters typically choose to go to the polls versus mailing in their ballots, but in 2020 it was closer to a 50/50 split. This year, he's expecting around 200,000 mail-in ballots compared to the 374,000 received four years ago.MORE: In Pa.'s U.S. Senate race, Bob Casey seeks fourth term against Republican challenger Dave McCormick\"The fact that there were so many people that were voting by mail, we sort of depended on the mail results,\" Sabir said. \"But in 2024, there's less of a demand for people voting by mail, so we'll likely see the election results be faster this time.\"But then again, if ... it's a close race, we might have to do a recount, we may have to get into the provisionals, and we'll know all that as it gets closer to the election.\"Biden's narrow victory -- having won the state by a 1.17% margin -- meant media organizations were hesitant to make a call with the large number of outstanding mail-in votes. And according to polls, it's going to be another close race, with Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris nearly deadlocked. But 2016 proved that slim margins don't have to mean delayed results: Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by just 0.73%, and the AP called that race at 1:35 a.m. after Election Day.Another change since the last presidential election was the state's passage of Act 88 to establish the Election Integrity Grant program.\"Many counties have used their Act 88 money to purchase equipment to help process and sort mail ballots or to hire additional election workers to handle mail ballots,\" the Department of State said.Sabir said Philly has made technological upgrades with fast-paced scanners and officials visited other election boards across the country where mail-in voting has historically been more popular, like Colorado, to learn about security, public relations, and recruiting and training poll workers.While Pennsylvania election officials are still preparing for delays -- and the conspiracy theories, protests and violence that could accompany them -- there are positive signs there won't be another four-day wait for this election's results.\"By midnight on election night, the overwhelming, vast majority of these votes will be counted,\" Sabir said.",

    "content": "Members of the College Republicans meet and greet Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson after his visit with the club on Monday, Oct. 7 at Upham Hall in Whitewater. Pictured, from left, UWW College Republicans Alumni Association executive director Trenton Kerbs; Chair of UWW College Republicans Sophia Fyfe, Sen. Johnson and UWW College Republicans Alumni Association President John Beauchamp.With the 2024 presidential election right around the corner, UW-Whitewater's College Republicans and College Democrats clubs organized visits from Wisconsin Senators Ron Johnson and Tammy Baldwin.For most Warhawks, this will be the first presidential election in which they are able to cast a vote, making it important for students to tune in.Sen. Baldwin visited Whitewater's campus on Tuesday, Oct. 1 and was accompanied by Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth.According to UWW College Democrats Chairperson Evelyn Schmidt, Duckworth introduced Baldwin and explained how the two had worked together to a room of College Democrats members along with other Whitewater students.\"It really felt like an emotional event -- for me at least - because we had so many people come up to us afterwards and say, 'I can't believe that I met such a historic person and that she was on our campus,'\" Schmidt said.Baldwin's main points, Schmidt added, centered around reproductive freedom and healthcare, specifically, her opinion that everyone should have equitable access to universal healthcare.Baldwin described her role as co-author and advocate for the Affordable Care Act, a bill that allows kids to stay on their parents' health insurance until the age of 26.Overall, Baldwin's visit was a success, Schmidt said. Several students felt seen due to her presence because of her reputation as the first openly LGBTQ+ senator in the country.\"We had a lot of great feedback from campus,\" Schmidt said. \"That really was our goal, to show everybody that politics don't have to be super messy and divisive, and she really spoke to that when she was speaking.\"The following week Sophia Fyfe, chairperson for the UWW College Republicans, hosted a talk with Sen. Johnson Monday, Oct. 7, in Upham Hall.Johnson spoke about the country's debt and how it is important for college-age citizens to be involved in politics and the goings on of the government.\"If I were you - at your age - I'd be pretty ticked off at people in my generation for having racked up more than 35 trillion dollars  debt, that we're not going to have to pay off, but it's going to harm you,\" Johnson said.He added that he would like to think \"more young people would understand what past generations have done to burden  with that debt and start rallying against them.\"In his talk, Johnson made claims that the radical left has taken over important aspects of the United States such as the university system, public school systems and mainstream journalism. He said that college journalism programs are \"graduating more advocates for the left than actual journalists.\"\"College students and young people need to understand what's happening,\" Johnson said. \"They need to have that level of education, and they just don't get it from the legacy media. The legacy media is just not describing reality, they're not telling people the truth. So, I'm trying to come here and let people know - as unuplifting as it is - this is the reality of the situation.\"Fyfe shared that she strongly believes it is important for the university to bring in political speakers. She added that the talks she has attended have been both informative and engaging and thinks there is more benefit to listening to a speaker who knows a lot about a topic as opposed to a discussion amongst peers who may not be as informed.\"Especially with it being an election season, it is just great for students to hear, and I know we had some people in the audience tonight who were of different opinions, and I think that is great because people should be exposed to as many different viewpoints as they can to form their own opinions,\" Fyfe said. \"I think it's great we're having speakers come from both sides. I love it.\"Johnson shared the same sentiment as Fyfe, saying that he feels it is extremely important to talk to and educate young people.\"I hope young people value freedom,\" Johnson said. \"We have now, for decades, listened to the siren song of government benefits and socialism. We've been willingly voting away our freedoms one at a time. Young people need to understand the essential ingredient to America is freedom ... if we lose freedom ... this marvelous experiment of democracy will fail.\"",

    "content": "Taylor Swift's Eras Tour makes its return stateside tonight (Oct. 18) in Miami and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) sees it as an opportunity to encourage youth voter turnout in battleground states like Florida!!!It's launching a Taylor Swift-themed Snapchat filter in battlegrounds states reading, \"I'm in my voting era\" followed by \"Be fearless for...\" Users complete the phrase by tapping through key issues like reproductive rights, climate action, racial justice, and student debt relief and selecting whichever resonates. It also directs users to IWillVote.com, the Democratic Party's flagship voter education website, to learn how to cast their ballot in the upcoming election.\"There are folks from all over the country heading to Miami for the Taylor Swift concert, but also fans from all over the country who will be tuning into it live. We wanted to capitalize on that moment and be creative in the ways that we're reaching some key voters -- like young people, women, and the LGBTQ community -- to talk to them about the issues that are going to matter most in this election,\" Rosemary Boeglin, DNC communications director, told Mashable. \"You'll see that the Snapchat filter not only directs users to IWillVote.com, but it has them engage on the issues.\"Additionally, the DNC is placing ads on a boat near Swift's concert venue and on billboards across Miami that read, \"I'm in my Kamala Era\" and \"A new way forward...Ready for it?\" The ads also direct viewers to IWillVote.com.This is the first Snapchat filter the DNC has launched this election cycle. It's part of its strategy aimed at meeting young voters where they are in a fractured media environment.According to Snapchat, it has more than 100 million users in the United States, around 80 percent of whom are at least 18 years old and eligible to vote. It has a higher percentage of users under 30 than other major social media platforms, according to the New York Times. The paper reported the Harris-Walz campaign has spent $5.3 million on Snapchat campaign ads so far, while the Trump campaign has yet to buy a single Snapchat ad.This Snapchat campaign comes after the pop star endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in an Instagram post after the Presidential debate. To her 284 million followers she wrote, \"I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.\" The custom voter registration link she posted on her Instagram story that same night saw 405,999 visitors.Also timed to Swift's Miami concert is Swifties for Kamala's You're Not Alone Kid friendship bracelet campaign. The grassroots organization of Swift fans is distributing Harris-themed friendship bracelets across the U.S. with a QR code directing the recipients to voting information.",

    "title": "Some Jewish voters in presidential swing states reconsider their longtime devotion to Democrats",
    "content": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- For Rona Kaufman, the signs are everywhere that more Jews feel abandoned by the Democratic Party and may vote for Republican Donald Trump.It's in her Facebook feed. It's in the discomfort she observed during a question-and-answer at a recent Democratic Party campaign event in Pittsburgh. It's in her own family.\"The family that is my generation and older generations, I don't think anybody is voting for Harris, and we've never voted Republican, ever,\" Kaufman, 49, said, referring to Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. \"My sister has a Trump sign outside her house, and that is a huge shift.\"ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOWHow big a shift? Surveys continue to find that most Jewish voters still support the Democratic ticket, and Kaufman acknowledges that she's an exception.Still, any shift could have enormous implications in Pennsylvania, where tens of thousands of votes decided the past two presidential elections. Many Jewish voters say the 2024 presidential election is like no other in memory, coming amid the growing fallout from Hamas' brutal attack on Israelis last year.Jews represent a sliver of the voting-age population in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, the so-called blue wall of states that Democrats have come to rely on in recent presidential elections. In a close election, they are a big enough constituency that the campaigns of Harris and Trump see the potential for any slippage to swing a close contest.That has forced Harris to walk a line between traditional Democratic constituencies with strong feelings about the war in Gaza, both Jews and Arab Americans -- balancing support for Israel with outrage over the deaths of Israeli and Palestinian civilians and destruction in the region. The Biden administration has been pressuring Israel to end its attacks, which continued last week with the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by Israeli troops.Trump has looked to exploit the opening among Jewish voters especially, saying Harris \" doesn't like \" Jewish people, Jews who don't vote for him \"need their head examined \" and that he'll be the \" best friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the White House.\"ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOWIn the past, surveys have shown that Jews overwhelmingly vote Democratic. A Pew Research Center poll released last month found that about two-thirds of Jewish voters back Harris. In 2020, about 7 in 10 Jewish voters supported President Joe Biden, according to AP VoteCast.The question is whether that has changed, as Jews now see Israel's survival in a new light as its war with Hamas widens to Hezbollah and Iran.That has put a new focus on the relationship between Israel and the U.S., which continues to provide military aid. And many Jews say rising acts of antisemitism in the United States and anti-Israel protests sweeping across cities and college campuses -- including in Philadelphia -- have made them feel unsafe.In Pennsylvania, still fresh in many minds is a gunman absorbed by white supremacist ideology murdering 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018, the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.As Pennsylvania plays a central role in the election, many say they've never seen such outreach from campaigns as they have now.ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOWFrom Trump on down, Republicans are attempting to win over Jewish voters by highlighting a Democratic Party torn between its traditional and unconditional support for Israel and a growing faction that has accused Israel of war crimes in Gaza, called for Israel to unconditionally stop attacking Hamas, and demanded that the U.S. end its military support for Israel.For some Jews who typically vote Democratic, that has resonated.\"I think that there are folks who are reluctant Trump voters who feel scared as Jews in this country,\" said Jeremy Kazzaz, a Pittsburgh resident and Harris supporter.Kazzaz, however, said Harris has a long record of fighting antisemitism that is relatively unknown to many voters.He pointed out that the Biden administration tapped her husband, Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, to lead a task force to develop a strategy to fight antisemitism well before Hamas attacked Israel. Emhoff has been a key surrogate, campaigning in front of Jewish audiences in the Philadelphia suburbs and speaking at the groundbreaking of a new complex replacing Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue.Still, where Harris' supporters see strong support of Israel -- for instance, the Biden administration sent a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery to Israel, along with the troops needed to operate it -- others see conditional support.ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOWThat includes Biden urging Israel not to hit Iran's nuclear program or oil fields. At the same time, Biden has stressed his administration's support for Israel and, in her remarks on the anniversary of Hamas' attack, Harris said she'll \"always ensure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself and that I will always work to ensure the safety and security of the Jewish people here and around the world.\"Steve Rosenberg, of Philadelphia, who voted for Trump in 2016 and then Biden in 2020, will vote for Trump in 2024. In large part, Rosenberg sees Biden's lifting of Trump-era sanctions on Iran as providing the cash for the Islamic Republic to finance a war against Israel. Trump imposed the sanctions after voiding a treaty the Obama administration had reached to slow Iran's progress toward nuclear weapons, which he called a bad deal.\"The question is, 'Who is better off today than four years ago?'\" Rosenberg said. \"And the answer is Iran and the mullahs and their proxies, and it's because Biden and Kamala Harris have capitulated to Iran.\"Kaufman, a self-described progressive who lives in Pittsburgh's heavily Jewish Squirrel Hill neighborhood, never thought she would vote for Trump.But now, she expects Trump will continue a hardline stance against Iran -- which she calls an imminent threat to democracy, human rights and western civilization -- and worries that Harris will appease Iran and pander to the party's left wing.Jews with very strong connections to Israel -- her parents were born there and her daughter just finished a two-year eight-month mandatory service with the Israeli army -- are similarly conflicted over supporting Harris, Kaufman said. \"I'm saying it out loud everywhere, but most people aren't saying it out loud.\"Many Jews who support Harris, however, say they see Trump as a threat to democracy.That's important, they say, because minorities -- including Jews -- have reason to fear persecution under dictators.They can unfurl a list of comments by Trump that they see as threatening: using the military against domestic enemies, peddling dual-loyalty tropes about Jews, setting up Jews as scapegoats if he loses and, in the days after Hamas' attack, criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while praising Hezbollah as \"very smart.\"Emhoff called Trump a \"known antisemite.\"Some see Trump's efforts on Jan. 6, 2021, to stay in power as a threat. Many are wary of his affinity for dictators, and bring up his dinner at his Mar-a-Lago resort with far-right activist Nick Fuentes and rapper Ye, two men known for spewing antisemitic rhetoric.ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\"That's the conversation that I'm having with Jews,\" said Rabbi Beth Janus of Philadelphia.Janus said Jews she knows are excited that a woman could be president and that she's married to a Jewish man. Conversely, Trump's support for Israel is transactional, she said.\"When it serves his needs, his objectives, he supports Israel,\" Janus said. \"But if it didn't, then he wouldn't support Israel.\"___Follow Marc Levy at twitter.com/timelywriter.",

Various networks show horror films.For those who still enjoy a cable subscription, here is a selection of cable and network TV shows, movies and specials that broadcast this week, Oct. 21-27 Details and times are subject to change.MondayPOPPA'S HOUSE 8:30 p.m. on CBS. The father-son duo Damon Wayans and Damon Wayans Jr. (who have previously played father and son on the show \"Happy Endings\") are back together for a new comedy about a divorced radio host, Poppa (Wayans). He has his views challenged when he starts working with a new female co-host, and is also trying to communicate effectively with his adult son (Wayans Jr.).WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS 10 p.m. on FX. The streets are lined with spooky décor, Spirit Halloween is popping up at every corner and there is a crisp in the air. That can only mean one thing -- it's time to welcome back everyone's favorite Staten Island-dwelling vampires for the sixth and final season of this faux-documentary show.TuesdayPOLTERGEIST (1982) 8 p.m. on AMC. First vampires, now paranormal activity. Everything is peachy keen with this California family until ghosts start communicating with them through the television screen. When their daughter Carol Ann (Heather O'Rourke) goes missing, her family seeks out a parapsychologist and exorcist to help find her.THE EXORCIST (1973) 10:30 p.m. on AMC. Speaking of exorcism -- this movie teaches us that if you find your child possessed by the devil, it's going to be a real hassle to undo. \"It establishes a new low for grotesque special effects, all of which, I assume, have some sort of religious approval since two Jesuit priests, who are listed as among the film's technical advisers, also appear in the film as actors,\" Vincent Canby wrote in his review for The New York Times.WednesdayBREATH OF FIRE 9 p.m. on HBO. Yogi Bhajan, also known as Siri Singh Sahib, brought a version of Kundalini yoga, a type of energy work and exercise based in Hinduism, to the United States. His mentee Katie Griggs, professionally known as Guru Jagat, popularized the practice in her Los Angeles studio, which attracted a Hollywood clientele. This documentary series dives into accusations of exploitation not only at Griggs's yoga studio but also stemming from Yogi Bhajan's influence and the practices he promoted.ThursdayHELL'S KITCHEN 8 p.m. on Fox. Now in its 23rd season, this chef competition show is celebrating a milestone -- 350 episodes. In reflecting on the show, I recall a few lessons straight from the mouth of the host, judge and executive producer Gordon Ramsay: don't burn the meat, don't lie and don't over cook the seafood. But among the many meme-able moments, I won't ever forget Ramsay commenting that one contestant's lamb was so raw, it basically still had wool on it.FridayTHE SIXTH SENSE (1999) 7:10 p.m. on HBO. This movie might have one of the most memorable plot twists -- don't worry I won't spoil it here. The story follows Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who is visited by ghosts. The only person he reveals this to is his psychologist, Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis). \"Every so often, the movie gives us creepy little glimpses of the corpse-strewn world as it appears through Cole's tormented vision,\" Stephen Holden wrote in his review for The Times. \"At first, the doctor doesn't believe the boy. But then, well, let's not take the story any further lest its colossally sentimental payoff be compromised.\"ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN (1976) 8 p.m. on TCM. The 2024 presidential election is only 15 days away, so why not reminisce on a stressful and confounding moment in our political history? This movie stars Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford as the Washington Post reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward in a fictionalized version of their reporting on the Watergate scandal, which led to President Richard Nixon's resignation in 1974. The point of the movie is to \"make understandable to non‐professionals the appeal and the rewards of American journalism at its best,\" Vincent Canby wrote in his review for The Times.SaturdaySETH MEYERS: DAD MAN WALKING 10 p.m. on HBO. Seth Meyers, the host of \"Late Night,\" is probably best known for his political segments, interviews and day drinking with celebrities. But this standup special dives into Meyers's personal life with stories about raising three children, living in New York City and reflections on his family dynamics.SundaySOMEBODY SOMEWHERE 10:30 p.m. on HBO. This drama series, back for its third and final season, has followed Sam Miller (Bridget Everett) as she's moved back to her hometown in Kansas but doesn't necessarily fit the mold. This new story focuses on Sam's grief over the sister's death and her increased level of comfort back in her home state.",

    "title": "Election lawyer Justin Levitt on why 2024 litigation is mostly hot air",
    "content": "Rosenfeld is the editor and chief correspondent of Voting Booth, a project of the Independent Media Institute.Justin Levitt has been on the frontlines in some of American democracy's biggest legal battles for two decades. Now a law professor at Los Angeles' Loyola Marymount University, he has worked as a voting rights attorney and top Justice Department civil rights attorney, and he has advised both major parties.In this Q&A, he describes why 2024's partisan election litigation is likely to have limited impacts on voters and counting ballots. But that won't stop partisan propagandists and fundraising from preying on voters.The interview has been edited for length and clarity.Steven Rosenfeld: The 2024 presidential election has more partisan litigation targeting how elections are run than I've ever seen. Does this worry you?Justin Levitt: It sure seems like a lot. ... That said, I don't generally gauge the amount of litigation by the raw quantity of filings -- not least because I got internet-famous for 30 seconds in 2020 by reminding people that a lawsuit without provable facts of a legal violation is just a tweet with a filing fee. And, so, for the privilege of 400 bucks or so, you too can file a lawsuit, and have it count toward the total volume. But that doesn't mean there's anything of substance in there. I tend to evaluate the degree of litigation, not just by adding up numbers, but by sort of how serious some cases are. By that count, I think there are probably more cases now, but not more serious cases. And I think that's meaningful.SR: How can we help readers understand what is and is not serious? I always thought that a serious case when it came to election challenges and recounts was you had to prove that there were enough votes in dispute that would change the outcome.JL: That's one good measure. And meaningfully dispute -- not just  with made-up facts that can't be proven. So, in 2020, I think there were zero lawsuits, at least concerning the presidential election after the election, that had to do with meaningfully disputed ballots. Contrast that with before the election trying to get clear on the rules that were going to be in place. There was a hefty amount of litigation over what we do in a pandemic; some pushing for relaxation of the normal rules, some pushing against administrative action that relaxed the normal rules, and an awful lot of uncertainty at stake. There was a lot more litigation with a meaningful capacity to impact the way Americans cast and count ballots in 2020 than there is now. And that was all pre-election, not post-election.SR: Many of 2024's pre-election suits have not yet been decided or heard by judges. Many officials have not even replied to recently filed suits. What are people to make of that?JL: I think what people are to make of those is not very much. In most cases, those lawsuits are not going to affect the final result. And they're not going to affect the process of filing a ballot, either. For example, the most significant of mail ballot cases, right at the moment, have to do with the deadline for returning ballots and, in particular, challenges to state deadlines. The easiest thing that readers can do to make sure that their mail ballots get in on time, regardless of the litigation, is fill them out and get them in. There is no serious challenge, at least as far as I'm aware, to any mail ballot that arrives by Election Day.SR: Yet when I look at the litigation, I see partisans, especially Republicans, targeting little-known steps and claiming the process is flawed. They exaggerate the impact of mistakes. They say results can't be trusted unless voters are disqualified and ballots thrown out.JL: That's happening. And definitely going to happen. I'll get back to the mistakes in just a second, because I think you're right about that, and yet, I don't think it ends up mattering.But the point about creating the context for noise and disruption is 100 percent going to happen. And how do I know that? I know that because for eight years now, the median candidate of a major political party has claimed, without evidence, that there is a vast amount of fraud in the process, including for elections that he won. And so, is that coming again? You bet. Is it true? No. It hasn't been true for eight years, and it's still not true now.But that messaging, that noise and the disruption that follows from it is absolutely coming. And also, it doesn't change the result. Some of the litigation is premised on a view of the law as magical legalism. If you say the right words in Latin in the right order, it's like casting a spell, and, all of a sudden, you can magically sweep away millions of votes. I understand the view, the under-informed view, because some of these processes seem byzantine. But the law at its heart is a dispute resolution system. It is not a venue for magic in the way we actually make electoral choices. And the things that lawsuits are pointing to as mistakes are not even mistakes. Sometimes they're just perceptions of mistakes, or perceptions of things that are allegedly contrary to law -- but aren't in any way.But sometimes  do actually capture real mistakes. It turns out that we have a process for resolving those mistakes and it's not \"Throw away all of the ballots.\" The measure of a voting system is not, \"Have we made a mistake,\" just like the measure of any human endeavor is not, \"Has there been a mistake?\" The measure of a voting system is, what are the belt and suspenders procedural processes? Is it robust enough to actually resolve mistakes? What do we do if a mistake happens? And it turns out that every election structure in literally every county across America has a bunch of safeguards for figuring out what we do in case of mistakes, and most of the litigation now just ignores all of that.SR: That's true, of course. But isn't much of the litigation's purpose to sow propaganda and distrust?JL: It's more than just propagandizing; it's for fundraising. An awful lot of this is messaging-based. But that is not just for the message itself. That's because the message usually comes attached to, \"We're fighting for you and give us money.\" There's an enormous amount of litigation at the moment that is being filed either for pure messaging or for fundraising. It's a big business now. That's not what litigation should be for.We saw this, for example, in the period between November of 2020 and January of 2021 -- I'm going to use this as an example, although it was surely not the only example -- President Trump's personal leadership PAC, which is a fundraising vehicle that effectively is completely unconstrained by campaign finance rules. It can be used for any purpose at all, including, \"I feel like going out to dinner at a nicer place,\" or \"I feel like buying a jet,\" or \"I feel like buying a house.\" It's walk-around money. It's money that goes straight into his wallet, effectively. I believe that one fundraising vehicle raised $30 million between November and January based on appeals that were almost exclusively focused on \"Keep us in the litigation fight,\" even when there was zero accountability for ensuring that any of that money would actually be used for litigation.I cite that example because it's big business to be filing cases to show that you're in the fight, or to demonstrate that you're in the fight, even if there's not really that much to be fighting about, or even if the courts are extremely unlikely to give you relief. So how should readers sort of figure out which is which? I have a real easy benchmark.SR: Which is ...JL: If the election is within 537 votes in a major swing state -- and that number is not obviously taken out of thin air, that's the margin in Bush vs. Gore  -- then absolutely every one of these lawsuits is important. Why? Because absolutely every one of them matters, because everything matters. A butterfly ballot flapping its wings somewhere could change the results. That close a margin means that the margin of victory is inevitably less than the margin of error. A tiny change in one place changes the election. But I say that in order to make the more important point: With a margin of more than 537 votes, none of these cases matter. Absolutely none of them.Even if an election is really close, and 2020 was really close in a number of states, if it's not 500 votes close, then the thing that decides the election is the choices of the people who turn out, and not the lawyers and not the courts. And I say that as a law professor and an election lawyer who's deeply invested in the importance of some of these concepts. But honestly, the people are going to end up deciding this election -- not lawyers.SR: This is very clarifying and grounding, especially as people's anxieties are rising.JL: I don't begrudge them the anxiety. There's a whole industry out there that's designed to stoke their anxiety and then, usually, to channel that anxiety toward a request for a little bit of money. So, I am in no way belittling people for feeling freaked out, because there are a lot of people who are paid very handsomely to try to make sure that they're freaked out.I'm only saying I'm giving them permission not to feel freaked out about the process, about the structure. I've been in this business for more than two decades now. And I worked in a variety of roles, including in campaigns, in government. I also have served as a precinct election official. The system was put to the test about as thoroughly as any system ever has been in 2020 where there was a conscious attempt to break the process and a lot of not-conscious factors that could well have broken the process, including a once-a-century pandemic. And the process held remarkably thoroughly. That's credit to a giant roster of people and officials and election workers. And it didn't just happen.But in a system with thousands of alleged points of failure, none of them failed. And in order to swing an election, you need all of them to fail. And absolutely none of them did, despite enormous pressure to the contrary. So, I am quite confident that this year, the processes and systems are robust enough and resilient enough.",

(AP) -- For Rona Kaufman, the signs are everywhere that more Jews feel abandoned by the Democratic Party and may vote for Republican Donald Trump.It's in her Facebook feed. It's in the discomfort she observed during a question-and-answer at a recent Democratic Party campaign event in Pittsburgh. It's in her own family.\"The family that is my generation and older generations, I don't think anybody is voting for Harris, and we've never voted Republican, ever,\" Kaufman, 49, said, referring to Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. \"My sister has a Trump sign outside her house, and that is a huge shift.\"ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOWHow big a shift? Surveys continue to find that most Jewish voters still support the Democratic ticket, and Kaufman acknowledges that she's an exception.Still, any shift could have enormous implications in Pennsylvania, where tens of thousands of votes decided the past two presidential elections. Many Jewish voters say the 2024 presidential election is like no other in memory, coming amid the growing fallout from Hamas' brutal attack on Israelis last year.Jews represent a sliver of the voting-age population in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, the so-called blue wall of states that Democrats have come to rely on in recent presidential elections. In a close election, they are a big enough constituency that the campaigns of Harris and Trump see the potential for any slippage to swing a close contest.That has forced Harris to walk a line between traditional Democratic constituencies with strong feelings about the war in Gaza, both Jews and Arab Americans -- balancing support for Israel with outrage over the deaths of Israeli and Palestinian civilians and destruction in the region. The Biden administration has been pressuring Israel to end its attacks, which continued last week with the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by Israeli troops.Trump has looked to exploit the opening among Jewish voters especially, saying Harris \" doesn't like \" Jewish people, Jews who don't vote for him \"need their head examined \" and that he'll be the \" best friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the White House.\"ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOWIn the past, surveys have shown that Jews overwhelmingly vote Democratic. A Pew Research Center poll released last month found that about two-thirds of Jewish voters back Harris. In 2020, about 7 in 10 Jewish voters supported President Joe Biden, according to AP VoteCast.The question is whether that has changed, as Jews now see Israel's survival in a new light as its war with Hamas widens to Hezbollah and Iran.That has put a new focus on the relationship between Israel and the U.S., which continues to provide military aid. And many Jews say rising acts of antisemitism in the United States and anti-Israel protests sweeping across cities and college campuses -- including in Philadelphia -- have made them feel unsafe.In Pennsylvania, still fresh in many minds is a gunman absorbed by white supremacist ideology murdering 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018, the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.As Pennsylvania plays a central role in the election, many say they've never seen such outreach from campaigns as they have now.ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOWFrom Trump on down, Republicans are attempting to win over Jewish voters by highlighting a Democratic Party torn between its traditional and unconditional support for Israel and a growing faction that has accused Israel of war crimes in Gaza, called for Israel to unconditionally stop attacking Hamas, and demanded that the U.S. end its military support for Israel.For some Jews who typically vote Democratic, that has resonated.\"I think that there are folks who are reluctant Trump voters who feel scared as Jews in this country,\" said Jeremy Kazzaz, a Pittsburgh resident and Harris supporter.Kazzaz, however, said Harris has a long record of fighting antisemitism that is relatively unknown to many voters.He pointed out that the Biden administration tapped her husband, Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, to lead a task force to develop a strategy to fight antisemitism well before Hamas attacked Israel. Emhoff has been a key surrogate, campaigning in front of Jewish audiences in the Philadelphia suburbs and speaking at the groundbreaking of a new complex replacing Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue.Still, where Harris' supporters see strong support of Israel -- for instance, the Biden administration sent a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery to Israel, along with the troops needed to operate it -- others see conditional support.ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOWThat includes Biden urging Israel not to hit Iran's nuclear program or oil fields. At the same time, Biden has stressed his administration's support for Israel and, in her remarks on the anniversary of Hamas' attack, Harris said she'll \"always ensure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself and that I will always work to ensure the safety and security of the Jewish people here and around the world.\"Steve Rosenberg, of Philadelphia, who voted for Trump in 2016 and then Biden in 2020, will vote for Trump in 2024. In large part, Rosenberg sees Biden's lifting of Trump-era sanctions on Iran as providing the cash for the Islamic Republic to finance a war against Israel. Trump imposed the sanctions after voiding a treaty the Obama administration had reached to slow Iran's progress toward nuclear weapons, which he called a bad deal.\"The question is, 'Who is better off today than four years ago?'\" Rosenberg said. \"And the answer is Iran and the mullahs and their proxies, and it's because Biden and Kamala Harris have capitulated to Iran.\"Kaufman, a self-described progressive who lives in Pittsburgh's heavily Jewish Squirrel Hill neighborhood, never thought she would vote for Trump.But now, she expects Trump will continue a hardline stance against Iran -- which she calls an imminent threat to democracy, human rights and western civilization -- and worries that Harris will appease Iran and pander to the party's left wing.Jews with very strong connections to Israel -- her parents were born there and her daughter just finished a two-year eight-month mandatory service with the Israeli army -- are similarly conflicted over supporting Harris, Kaufman said. \"I'm saying it out loud everywhere, but most people aren't saying it out loud.\"Many Jews who support Harris, however, say they see Trump as a threat to democracy.That's important, they say, because minorities -- including Jews -- have reason to fear persecution under dictators.They can unfurl a list of comments by Trump that they see as threatening: using the military against domestic enemies, peddling dual-loyalty tropes about Jews, setting up Jews as scapegoats if he loses and, in the days after Hamas' attack, criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while praising Hezbollah as \"very smart.\"Emhoff called Trump a \"known antisemite.\"Some see Trump's efforts on Jan. 6, 2021, to stay in power as a threat.

    "title": "PICTORIAL: Trump Tackles Kamala Over Work History, Visits McDonald's In Pennsylvania As Campaign Heats Up",
    "content": "With less than two weeks left before the United States presidential election, the candidates were ramping up their efforts to win over voters in key battleground states. Pennsylvania, with its 19 crucial electoral votes, has emerged as a pivotal state, and Republican candidate Donald Trump is wasting no time making his presence felt there.On Sunday, Trump made a campaign stop at a McDonald's in Feasterville, Bucks County, following a rally in Latrobe on Saturday. Donning an apron, the former president worked the drive-thru, handing out orders to customers and taking the opportunity to connect with locals.\"It's a great franchise. It's a great company,\" Trump said of McDonald's, adding that he has always had a deep affection for Pennsylvania. He joked about his brief shift behind the counter, quipping, \"Now I have worked at McDonald's. I've now worked for 15 minutes longer than Kamala.\"LEADERSHIP recalls that the US Vice President and Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris, had previously stated that she worked at McDonald's during her college days, but Trump cast doubt on that claim, offering no evidence to support his skepticism. \"She lies about her job applications and she's told some horrible lies,\" he remarked, before pivoting to his own ability to unify the nation. \"Unifying? I think she's the most divisive person I've ever seen,\" he said in response to a question from CBS Philadelphia. \"I think I'm the one that brings everyone together.\"The visit to McDonald's drew massive crowds, with supporters gathering hours ahead of Trump's arrival at 1:30pm local time. His appearance was part of a broader strategy to win over Pennsylvania voters, as recent polls showed a neck-and-neck race between Trump and Kamala Harris, each capturing 50% of the vote in the state.When asked whether he would accept the results of the 2024 presidential election, Trump replied through the drive-thru window, \"Yeah sure, if it's a fair election, always.\"",

    "content": "The non-yielding Silver gains ground due to easing monetary policies from major central banks.Silver price (XAG/USD) extends its winning streak for the fifth consecutive day, trading around $34.10 during the Asian session on Monday. This upward trend is driven by safe-haven demand amidst escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.Lebanese media report that Israel has launched a new series of airstrikes on southern Beirut, targeting the offices of Hezbollah's al-Qard al-Hassan financial institution. Furthermore, the US government has initiated an investigation into the unauthorized release of classified documents that outline Israel's military preparations for a potential strike on Iran.Furthermore, easing monetary policies from major central banks are bolstering non-yielding Silver prices. On Monday, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) reduced the 1-year Loan Prime Rate (LPR) from 3.35% to 3.10% and the 5-year LPR from 3.85% to 3.60%. Last week, the European Central Bank (ECB) also opted to cut its interest rates by 25 basis points.The Bank of Canada (BoC) is widely anticipated to implement a significant interest rate cut of 50 basis points at its upcoming monetary policy meeting on Wednesday. Recent inflation data suggests that both the Bank of England (BoE) and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) may consider potential rate cuts next month. Additionally, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) is expected to lower interest rates by 50 basis points by the end of 2024.Regarding the US elections, markets appear optimistic about Republican nominee Donald Trump winning the 2024 presidential election. Trump's fiscal and trade policies are viewed as inflationary and favorable for the US Dollar (USD), which could negatively impact Silver demand. A stronger US Dollar makes Silver more expensive for buyers using foreign currencies, potentially dampening their purchasing power.",

    "title": "Fran Lebowitz holds 'State of the Union' conversation at the Bromery Center",
    "content": "Fran Lebowitz has a lot on her mind, and she isn't afraid to tell you about it. On Thursday, Oct. 10, the author, orator and humorist took to the Tillis Hall stage for a \"State of the Union\" conversation hosted by the University of Massachusetts Amherst's Fine Arts Center. During the discussion, the 73-year-old gave her famously unfiltered thoughts on a wide range of topics, from the 2024 presidential election to her love of grammar and punctuation.The night began with a land acknowledgment read by the FAC's director, Jamilla Deria, who then welcomed the moderator, Michael Blake, to the stage. Blake, who boasts an impressive political career, as the White House associate director of public engagement under Barack Obama. He also the vice chair at large for the Democratic National Committee and a New York State Assembly member. In addition, he is the president of Next Level Sports and Entertainment, the only Black-owned national TV sports network.Following Blake's introduction, Lebowitz took to the stage, clad in a navy blue suit, cuffed blue jeans and her signature black glasses. From the get-go, she had the audience laughing, joking about a hypothetical bid for the presidency. \"I could run for president, but I wouldn't win,\" Lebowitz said. \"I couldn't even win this room and they all paid to see me.\"While Lebowitz might not be running for president, she certainly has a lot to say when it comes to this year's presidential candidates. Lebowitz, with her infamous deadpan sense of humor, joked that she believes former President Donald Trump is illiterate. \"When he was asked about Project 2025, Donald Trump said he hasn't read it,\" Lebowitz said. \"Of course he hasn't, he can't read.\"Although a self-described \"angry\" and \"bitter\" person, she is not entirely pessimistic about this upcoming election. \"I think Kamala Harris has a good chance of winning, so I feel some hope,\" she said.This Election Day, Lebowitz will be in London speaking at an event, but will cast her vote for Harris early. She was also in London on the day Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, so she joked that her visits to England are bad omens for the country.\"You know, if things go back , you won't have to come back,\" Blake quipped.Trump isn't the only Republican politician that Lebowitz has a bone to pick with. Less than 24 hours prior to the conversation, Hurricane Milton made landfall in Siesta Key, Florida, just two weeks after the state was ravaged by Hurricane Helene. As such, Florida's governor, Ron DeSantis, has been frequently featured on national television news programs as the state recovers. Always the iconoclast, these appearances have not been beneficial for DeSantis, according to Lebowitz.\" has no idea what a government is even though he's a governor,\" said Lebowitz. \"He says Florida is where 'woke' goes to die. Yeah, Florida is where everyone goes to die.\"Blake then moved the conversation away from politics, bringing up Lebowitz's close friendship with late American novelist Toni Morrison. The two met in 1978 at an event held by the Academy of American Poets. According to Lebowitz, their friendship was instantaneous. \"I've known a lot of smart people in my life,\" Lebowitz said. \"But wise? There's only been one wise person, and it's .\"At the night's halfway point, Blake wished the audience goodnight as Lebowitz took to the podium herself and opened the room for questions. She calls this portion of her events the \"Fran Talk.\"The audience's questions ranged greatly in topic, from her strong dislike of travel to her thoughts on Boston being called \"The City\" (For the record, New York will always be \"The City\" in Lebowitz's eyes. Boston is just \"a city.\").There was one question from the audience that Lebowitz would not answer: \"How do you feel about the U.S. government's handling of the situation in Gaza?\" Lebowitz immediately dismissed the question, saying that conflict in the Middle East \"didn't start yesterday.\"The night's final question involved the U.S. Supreme Court; specifically, the court's recent ruling that the President has absolute immunity. \"I don't know Joe Biden,\" said Lebowitz. \"But if I did, I'd tell him, ', you're the President, but you're now the King. Dissolve the Supreme Court.\"After leaving the stage, Lebowitz held a free book signing in the front lobby. There, hundreds of attendees lined up for Lebowitz's autograph and a chance to ask questions of their own.",

In fact, he strongly urges the American people to \"make the right choice\" and vote red this election.One thing that's especially triggered him is hecklers allegedly getting kicked out of a Kamala Harris rally for yelling their praise to the Lord and Harris' remark afterward.Venting his frustrations on the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), Chandler touched on what happened at the rally and shared his thoughts.\"If you're a Christian, this has to be the nail in the coffin of even thinking about voting for her,\" Michael Chandler began in his post on X. \"...While peddling the idea of killing babies, she directly rejects his (Jesus') name. And they were kicked out for saying #jesusislord #christisking - get out and vote early.\"In the video, heckling can be heard in the background but isn't clearly picked up by the audio. However, Kamala Harris can be heard clearly and says, \"Oh, you guys are at the wrong rally... No, I think you meant to go to the smaller one down the street.\"A fan commented on Chandler's post, saying: \"Religion and politics don't mix brotha. Neither one of the candidates is Christian, so don't fool yourself.\"This elicited a response from Chandler, who replied: \"But only one (presidential candidate) would completely denounce the statement...a rare authentic moment for her. A seemingly involuntary response that showed her true heart.\"",

    "title": "An Assessment of U.S. Political Divisiveness and its Implications for Domestic and International Security",
    "content": "Dr Estelle Denton-Townshend is a teaching fellow at the University of Waikato. She holds a Masters and PhD in international politics and security, focusing on the Middle East. Divergent Options' content does not contain information of an official nature, nor does the content represent the official position of any government, any organization, or any group.Title: An Assessment of U.S. Political Divisiveness and its Implications for Domestic and International SecurityAuthor and / or Article Point of View: Estelle Denton-Townshend has a PhD from the University of Waikato in New Zealand. She currently works at the University of Waikato where she is a teaching fellow. The author believes that escalating U.S. political divisiveness drives internal stability which could have international security repercussions. This internal instability is magnified by force multipliers like economic inequality and climate change.Summary: Political divisiveness is a significant internal security threat in the U.S. This threat leaves the U.S. vulnerable to information warfare efforts mounted by China, Iran, Russia, or even Israel. Until the U.S. ensures it can withstand this threat, it will be unable to compete globally, and this will negatively impact the rules-based international order.Text: With three armed incidents near U.S. Presidential candidate Donald Trump a month out from the 2024 Presidential election, it is clear that the U.S. is currently politically volatile. International security scholar Barry Buzan states that \"the state is essentially a political entity, political threats may be as much feared as military ones.\" The rise of far right extremism and rhetoric in the U.S., a President that stoked an attack on the U.S. Capital in order to stop the peaceful transfer of power, and a rise in a highly armed population's willingness to use political violence points to the U.S. being a politically vulnerable country. Trump's own former Joint Chief's of Staff Chair and retired U.S. Army General Mark Milley has called Trump \"a total fascist\" and \"the most dangerous person in America.\" Whether the reader agrees with Milley or not, or whether the reader supports Trump or not, a country where the rhetoric is this flammable, at this level, has a big problem.As Buzan states, political threats are dangerous to weak states, \"but even when the state is both strong and powerful, political threats might still be a source of concern. France and Italy in the immediate post-war years were strong on national grounds, but significantly divided in terms of organizing ideology.\" The U.S. is certainly ideologically divided, with political stance now representing a significant part of peoples' identity, and in-group/out-group competitive dynamics are at play. This is concerning; as Buzan points out, powerful states with weak socio-political cohesion have the most to fear from political threats.Not only does the U.S. have developing social and political instability but, despite the surprising resilience of the American economy in the post-covid period, it also has rising economic inequality. A considerable driver of divisiveness is the increasing gap between the ultra-rich and everyone else, and the reduction in the ability of the average person to achieve the American dream. These economic factors have meant that right and left wing populists have more political room to maneuver. Frustration is particularly clear amidst communities that feel left behind by global shifts away from industrial capitalism to towards knowledge and skill-based economies. Meritocracy in America, to the extent that it ever existed, is for all purposes over. Having money already, is the key way to gain access to power and wealth. This adds to the widespread dissatisfaction with the country's politics with many Americans' believing that politics is bought by wealthy special interests and their campaign funds. There is also the divide over the rejection or endorsement of \"hegemonic masculinity\"; the endorsement of which is more likely to be a feature of Trump supporters. All of these growing divides, social, political, economic and cultural are force multipliers in their own right. Unfortunately, these divides are about to come up hard against another force multiplier: climate change.The security threat of climate change looks set to exacerbate domestic inequality. Researchers estimate that almost half of the direct economic damage linked to Hurricane Helene and Milton in Florida is climate change inflicted. Current U.S. President Joseph Biden has stated that Hurricane Milton alone is estimated to have caused $50billion in damage. With hurricane Helene estimated a have caused a further $34billion worth of damage, these two hurricanes have demonstrated that climate intensified weather events are capable of impacting employment and economic growth in the short term even in a country with an economy as large as the U.S.. The health burden from climate change impacts is also set to rise, adding intensity to the already contentious health policy debate. Additionally, in the aftermath of climate change intensified weather events the U.S. military is going to increasingly be called on to help rescue and protect citizens from further harm.The U.S. military has identified that climate change as a security threat that will affect missions, training, supply chains, coastal installations and cause an increased need for the military to assist civic authorities. In addition, the Department of Defense has crafted a climate informed plan to ensure they meet their national defense requirements. Civilian climate change adaptation on the other hand is lagging behind. The new Hunter's Point community in Florida, Pearl Homes, is the first net zero family home development in the U.S. The houses are sustainable, energy efficient and hurricane proof, with streets designed to flood so that the houses don't - but this is an outliner rather than the norm. The country's military is getting ready for climate change, but in the political sphere there are still arguments that delay action to the detriment of citizens.Climate change is a highly politicised wedge issue that cannot be underestimated in terms of political insecurity. In the aftermath of Hurricane Milton, meteorologists in the U.S. reported that they received death threats, whilst Republican representative Marjorie Taylor Greene shared on X, \"Yes, they can control the weather\". It's ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can't be done.\" So, you have this contradictory situation whereby a member of the U.S. House of Representatives is spreading disinformation about climate change whilst the nation's military is bolstering installation resilience to extreme weather to prevent disruptions to operational plans. Moreover, the military recognises that countries that adapt their forces to climate change impacts will secure a strategic advantage over those that don't.From a security perspective, this lack of nationally coordinated effort to address climate change is likely to intensify political divisiveness in the U.S. However, not only will it impact human security inside the U.S., but an internally divided U.S. is vulnerable to foreign information warfare working to stoke existing divides. In an environment with strategic competition is heating up, the Israeli and Ukrainian wars, and with China launching military drills around Taiwan, a U.S. where partisan politics is so extreme it is damaging its security is strategically weaker than its allies feel comfortable with. If the U.S. is looking to highlight strategic competition, it would make sense to address this glaring internal weakness that makes it more vulnerable to information warfare. The high affective polarization in the U.S. incentivises U.S. politicians to instrumentalise divisiveness resulting in high stakes political games in the U.S. over power. If the U.S. renders itself vulnerable, than so is the rules-based order which underpins the defense policies of most of its allies.In the interests of national security, the U.S. demands a new economic and cultural paradigm, one that is designed for this era, and looks to address new challenges such as climate change and the rise of the powerful ultra-rich. Even Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater, the world's biggest hedge fund, is pointing out the risk. As he puts it \"I believe that all good things take to an extreme can be self-destructive and that everything must evolve or die. This is now true for capitalism.\" Inequality hampers economic growth, and this fuels political dysfunction - and dysfunction is significantly higher in the U.S. than in most other developed nations. Inequality can become a security threat. Complicating the picture, climate change is a force multiplier, and will intensify both economic inequality, and quite likely, political divisiveness. These are issues that the U.S. needs to address, or risk this internal divisiveness increasingly becoming a target as strategic competition between the great powers escalates.Endnotes: Buzan, Barry.

    "content": "Mansour notes that while more bets are placed on Trump, the median bet size on Harris is larger.Concerns of manipulation have emerged following former President Donald Trump's 20-point lead over Vice President Kamala Harris on the crypto-based prediction market, Polymarket.The gap -- significantly larger than public opinion polls suggest -- has drawn attention due to the involvement of non-American bettors.Related: On the Radar - Coins to Watch: OM and BONKFour Polymarket accounts -- named Fredi9999, Theo4, PrincessCaro, and Michie -- have reportedly wagered US$30M (AU$44.6M) on Trump winning the 2024 presidential election, boosting Trump's odds to 60% on the decentralised prediction market.And oddly enough, the shift comes despite national polling data from FiveThirtyEight showing a narrow 2.5-point lead for Vice President Kamala Harris over Trump.Arkham Intelligence founder Miguel Morel told the Wall Street Journal \"there's strong reason to believe they are the same entity\" and noted that Arkham found out these accounts were funded through US crypto exchange Kraken.Tarek Mansour, founder of the Kalshi prediction market, refuted claims of manipulation, offering data to support the accuracy of Polymarket's results.Mansour pointed out that while more people are betting on Trump, the median bet size for Harris is larger, with a median of US$85 (AU$126) compared to US$58 (AU$86) for Trump. He emphasised that the 20-point lead on Polymarket aligns with Kalshi's data, where a similar pattern of betting on Trump is observed.However, Mansour clarified that Kalshi is an \"American-only\" platform, countering the idea that foreign bettors are influencing the market.Mansour had to make things simpler for people: more people are just betting on Trump, it is what it is:Related: Analysts Think Uptober Top in for Bitcoin, Memecoin Supercycle Next?Despite Harris leading at points in August and September, Trump's odds surged in early October, further fuelling debates about the role of prediction markets in forecasting elections.

    "title": "The oligarchs' election",
    "content": "facebook iconThe 2024 presidential election, to a degree that surpasses even previous elections, is dominated by a massive level of direct involvement by a handful of billionaires and capitalist oligarchs who control both political parties.This fact was graphically illustrated over the weekend, when the world's richest man, Elon Musk, announced that he would provide a $1 million check each day from now to the election to a randomly selected individual who signs a right-wing petition to uphold the First and Second amendments to the US Constitution. Tesla and X boss Musk (net worth $250 billion) announced the payoff Saturday at a rally he hosted in Pennsylvania to promote the campaign of fascist Republican Donald Trump.The money will come from America PAC, a pro-Trump political action committee set up by Musk with a $75 million donation. America PAC set up the online petition, supposedly directed in support of \"free speech\" (against efforts to curb fascist postings on social media) and individual \"gun rights,\" as interpreted by the ultra-right Supreme Court.The only requirements for the winners is that they are registered voters and live in one of the seven \"battleground\" states, which are the most closely contested in the presidential race: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.Musk has used the online America PAC petition to generate political support for Trump. He first offered $47 for every referral resulting in a signature (the president elected next month, whether Trump or Harris, would be the 47th in US history). He later raised the incentive to $100, before deciding on the latest publicity stunt.Since he fully came on board with the Trump campaign three months ago, Musk has become one of the top four financial backers of the fascist Republican, joining Timothy Mellon (family net worth $14 billion), heir to the banking fortune, who donated $150 million to the Make America Great Again super PAC; Miriam Adelson (net worth $35 billion), who gave $95 million to the Preserve America super PAC; and Richard Uihlein (net worth $6 billion), who pumped $49 million into the Restoration PAC.The section of the ruling class behind Trump is openly breaking with constitutional forms of rule, backing Trump's fascistic attack on the \"enemy within,\" by which is meant all opposition to the policies of the corporate and financial oligarchy.An article in Forbes published last week, however, notes in its headline that \"Kamala Harris Has More Billionaires Prominently Backing Her Than Trump.\" Forbes' breakdown recorded 79 billionaires backing the Democratic candidate, compared to 50 behind the Republican.Among the 28 billionaires who donated at least $1 million to groups supporting Harris are former Google CEO Eric Schmidt (net worth $38 billion); Michael Bloomberg (net worth $105 billion); Home Depot co-founder Arthur Blank (net worth $9.5 billion); and heir to the Cargill food empire Gwendolyn Sontheim Meyer (net worth $5.1 billion), among many others.The leading PAC for the Democratic wing of the capitalist oligarchy, Future Forward, has raised $700 million, mainly from pro-Democratic IT moguls in California's Silicon Valley. Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz has given more than $50 million since 2020, by one report.The PAC money is in addition to the vast sums raised directly by the candidates and the two corporate-controlled parties. According to the latest filings with the Federal Election Commission, fundraising committees for the Harris campaign, the Democratic National Committee and state Democratic Party committees raised $652 million in the third quarter of this year. This was nearly double the $340 million the Trump campaign and the Republican Party raised during the same three months, ending September 30.These massive financial resources are being focused almost entirely on the seven battleground states, and particularly the so-called \"blue wall\" Northern industrial states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, which Trump won in 2016 over Hillary Clinton and lost to Joe Biden in 2020.s, according to the firm AdImpact, $275.1 million for the Democrats and $222.5 million for the Republicans. Michigan is approaching that total, followed by Georgia and Wisconsin.Anyone watching television or going online in a battleground state is immediately bludgeoned with campaign appeals, of a generally fascistic character from Trump (usually demonizing immigrants) or from Harris (portraying the millionaire defender of capitalism as concerned about the conditions of life of working people).The immense role of the capitalist oligarchy is a reflection of the reality of the state, which is not a neutral arbiter but an instrument of class rule.The elections themselves unfold under conditions of a conspiracy of silence on the fundamental issues confronting the population in the United States and the world, including the ongoing genocide in Gaza, the escalation of war in the Middle East and against Russia, the breakdown of democratic forms of rule and the colossal growth of social inequality.And while billionaires compete over the buying of their preferred candidates, any genuine opposition is excluded. Commenting on Musk's $1 million payouts, Socialist Equality Party candidate for president Joseph Kishore noted, \"Third parties and independent candidates in the US are hampered at every turn by a vast array of undemocratic measures, from ballot access laws, to restrictions on coverage, to the censorship by the media.\"Loading Tweet ...Tweet not loading? See it directly on TwitterThe World Socialist Web Site focused attention on the historical significance of this vast social gulf in its 2024 New Year editorial statement. We wrote:All talk about defending democracy and fighting fascism while ignoring the fundamental question of class and economic power -- and, therefore, recognizing the necessity for the mobilization of the working class on a global scale for the overthrow of capitalism -- is cynical and politically impotent demagogy.The wealth of the billionaires must be expropriated, and the gigantic corporations must be transformed, without compensation to the large shareholders, into publicly controlled utilities, run on the basis of social need, not private profit. The anti-democratic institutions and repressive organs of the capitalist state (the professional military, police and intelligence agencies) must be abolished and replaced by organizations of workers' control and power, to establish a democratic and planned economy on a world scale.The experience of the 2024 election campaign has only underscored the truth of this assessment and the urgent necessity for the working class to combine the defense of democracy and democratic rights with the political struggle to expropriate the wealth of the oligarchs.Read moreThe working class, the fight against capitalist barbarism and the building of the World Party of Socialist Revolution(Part Three)5 January 2024The Democratic Party, the Biden campaign crisis and the billionaire \"donor\" class14 July 2024The American oligarchy and the 2024 election20 March 2024Contact usRelated TopicsFind out more about these topics:PerspectivesThe 2024 US Presidential ElectionsUS PoliticsTrump and the danger of fascism in AmericaCapitalism and inequalityUnited StatesNorth America",

    "content": "Republican presidential nominee and former US President Donald Trump works behind the counter during a visit to McDonalds in Feasterville-Trevose, Pennsylvania, US October 20, 2024.With the US presidential election just over two weeks away, Democrat Kamala Harris visited two churches on Sunday while her Republican rival, Donald Trump, visited another kind of American temple: a McDonald's, where he again accused Harris of lying about having previously worked at the fast-food chain.Both candidates were scrambling for votes in the most competitive states, with Harris, the US vice president, appealing to early voters in Georgia and Trump, the former president, campaigning in Pennsylvania ahead of the Nov 5 election.Harris highlighted the heroism of those who responded to Hurricane Helene, which caused deaths and destruction in Florida earlier this month. She drew a contrast between her vision for America and the harsh rhetoric of the current political climate, although she did not mention Trump by name.\"At this point across our nation, what we do see are some trying to deepen division among us, spread hate, sow fear and cause chaos,\" she told thousands of congregants at the New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, in Stonecrest, Georgia.Some measured the strength of a leader as \"who you beat down\" instead of being guided by \"kindness and love,\" she said, urging congregants to vote for a more compassionate future.Harris was more direct in an interview with MSNBC when asked about Trump's comments at an earlier rally in Pennsylvania in which he called her a \"shit vice president,\" telling civil rights leader Al Sharpton: \"The American people deserve so much better.\" At a McDonald's in suburban Philadelphia, Trump removed his suit jacket, put on a black and yellow apron and cooked batches of french fries, something he said he had wanted to do \"all my life.\"The former president dipped wire baskets of potatoes in sizzling oil before salting them and handing them out to some of his supporters through the drive-through window of the restaurant, which had been closed to the general public. Thousands of people lined the street opposite the restaurant to watch.\"I like this job,\" said Trump, whose adoration for fast food has been well chronicled. \"I'm having a lot of fun here.\"Trump has said the McDonald's visit was intended in part as a jab at Harris, who says she worked at the fast-food chain during her college years in California. Trump claims Harris never worked there but has provided no evidence to back that up.Harris spokesperson Ian Sams said the stunt was a sign of the real-estate mogul's desperation.\"All he knows how to do is lie,\" he said. \"He can't understand what it's like to have a summer job because he was handed millions on a silver platter, only to blow it.\"The Harris campaign said Trump's visit also belied his opposition to an increase in the federal minimum wage and his support for a rule that could make it more difficult for workers to win legal claims against the parent company if a franchise owner violated minimum-wage and overtime laws.Harris, who was raised in the teachings of the Black church and sang in a church choir, marked her 60th birthday on Sunday while campaigning outside of Atlanta.At Divine Faith Ministries International in Jonesboro, Georgia, music icon Stevie Wonder performed, singing his hit \"Higher Ground\" and a version of Bob Marley's \"Redemption Song.\"Asked about polls showing a lack of enthusiasm for her candidacy among Black men who have been a reliable voting bloc for Democrats, Harris told Sharpton she was working to earn their votes as well.\"There's this narrative about what kind of support we are receiving from Black men that is just not panning out in reality,\" Harris said. \"Because why would Black men be any different than any other demographic of voter? They expect that you earn their vote.\"Harris will need strong results in the majority non-white cities of Detroit and Atlanta and their surrounding suburbs to repeat President Joe Biden's 2020 wins in Michigan and Georgia.At a campaign event in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Trump extended birthday wishes to Harris, drawing boos from his crowd.\"Happy birthday, and many more, and I mean it,\" Trump said, although he continued to criticise Harris's policies and speculating that his opponent may have \"a cognitive problem.\"",

    "title": "The Orbanization Of America: Hungary's Lessons For Donald Trump - Analysis",
    "content": "\"There is a great man, a great leader in Europe -- Viktor Orban. ... He is the prime minister of Hungary. He is a very great leader, a very strong man.\" - Donald Trump, January 2024.Hungary's Viktor Orban is arguably the most successful populist leader in the world today. Since he became prime minister for the second time in 2010, he has transformed Hungary into what many describe as an \"illiberal democracy\". Over those 14 years, he has seized control of nearly all the institutions of the state and most of the media, and has put increasing pressure on civil society in Hungary. Competitive elections persist, but Orban's control over the media and the skewed electoral system help ensure his Hungarian Civic Alliance (Fidesz) party continues to win overwhelming majorities. At a time of fierce anti-incumbency sentiment, Orban is currently the longest-serving leader in the European Union and the longest-serving prime minister in Hungary's post-communist history.As former president Donald Trump implies, Republicans in the United States have noticed Orban's success. Many are looking to the Hungarian example to understand how a second Trump administration might succeed at transforming America in a way that the first one never managed.Orban, after all, also lost power after his first term as prime minister (1998-2002). He accepted that defeat, but Fidesz too planted a seed of doubt about electoral fraud committed by the then-opposition parties. Orban then spent eight years in opposition nursing grievances against the socialists and liberals. In his view, they stood not for the nation but for capitalist and foreign interests and threatened the creation of the \"civic Hungary\" he sought to build.Upon returning to power in 2010, Orban and his advisers concludedthat the source of Hungary's problems in the preceding eight years had been the weakness of the executive and the state, which was vulnerable to capture by private business interests. With the constitutional majority now in their hands, they set out to build the so-called System of National Cooperation, in which the governing parties would strengthen the state and, more importantly, the governing parties' grip on it. A newly empowered executive would allow for the implementation of their agenda that, according to their slogan, put the interests of \"the nation\" in the forefront.The concentration of power that Orban achieved after 2010 largely did away with institutional constraints and silenced dissent. For the many who served in the Trump administration who blame liberal bias and obstructionism for their implementation problems, the Hungarian experience is an inspiration. In their view, the first Trump administration fell short on implementing presidential promises such as building a wall on the border, withdrawing from NATO and Afghanistan, or ending the trade deficit with China not because of incompetence but due to a liberal bias and obstructionism in the state administration.Accordingly, removing checks and balances of all kinds is the only way to counter what they see as entrenched liberal control of key governmental and civil society institutions, including the civil service, NGOs, higher education, finance, the media, and the technology industry. As the preface to The Heritage Foundation's Mandate for Leadership evocatively puts it, \"he long march of cultural Marxism through our institutions has come to pass. The federal government is a behemoth, weaponized against American citizens and conservative values.\" In this view, even Trump's own \"establishment\" political appointees, unconsciously infused with liberal values, often betrayed him and frustrated his agenda.The now infamous Heritage Foundation-led Project 2025, directed by Paul Dans, the former head of Trump's White House Personnel Office, contains at its heart the idea that liberal control of the \"administrative state\" and civil society have long stymied conservative governance and must be overcome for Trump to govern effectively. It avows that the primary effort of a second Trump administration will be to \"dismantle the administrative state and return self-governance to the American people.\"As part of that effort, they are seeking to learn from Orban's success in Hungary. But how did he manage to exercise control over Hungary and can the lessons from Hungary be exported to the very different context of the US? This policy brief seeks to answer those questions. It looks at how Orban seized control of Hungary, what US Republicans have learned from that experience, and whether and how they might translate in American context. We call it the Orbanisation of America.\"Modern Hungary is not just a model for conservative statecraft, but the model. Americans, Brits, Spaniards, Australians -- everyone -- can and should learn from it.\" Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, The Hungarian Conservative, December 2022.Liberal democracies are increasingly less likely to collapse due to coups d'états or blatant electoral fraud. More frequently, they are underminedby state-led erosion of their institutions and electoral manipulation. Hungary under Orban serves as the paradigmatic example of this type of modern democratic erosion. Since 2010, Hungary has experienced a gradual but severe democratic decline driven by these initially democratically elected officials, who expanded their grip on power while upholding the façade of democracy.After a period of domestic political and economic crisis in Hungary in the late 2000s, Fidesz won Hungary's 2010 parliamentary election with 52.7 per cent of the popular vote. That slim majority nonetheless translated into two-thirds of the seats in the national assembly for the governing coalition. The Christian Democrats have served continuously as Orban's junior coalition partner for the last 14 years. They are, however, entirely politically dependent on Fidesz and have no clear separate political programme or agenda. The effective super-majority commanded by Fidesz allowed Orban to put the legislative branch in the uncontested service of the executive, pass and amend any legislation, and even rewrite the constitutional rules of the democratic game. In April 2011, after only a year in power, the governing majority adopted the so-called Fundamental Law, Hungary's new constitution, without any consultation with opposition parties or the public. As Orban himself put it, \"we need to win only once, but we need to win big.\"Orban paired his authoritarian approach to governance with an ideology that has been steadily shifting toward the far right over the past decade. The government adopted a populist and nativist rhetoric that targets various external and internal groups - including critics of the government as well as various minorities and vulnerable groups - as potential threats to the country, its population, and its culture. In doing so, the government engineered a permanent sense of crisis in its public communication. This type of threat inflation has fuelled polarisation, solidified Orban's base and served as a reason to adopt various \"emergency\" measures. This process of executive aggrandisement - the concentration of power and takeover of state institutions - eliminated the checks and balances from the system that could have held the executive accountable and guaranteed the rights and protection of political, ethnic, religious, and other minorities. By the early 2020s this had transformed the country into an electoral autocracy.After coming to power, Orban's government started to weaken horizontal accountability by undermining judicial independence. In 2010, a key legislative amendment allowed justices of the Constitutional Court to be elected by a two-thirds parliamentary majority, replacing the previous model that sought to find consensus about nominations among all parliamentary forces. The number of justices was increased from 11 to 15, their mandates were extended from 9 to 12 years, the retirement age limit was abolished, and the right to elect the Constitutional Court president was transferred from the court to the parliament. These changes enabled the nomination of justices loyal to Fidesz and, by 2013, pro-government justices held the majority. Additionally, the court's authority to review budget-related laws was annulled, allowing the government to implement economic policies without judicial oversight during Hungary's economic and financial crisis.In 2011, the Fidesz government passed further reforms that reconfigured the court system. Most importantly, it abolished the National Judiciary Council, which oversaw the judicial branch, and replaced it with two new bodies: the National Judicial Council, a self-governing body composed of judges that exercises supervisory functions over the judiciary, and the National Office of the Judiciary, responsible for the central administration of the country's courts, whose head was subsequently elected by the parliament. This reform ensured that Tunde Hando, wife of Fidesz MEP Jozsef Szajer - who wrote the Fundamental Law - could take the post. The government also lowered judges' retirement age to 62, forcing the removal of 274 judges and allowing the NOJ president to fill these positions. The European Court of Justice deemed the removal of the judges illegal, but the situation was not reversed. In 2020, further centralisation took placewith reforms strengthening the Curia, Hungary's highest court. These reforms required lower courts to follow Curia decisions, while the Curia in turn was mandated to run legal unity reviews should a lower court wish to deviate from its case law. The following year, Fidesz appointed Zsolt Andras Varga, a loyalist and former Constitutional Court justice with no prior judicial experience, as Curia president, increasing political control over the judiciary.The nomination of loyalists to the helm of state institutions played a central role in the consolidation of power by Fidesz. Besides taking over the constitutional court and filling the highest positions in the judiciary with loyalists, the prosecutor general (Peter Polt, 2010-) and the president of the State Audit Office (Laszlo Domonkos, 2011-22), among others, were also former members of Fidesz. In certain cases, Fidesz also expanded the term of its political appointees well beyond a governmental cycle, cementing the party's political influence in the system should it lose parliamentary elections (more on which below).Securing the loyalty of the president of the republic was another crucial aspect of Fidesz's strategy. Although the role of president is largely symbolic, the office signs laws into effect and has the right to challenge the constitutionality of legislation passed by parliament. After the mandate of President Laszlo Solyom, an independent legal scholar and former Constitutional Court justice, ended in 2010, Fidesz nominated and with its two-thirds majority elected Pal Schmitt, at that time a Fidesz MEP. Schmitt showed great loyalty to his party and refrained from using his control functions as president. In fact, he openly expressed his commitment to the government's legislative agenda.The nomination of party politicians as president and their subsequent compliant attitude continued beyond Schmitt. Fidesz politician Janos Ader, author of the 2011 judiciary reform and president from 2012 to 2022, at times used his veto powers, but did not position himself as an independent counterweight or check on the government's authority. His successor, Katalin Novak, who held office until February 2024, was a former vice-president of Fidesz and member of Orban's government before her presidency; she was also fully aligned with the government both politically and ideologically.The path to electoral autocracy is a dangerous one, even for the leader who paves it. By definition, it creates an executive authority that is too powerful to give up. As one Polish politician put it in the lead-up to the 2023 general election following eight years of gradual shift towards electoral autocracy, \"this election is about whether we go to jail or they go to jail.\" As autocratisation unfolds and the electoral stakes increase, leaders will naturally use their executive authority to tilt elections in their favour in any way they can.To maintain its grip on power, the Hungarian government periodically amended the electoral law, a document which establishes the rules of elections. The government started with an overhaul in 2011 that reduced the parliament's size to 199 members and redrew the electoral map, raising concerns about gerrymandering. Adopted unilaterally without consultations with the opposition parties, the reform strengthened majoritarian elements over proportional ones, increasing the importance of single-mandate constituencies and ultimately favouring the strongest political force.Of the 199 seats, 106 are now from single-mandate districts and 93 are allocated proportionally. The new law also permitted Hungarian citizens without registered addresses in the country to vote via mail, benefiting those who gained citizenship through Fidesz's 2010 simplified naturalisation process. Further amendments before the 2018 and 2022 general elections also favoured the governing parties. Last-minute changes in 2022, for example, disrupted the strategy of opposition parties, which were forced to submit a joint national list to be able to stand a chance against Fidesz. Due to these legislative adjustments, coupled with uneven campaign finances, misuse of state funds, and restricted media access for the opposition, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe has deemed Hungarian elections since 2014 free but not fair.Fidesz has also tightened its control of the media. In 2010 it pushed through a constitutional amendment that removed the obligation to prevent media monopolies and established the National Media and Infocommunication Authority (known as the Media Authority) as the media regulator. Its president, former Fidesz member Annamaria Szalai, was elected for a nine-year term by a two-thirds parliamentary majority. The Media Authority and its Media Council, which is responsible for regulating content, gained the authority to monitor media, issue penalties, and suspend operations of outlets that it deems present \"unbalanced\" or \"amoral\" content. The centralisation of state media operations and content production under the Media Service Support and Asset Management Fund (MTVA), controlled by the Media Council, effectively ended the ability of public media to operate independently as it enabled censorship and governmental interference in editorial practices.Fidesz has also expanded its influence over non-state media. Business circles linked to the party established new outlets and acquired existing ones, which were then financially supported through state advertising. Later on, the Central European Press and Media Foundation, established in 2018 and led by individuals close to Fidesz, acquired these outlets and ultimately merged 28 companies comprising around 500 outlets. Notably, this conglomerate was exempted from competition law by the government, which declared the acquisitions of \"national strategic importance\". The exemption was challenged in court, but the Constitutional Court dismissed the case.As a result, Hungary's media landscape today is dominated by pro-government outlets that support Fidesz's political agenda. These outlets often run smear campaigns to discredit journalists and experts, making widespread use of elaborate conspiracy theories. In some of these cases, video material used of the targets of the smear campaigns was later revealed to be the result of covert intelligence operations carried out by Israeli private firm Black Cube.What is left of independent media faces sanctions, hostility, and surveillance. A notable example is Klubradio, a radio station critical of the government that had its broadcasting licence revoked by the Media Council for alleged breaches of the media law. Despite legal challenges, the revocation was upheld, prompting the EU to launch an infringement procedure. Klubradio now operates online.In 2021, investigative journalists revealed that about 300 Hungarian citizens, including many journalists, were targeted with Pegasus, a spyware developed by the Israeli cyber-arms company NSO Group. Although the software had been purchased by the Hungarian state, a later investigation by the government-controlled Hungarian National Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of Information concludedthat no laws were breached when it was used, resulting in no practical consequences.Over the years, Fidesz has enacted a series of restrictive laws targeting NGOs that are critical of the government. The 2017 Lex NGO law required NGOs receiving funds from non-Hungarian sources above a certain amount to register as \"organisations funded from abroad\". In 2020, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) found that law in breach of EU legislation, but the government repealed it only the following year. In 2018, the \"Stop Soros\" law package adopted by the governing parties criminalised aiding asylum seekers. The ECJ also ruled against that, but the package remains in effect. In 2021, a law mandated the State Audit Office (SAO) to audit NGOs with annual budgets exceeding 20m forints every two years, classifying them as \"civic organisations engaging in activities likely to influence public life\". The SAO, which previously only dealt with public funding, thus gained the ability to oversee how NGOs spend private funds.In 2023, the Fidesz government adopted the Sovereignty Protection Act, reminiscent of similar Russian foreign agent legislation. It established the Sovereignty Protection Authority (SPA), tasked with protecting the country against foreign interference. Led by Tamas Lanczi, the former director of Fidesz's think-tank Szazadveg and a former president of MTVA online, the SPA has broad and unchecked powers to investigate the activities of civil society organisations and media outlets to determine if they receive funding from abroad. The SPA has the authority to obtain data from any state or local government body, as well as other organisations. It may refer cases it investigates to the relevant authority to initiate infringement or criminal procedures should it identify what it considers irregularities. It also prepares public reports about its findings, and there is no forum to appeal against these reports or the broader activities of the SPA. Since key concepts were not defined in the law, the SPA retains significant discretion to interpret its mandate, giving its inquiries virtually unlimited scope.In May 2024, the SPA published its first report, which was an investigation into alleged illicit foreign financing of opposition parties' campaign for the 2022 parliamentary election. It concluded that a network of US-based actors continues to seek to influence politics in central Europe, including in Hungary, and threaten the integrity of elections. The investigation relied on covertly recorded videos of individuals connected to Action for Democracy, a US-based NGO led by a former adviser of Budapest's opposition mayor. In June 2024, the authority launched its first comprehensive investigation against anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International Hungary and the investigative journalism portal Atlatszo, adding to concerns that the SPA will be used to put pressure on critical voices. The authority claimsthat these organisations use foreign funding to seek to influence \"the will of the voters\".Fidesz's permanent parliamentary control has been critical in consolidating its power. Equally crucial has been its populist and nativist rhetoric, through which it provides an ideological justification for its state capture. Already after his 2002 electoral defeat when Orban proclaimed that \"the country cannot be in opposition\", and especially following then-prime minister Ferenc Gyurcsany's infamous leaked speech admitting to having lied in the campaign of the 2006 parliamentary election, Fidesz fostered an 'us' v 'them' narrative, attacking the ruling socialist-liberal coalition and positioning itself and its leader, Orban, as the true representatives of the Hungarian people.As EU criticism of the Hungarian government's anti-democratic measures grew in the early 2010s, Fidesz began portraying the EU, \"Brussels\", the \"liberal elite\", and critical politicians as enemies of the Hungarian people. The government and pro-government media often depicted domestic NGOs and civil society organisations that were critical of the government as paid agents - often by George Soros - serving foreign interests. Additionally, in 2015, the government's rhetoric took a clear turn to the right as it started focusing on \"illegal migrants\" as threats to Hungary and Christian culture. This especially put NGOs advocating for the human rights of refugees and asylum seekers, such as the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, in the government's crosshairs. In one manifestation of growing pressure on critical and dissenting voices, in 2018, a pro-government magazine published a \"blacklist\" of individuals it claimed were working to implement the will of George Soros in Hungary.Fidesz has also increasingly delved into the realm of identity politics and culture wars. As the immediate pressure of the refugee and migration crisis faded, the government identified a new 'threat' to Hungarian families and children: sexual minorities. In 2021, it adopted a so-called anti-paedophile law that gained a strong homophobic character when, by the introduction of amendments regarding sexual minorities, the law conflated homosexuality and paedophilia. These amendments banned the portrayal and \"promotion\" of homosexuality and the display of content \"promoting\" homosexuality and sex reassignment to minors. Since 2023, the law has been used to impose fines on bookshops that did not display children's books featuring LGBT+ characters in closed wrapping.The government continues to identify new threats to the nation, perpetually fuelling a sense of crisis. This strategy serves to distract the public from the failures and shortcomings of Fidesz's governance and to provide a justification for the government's onslaught against NGOs, media outlets, and journalists that attempt to hold the government accountable.While watchdogs and critical NGOs face mounting pressure, civil society actors aligned with Fidesz have flourished since Orban's return to power. A prominent example is the Civil Cooperation Forum (COF), which plays a key role in mobilising support for the government. The COF often runs pro-government billboard campaigns and is the organiser of the so-called peace marches, which at sensitive times have brought thousands to the streets to show support for Fidesz's policies.Various think-tanks and research centres with ties to Fidesz, such as the Szazadveg, the Nezopont Institute, the XXI Century Institute, the Danube Institute, and the Center for Fundamental Rights have provided intellectual justification for the government's agenda. In parallel, government-friendly figures have gained increased support and prominence in the cultural sector, which has emerged as a key battleground for the government's identity politics. Aligning with Fidesz's personnel strategy, party politicians and individuals close to Fidesz were appointed to head various museums, such as the Hungarian National Museum and the Petofi Literary Museum.Fidesz also strengthened its grip on the educational sphere, leading to increased centralisation of public education and diminished teacher autonomy. In higher education, the government established the well funded National University of Public Service, tasked to train the next generation of civil servants, including police and military officers. Meanwhile, most Hungarian public universities had their governance structure overhauled in ways that undermined their autonomy. They were placed under the supervision of so-called public asset management foundations, the boards of which had members with close ties to the government, including prominent Fidesz politicians and even ministers. In response, the European Commission suspended 21 universities in 2023 from the Erasmus+ scholarship programme because of concerns over corruption and conflict of interest.In parallel, the operations of the Matthias Corvinus College (MCC), a private college close to Fidesz, were expanded after the governing majority handed over the state's ownership of a large share of stocks in Hungary's two leading companies to the asset management foundation behind MCC in 2010. It now runs programmes from primary school to university and recruits students from Hungary and Hungarian minorities in neighbouring countries, with the aim of creating an ideologically aligned intellectual elite. The chair of the college's board of trustees is the prime minister's political director.One of the tools most recently used by the government to consolidate its power is the abuse of the exceptional legal regime of the state of emergency (veszélyhelyzet). For many years after the 2015-16 peak of the refugee arrivals, the government maintained that the country was in a constant state of crisis. Then, in 2020, the covid-19 pandemic provided the justification to institute a state of emergency that allowed it to govern by decree, as well as to suspend or bypass existing legislation with few constraints. The parliament also enacted a provision that allowed decrees to remain in force beyond the then-constitutionally prescribed 15-day limit.The government did not limit the scope of these decrees to tackling the pandemic. In the absence of judiciary oversight, it frequently overreached. Later, parliament passed amendments to the Fundamental Law that created new justifications for renewing the state of emergency and to prolong the validity of the decrees. As a result, until the present day Hungary has been governed under a state of emergency for over four years under various pretexts - currently the reason is the war in neighbouring Ukraine - sidelining both the standard rules of the governance process and other actors in it.\"We have entered the programme-writing system of President Donald Trump's team, and we have deep involvement there.\" Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban, July 2024.NGOs and think-tanks close to Fidesz play an increasingly important role in establishing and strengthening ties with international partners.These organisations have focused primarily on deepening cooperation with like-minded groups, scholars, public intellectuals, journalists, and media personalities abroad while promoting the Hungarian government's culturally conservative and sovereigntist vision and policies. This track of international alliance-building became particularly prominent towards the US after the first meeting of Orban and Trump in 2019. Previously, the Hungarian government relied on the efforts of Hungarian organisations based in the US, such as the Hungary Foundation and diaspora organisations, as well as paid and registered American lobbyists, such as Connie Mack and David Reaboi, and various lobby organisations.Once Fidesz found its counterparts on the right wing of the Republican party in the early 2020s, a new influence-building strategy emerged, including a new set of actors. This new circle of organisations most prominently include the Danube Institute and the Center for Fundamental Rights. The Danube Institute, established by the Lajos Batthyany Foundation in 2013 as a conservative, economically liberal, and Atlanticist organisation, provided fellowships for American right-wing and alt-right personalities such as Rod Dreher, Christopher F. Rufo, Michael O'Shea, and many others. As visiting researchers, they studied and, in their writings, promoted the Hungarian government's views and practice in the US, for example in areas such as family policy.The Danube Institute also established cooperation with The Heritage Foundation. In 2023, it committed to the joint organisation of an annual geopolitical conference and to hosting visiting researchers from The Heritage Foundation to study Hungarian policies in various fields. Through cooperation with right-wing intellectuals abroad, the Danube Institute has proved instrumental in promoting the culturally conservative vision of Orban's Hungary.The Center for Fundamental Rights, also established in 2013 as an institute focusing on political and legal analysis, pursues an agenda in support of the Hungarian government's views. Its self-proclaimed goal is to counter political correctness and what it refers to as human rights fundamentalism. The institute also has established connections with The Heritage Foundation and organised the first European spin-off of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Hungary in 2022. Since then, CPAC Hungary has provided an annual platform for the networking of Hungarian, American, and European figures of the far-right, as well as an opportunity for the international diffusion and amplification of their policy and political platforms. The Center for Fundamental Rights played a key role in establishing connections also in political circles through frequent visits by its staff to the US.From the Hungarian perspective, this strategy has indeed delivered a strong American connection in recent years. It is not only the Hungarian prime minister who promotes the country as \"a conservative island\". Kevin Roberts, the president of The Heritage Foundation and the man behind Project 2025, had already in 2022 spoken of the country not only as a model of conservative statecraft, but as the model. In May 2024, Heritage even welcomed Orban for a closed-door lecture in Washington, DC.\"I think Orban made smart decisions that we could learn from in the US.\" - Republican vice-presidential candidate J.D. Vance, CBS Face the Nation, June 2024.Orban has shown how to use institutional reform, the regulation of civil society, and the power of the state to gradually erode the essence of liberal democracy and build an electoral autocracy. The US context, however, is vastly different from that in Hungary. So how might the Hungarian experience translate in the US context?One important distinction between the US and Hungary is that the American president faces an independent legislature and a strong judiciary. Even if the president's party controls Congress, he does not exercise anything approaching parliamentary control of the legislature, nor is he is likely to have a \"constitutional majority\", which in the US requires not only two-thirds control of Congress, but also control of three-quarters of the state legislatures.The US route to electoral autocracy therefore means, in the first instance, creating a powerful executive that can overwhelm the other branches. Since at least the Reagan administration, various Republican thinkers have been promoting unitary executive theory. According to proponents of this idea, the power of the presidency has been unconstitutionally hobbled by limits placed by the courts, Congress, and the civil service rules on the president's ability to control the executive branch. As a result, the president no longer controls his own branch of government and cannot implement the mandate the voters have given him. The unitary executive project therefore is to restore control of the executive branch to the president.The issue of whether unitary executive theory conforms with the US constitution is a very controversial one, but the likely effects of its implementation on governance in the US are fairly clear. Over recent decades, power in Washington has flowed increasingly to the executive branch. A divided and understaffed Congress struggles to exercise its oversight function effectively over the vast executive branch. The courts are similarly too slow and lacking in administrative capacity to constrain the president on most issues. The 2024 Supreme Court decision in Trump v the United States, which asserted that the president enjoys near-total immunity in his official acts, has given the president yet more power relative to Congress and the courts.Arguably, the principal source of checks and balances in Washington now resides within the executive branch. Independent agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, technical agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, and specially chartered institutions such as the Federal Reserve and the Justice Department's special prosecutors, all to varying degrees escape direct presidential authority.The unitary executive project would recover the president's power to control the executive branch, thus cementing his control over governance generally. This resonates with the Hungarian experience, which demonstrates that strong control of the government's executive functions is the key to being able to eventually establish control over the broader institutions of governance and civil society.But increasing executive branch power does not come naturally to the Republican Party, which has long preached an ethic of small government and individual freedom. Here, the Hungarian example has been instructive. As one pro-regime Hungarian interlocutor put it to us, \"we have showed the Republicans how you can use the power of the state\" to accomplish policy goals and break the power of liberal ideology on civil society.The message appears to have been received. In a video on his campaign website that echoes the claims of unitary executive theorists, Trump vowed to bring the independent agencies \"under presidential authority, as the Constitution demands.\" As Russell Vought, Trump's former budget director and the policy director of the Republican platform committee explained, \"what we're trying to do is identify the pockets of independence and seize them.\" Even the Federal Reserve Board, which sets US monetary policy and is arguably the crown jewel of Washington's independent agencies, is not exempt.But, of course, Trump's most important effort to achieve stronger executive control will probably involve the Justice Department. The president appoints the 93 US attorneys, the regional Justice Department officials who act as the chief federal prosecutor within their geographic jurisdiction. Traditionally, US presidents have not interfered in prosecution decisions by the US attorneys. But Trump has explicitly said that he might fire US attorneys who refuse to prosecute on his orders. This implies that, should he return to office, the presidential authority could extend to determining whether to prosecute.Additionally, Trump has often threatened to use this power against his political opponents, including President Joe Biden and his family. Trump's message in this regard so blatant that he often capitalises it. \"WHEN I WIN ,\" he warned on Truth Social in September 2024, \"those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law, which will include long term prison sentences. ... Those involved in unscrupulous behavior will be sought out, caught, and prosecuted at levels, unfortunately, never seen before in our Country.\"It is not an idle threat. The Supreme Court's decision in Trump v the United States confirms that the president has the power to make these decisions and that no court can question his motives for doing so.The most important step for taking control of the executive branch is personnel. The federal government is a large and unwieldy ship that any administration struggles to turn, and turn to its purposes. The Trump administration that took office in 2017 appeared to struggle even more than most to bend the US government bureaucracy to its will. Their struggles resulted, in part, because they had not expected to win and had not undertaken the extensive transition preparation that most incoming administrations do. (Trump fired the entire leadership of his transition team, including its head, New Jersey governor Chris Christie, two days after the 2016 election.) Trump administration veterans believe, however, that their challenges stemmed less from a lack of preparation than from a lack of suitable personnel.In the US, there are two parts to this problem. The first part involves disloyal political appointees. Because Trump had not expected to govern in 2017, his transition team had not identified and vetted many potential candidates to take up the more than 4,000 political appointments that a president needs to make to the executive branch. In a host of areas, including for some very senior positions such as secretary of defence, the Trump team was forced to select from among the traditional Republican elite. These people often did not carry out his orders, such as to withdraw from NATO or to use the military to disperse Black Lives Matter demonstrators. Some resigned in protest at key moments, others actively undermined his agenda from the inside.The second part is the civil service, which former Trump officials believe is infused with liberal bias. As one member of the Project 2025 team noted to us, federal civil servants nearly all live in Washington, DC and its surrounding suburbs, an area that votes over 90 per cent for Democratic candidates. It follows from simple math that the overwhelming majority of federal workers vote for the Democrats. To prove this point, Trump's former secretary of the interior, David Bernhardt, wrote a book, \"You Report to Me\", to document in exhaustive detail \"how unaccountable power has been concentrated deep within the administrative state.\"The Trump administration had identified and begun to deal with these problems even before the end of its term in 2021. Two weeks before the 2020 election, Trump's team promulgated what seemed at the time an arcane reform of the civil service in an executive order laboriously titled \"Creating Schedule F in the Excepted Service\". The Schedule F reform would have given the president the power to fire approximately 50,000 civil servants across the federal government who occupied positions deemed linked to policymaking.That period also provides clues to Trump's plan for dealing with disloyal political appointees. In the days following the 2020 election, as part of his efforts to claim he had won, Trump ordered his administration to begin implementing his second-term plan. This revealed his intention to install loyalists in key positions in various department and agencies, particularly the Defence Department, the intelligence community, and the Justice Department, to better control his own government.After Trump left office in January 2021 and Biden immediately rescinded Schedule F, nothing much came of these efforts. But the broader Republican ecosystem has used the period since then to refine and widen these plans. Trump himself has promised that his next term \"will demolish the deep state\" and \"throw off the sick political class that hates our country.\"At the same time, a new Trump administration would not necessarily need to fire tens of thousands of civil servants. It would simply need to demonstrate that it could and would - and then most of the existing civil servants would fall in line. \"The mere mention of Schedule F,\" says Vought, \"ensures that the bureaucracy moves in your direction.\"To ensure more loyal political appointees, Heritage's Project 2025 has created a database of some 20,000 pre-vetted potential officials. The Trump campaign has strongly repudiated Project 2025, but it will likely value that database nonetheless if Trump wins the election. There is simply no place else to go for so many loyal officials.Another lesson from the Hungarian experience is the importance of reining in other governmental power centres beyond the executive. As noted, in the US, unlike Hungary, the first and most important element in this effort is to bring the legislature to heel. Broadly speaking, the US Congress has two sources of leverage vis-à-vis the executive: the power to set the budget and the power to confirm appointees. Even as the Republican Party works to assure a compliant Republican majority in Congress, a future Trump administration would likely challenge each of these sources of leverage.On the budget, the Trump administration would likely revive a practice known as impounding funds in which the president refuses to spend money that Congress appropriates. \"I will use the President's long-recognized impoundment power,\" Trump declared in a campaign video, \"to squeeze the federal bureaucracy for massive savings.\"His administration would also likely expand the president's power to redirect funds appropriated by Congress to the president's priorities. In 2020, after Congress blocked funding to build a wall along the southern border, the Trump administration simply redirected hundreds of millions of dollars from Pentagon spending in Europe. Various members of Congress expressed frustration, but Congress as an institution lacked sufficient unity to reverse the decision. There is little reason to believe the situation would be any different in a second term in which Republicans held a majority in at least one house of Congress. If the executive can not only refrain from spending money that Congress has appropriated but also redirect funding to priorities Congress chose not to finance, it raises questions about Congress's actual budgetary authority.The Trump administration also pioneered some novel ways around the requirement that the US Senate must confirm all senior political appointees to the executive branch. During his term, Trump often left key positions vacant across the federal government. In the Justice Department, for example, according to a report from the Brookings Institution and the Partnership for Public Service, Trump left 31 per cent of Senate-confirmed positions continuously vacant, with 55 per cent still unfilled by late 2020.Beyond the sheer number of vacancies, the Trump administration also made much greater use than any previous administration of \"acting\" officials, officials supposedly in post temporarily while awaiting confirmation or replacement. \"I sort of like 'acting'\", Trump explainedin 2019. \"It gives me more flexibility; ... I like 'acting.'\" Trump further demonstrated a willingness to put into place officials that the Senate had already rejected, including Ken Cucinelli, who became acting deputy secretary of homeland security, and Anthony Tata, who became \"the official performing the duties of under-secretary of defence for Policy,\" avoiding even the fairly loose rules that regulate acting appointments.This expansive use of vacancies, actings, and \"officials performing the duties\" would seem to seriously erode the Senate's capacity to exercise leverage on the executive branch. But, again, political polarisation meant that the Senate lacked the unity to raise any formal objection to these practices during Trump's term. There is every reason to believe that they would continue and expand if he was re-elected, particularly if the Republicans control the Senate.In both Hungary and the US, the judiciary is an important potential check that could prevent democracy sinking into electoral autocracy. As noted above, in Hungary, establishing effective control of the judiciary was a key early arena in Orban's efforts to consolidate control over the country. In the US, which has a very powerful judiciary, that struggle has been under way for quite some time. Since at least the 1990s, both parties have made appointing \"friendly\" judges a priority when they hold the White House; by and large, judges have proven true to their ideological affiliations. The Republicans, however, have been more successful, particularly at the Supreme Court and Appeals Court levels where they hold majorities, despite only having held for the presidency for 12 of the last 32 years.Beyond continuing the strategy of republicanisation of the judiciary, a future Trump administration's plans for consolidating control of the judicial branch remain vague. Trump has frequently engaged in personal attacks against judges for rulings he disagrees with, which might serve to delegitimise court decisions and intimidate some judges. Although Trump has expressed his willingness to comply with court orders, ignoring the courts remains a possibility. His running mate, J.D. Vance, is less circumspect. \"When the courts stop you,\" he told a podcast in 2021, \"stand before the country like Andrew Jackson did and say, 'the chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him enforce it.'\" In fact, unlike in Hungary where the EU can exercise leverage over the government, in the US there is little power by any actor to prevent open defiance of judicial authorities by the executive.The Hungarian example demonstrates that, as executive power increases, elections become much more consequential. In the US, the growing power of the presidency has inspired increasing efforts by both parties to tilt or even rig the electoral rules through mechanisms such as redistricting, voter registration drives, restricting voter access, media fairness doctrines, campaign finance laws, and multiple other mechanisms. Of course, these efforts have long existed and many of them are perfectly legal and legitimate.But the looming threat of electoral autocracy has increased the stakes. Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election and - to date - the failure to hold him to account for those actions has broadened controversies over issues of voter fraud, procedures for counting ballots, election certification, and the power of state legislatures to use fraud accusations to overturn election results. Republicans under Trump have, in the manner of Fidesz, stoked the false narrative that US elections are rife with fraud, which justifies efforts to change rules and take extraordinary measures after election day to \"ensure free and fair elections\".In the US, much of this manipulation happens at the state level because the states administer the election for the federal office. (The US presidential election is effectively over 50 separate elections.) The results of the 2022 midterm elections put the government of most of the swing states in Democratic or mixed hands (that is, one party controls the legislature, the other the governorship), which limits the ability of the Republicans to impose new electoral laws. The only exception is Georgia, where Republicans are currently engaged in an effort to give themselves the power to delay or even overturn election results based on their views of possible fraud.The Georgia effort prefigures what Republicans and Trump himself have signalled to be a comprehensive push to reform the electoral law if they were to win the presidency. In 2022 and 2023, for example, Congressional Republicans introduced the American Confidence in Elections Act, which included a broad package of election reforms based on the idea of widespread voter fraud, including concerns over voting by immigrants. It includes mechanisms for purging the voter rolls of individuals deemed suspicious, limiting voter registration and access, and undercutting the impartiality of election administration. It would also further loosen campaign finance rules to allow larger and less transparent donations.One new area of contestation for a Trump administration could be an effort to regulate the media and non-government organisations. Trump, along with many other Republicans, have consistently alleged that the media is hopelessly biased and even corruptly prejudiced against him. To cite just one example of thousands, Trump claimed without citing any evidence that ABC, the television network hosting his first presidential debate with Vice-President Kamala Harris, leaked the debate questions to her in advance. Over time, this anti-media discourse has had an effect. Trust in the media is at an all-time low among Americans and especially Republicans. Other institutions of civil society such as schools and the criminal justice system have similar image problems.These attacks have laid the groundwork to undermine the media and civil society. Taking a page from Orban's playbook, a Trump administration would likely not resort to heavy-handed tactics, such as shuttering newspapers and sending journalists to prison. Rather, it would use federal regulatory mechanisms, including the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department, and the Internal Revenue Service, to break up the \"liberal hegemony\" over civil society, unironically adopting the supposed liberal playbook of using the administrative state to enforce ideological conformity. This might involve new uses of fairness doctrines to shape media content and new criteria for determining the non-profit status of NGOs, which is relevant for tax exemption purposes. Any think-tank, for example, that lost its non-profit status would almost certainly go out of business. Similarly, the government could make use of the existing Foreign Agents Registration Act, which gives prosecutors broad discretion to criminalise any sort of foreign support of or even foreign contact with NGOs and think-tanks. Meanwhile, new, more ideologically compliant think-tanks would find the regulatory landscape far easier to navigate.A new Trump administration might further emulate Hungary by starting up its own compliant branches of the media and civil society. Through the strategic use of government contracts and advertising budgets, and by enlisting friendly businessmen to buy up struggling media outlets, the US government could easily tilt the media playing field. Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter (now X) is a model in this regard. Trump certainly has plenty of other billionaire friends who might be willing to play similar roles if he retook the presidency.A new Trump administration may use a trying moment to declare a state of emergency in a similar manner as Orban did in response to the covid-19 crisis. Georgetown law professor David Cole has documented, in the context of the war on terror in the early 2000s, how states of emergency have often been used throughout American history to permanently increase the power of the government.Trump is already aware of the possibilities. During the Black Lives Matter protest in 2020, many in his administration advocated invoking the Insurrection Act, which would have allowed the president to deploy the US military to disperse protesters and restore order. Other administration officials, particularly in the military itself, opposed that suggestion because they disliked the idea of the military getting involved in domestic political disputes. In the end, they managed to get Trump to pull back from using the Insurrection Act, although the military's top office, General Milley, did make an appearance in Lafayette Square as the police cleared the protesters. But the incident demonstrated that there are few institutional restraints on the president claiming such authority in a crisis situation, including a crisis of his own making.A similar scenario could play out in a second Trump term if mass protests erupted in US cities, perhaps in response to some of the other measures described above to consolidate presidential authority. In an administration with more compliant and loyal personnel, it is hard to imagine voices raising in opposition to using the Insurrection Act to rid the administration of troublesome protesters. However, once the state of emergency is declared and the military is on the streets, the executive will fear that ending the emergency and return the military to barracks will simply occasion more protests and greater unrest. The result is that the emergency extends indefinitely, as it has for the last several years in Hungary.\"I have an Article II, where I have the right to do whatever I want as president.\" - Donald Trump, speech to Turning Point USA, 23 July 2019.Trump has had an expansive view of the presidency at least since 2019. That view grafts easily onto the idea of the unitary executive that has been kicking around the Republican Party for decades. During his term in office, however, Trump and his inner circle often felt stymied by what they saw as disloyal political appointees and an intransigent civil service imbued with partisan bias.In the intervening four years, Trump and various former Trump administration officials have proposed a \"war on the administrative state\" as well as various efforts, documented above, to combat this problem and to clear the obstacles to an all-powerful executive. In this effort, the Hungarian experience, despite the very different context, has been instructive. Republican circles have formed strong ties to the Hungarian government and to pro-regime Hungarian intellectuals. They have imparted many important lessons from their experience in creating an electoral autocracy, particularly through demonstrating ways to capture the administrative state and use its power to strengthen the government.None of these developments augurs well for the health of democracy in America if Trump is re-elected. But from a European perspective, the more immediate question is what effect the Orbanisation of America would have on US foreign policy, particularly towards Europe.The first implication is that a Trump administration that had successfully installed loyal political appointees, tamed the administrative state, and rendered Congress nearly powerless would face very few internal constraints on its foreign policy actions. In other words, the adults will have left the room and the guardrails will be gone. Moreover, the US, unlike Hungary, also faces few external constraints. The US government will not fear that Brussels will withhold cohesion funds or initiate infringement or rule of law conditionality procedures against it, as the Hungarian government must.But this situation does beg the question of what a re-elected President Trump would do with that new freedom in foreign policy. Beyond his implementation difficulties, Trump lacked consistency in foreign policy as president. He often got distracted by shiny objects and enchanted by whatever the last adviser or Fox New commentator told him. For example, one day he would fail to retaliate for an Iranian attack on the most important energy infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, and the next he would approve the assassination of the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.Nonetheless, there are some issues on which Trump has had a consistent approach dating back many years, principally when it comes to the holy trinity of trade, immigration, and alliances. Trump has demonstrated a consistent antipathy to every member of the trinity for decades. We should imagine that a Trump-led electoral autocracy will succeed in implementing massive across-the-board tariffs, severely restrict immigration, and reduce the US commitment to allies and alliances.On trade, Europeans should thus take seriously the Trump campaign's announced intention to implement a 20 per cent tariff nearly across the board. More speculatively, Trump's antipathy towards climate policy and his apparent fondness for the traditional energy industry raises the possibility of a fossil fuel-based version of the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act, offering subsidies for US energy production to encourage industrial advantage. Such a policy could create substantial de-industrialisation in Europe.Trump's dislike of standing alliances may not necessarily result in the US pulling out of NATO, but it will certainly undermine the confidence among both rivals and friends on the US commitment to defending its NATO allies in times of crisis. But that is the only purpose of the NATO alliance so, at that point, the United States' formal membership of NATO might become a technicalityOne reason that Trump does not like permanent alliances is that he seems to feel that they restrict US freedom to manoeuvre and negotiate more advantageous deals with a wider variety of partners. This aversion to constraints has parallels with Orban's foreign policy. His government has sought to extend Hungary's ties beyond, and often at the detriment of, its EU and NATO membership. This began with the idea of an \"eastern opening\" toward China and Russia, and has expanded more recently to the broader concept of \"connectivity\" that critiques the emergence of blocs in the world.During his first term, Trump reflected this promiscuous approach to alliances in his outreach to North Korea and his frequent willingness to talk nice to dictators around the world. If re-elected, a less constrained Trump is likely to exercise his predilection to make transactional deals with strongmen rather than engage in the long, bureaucratic process of alliance decision-making. This implies that he will, for example, seek a deal with Vladimir Putin over Ukraine and perhaps even a deal with Xi Jinping over Taiwan.Trump's penchant for forging discrete deals with individual partners may have an even more profound effect in Europe. The strong ties that the Trumpian ecosystem has built up with Hungary and, to a lesser extent, other European populist forces in Austria, Italy, Poland, Slovakia and elsewhere could easily shape internal EU politics. A new Trump administration might be willing to back them in their intra-EU struggles or help out in their individual challenges. In exchange, these forces could use their influence in the Council to, say, reduce retaliation from the EU against his trade policies or for increasing fossil fuel and weapons purchases from the US.European populist leaders with a champion in the White House will feel vindicated and have vastly more leverage in their dealings with Brussels and the more traditional leaders of the EU. The central US role in European security, coupled with Trump's demonstrated willingness to instrumentalise it, means that the EU could face enormous costs for defying the US president.And, of course, European populist leaders have a long list of problems with the EU on which they would like the help of the president of the US. They might like to slow down the EU's fossil fuel phase-out, block the implementation of the European Asylum and Migration Pact adopted in April 2024, or avoid the financial penalties for violating the pact. They also want stricter EU enforcement of border controls and to drastically reduce the cap for new asylum seekers.Much of this is speculative, of course - not least because Trump may well fail in his re-election bid. But a few points shine through this haze of what-ifs. Hungary has provided a roadmap to electoral autocracy. Republicans in the US have indeed learned from it and adapted it to the US context. Despite America's much longer democratic history and more established institutions, a second Trump administration has the necessary ideas and levers to substantially \"Orbanise\" America over another four-year term. They know how to create a nearly all-powerful presidency that could overwhelm Congress, dominate the media and civil society, and substantially intimidate the judiciary. These developments would obviously have negative effects domestically. But, given the central place of the US in European security and economic affairs, they might be equally damaging to European governance and the future of the EU as a democratic project.About the authorsSource: This article was published by The European Council on Foreign Relations, which does not take collective positions.

    "content": "One of the hot topics of the 2024 presidential election is the use of what Republicans have called \"lawfare\" by the Democrats, using the law -- and especially criminal law -- to go after political opponents by using the system to charge them with questionable crimes. I myself have denounced it here and here.There is no way to justify this use of criminal law except to say that it is a tool by political and economic elites to accomplish the same thing as Third World dictators have done, but do so using high-minded terms like \"rule of law\" and \"fairness\" as a cover for the use of naked political power. Furthermore, the elites have accepted it as a legitimate way to further their own power.With all the references to lawfare, one would think it was a relatively new thing; it is not. In fact, Democrat presidents and, to a much lesser extent, Richard Nixon, have used the Internal Revenue Service as their political weapon of choice. The Franklin Roosevelt administration used the IRS to go after former Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon but was unsuccessful in convicting and imprisoning him. However, FDR did discover that the Internal Revenue Service was a handy weapon to wield against people he considered to be his political opponents and went after others like Huey Long.While Democratic presidents like FDR, John F. Kennedy, and Barack Obama have preferred the IRS as a political weapon, Republicans turned to the RICO statutes in the 1980s and terrorism laws after the 9/11 attacks and now find that what they did is blowing back on them. To understand how we got to this present place, we first must know what happened.Forty years ago, in the wake of financial deregulation and the rise of new technologies being commercialized, Wall Street was being transformed. As Murray Rothbard wrote:During the 1960s, the existing corporate power elite, often running their corporations inefficiently -- an elite virtually headed by David Rockefeller -- saw their positions threatened by takeover bids, in which outside financial interests bid for stockholder support against their own inept managerial elites. The exiting corporate elites turned -- as usual -- for aid and bailout from the federal government, which obligingly passed the Williams Act  in 1967. Before the Williams Act, takeover bids could occur quickly and silently, with little hassle. The 1967 Act, however, gravely crippled takeover bids by decreeing that if a financial group amassed more than 5% of the stock of a corporation, it would have to stop, publicly announce its intent to arrange a takeover bid, and then wait for a certain time period before it could proceed on its plans. What Milken did was to resurrect and make flourish the takeover bid concept through the issue of high yield bonds (the \"leveraged buyout\").From the New Deal until the late 1970s, the US financial system was a government-organized cartel that was extremely risk-averse and favored the existing corporate elites over the newly-emerging high-technology firms. However, Michael Milken, working with the upstart investment banking firm, Drexel Burnham Lambert, promoted the use of unsecured, high-yield bonds to finance new operations that the cartelized banking system would never have touched.For example, Milken raised funds for Cable News Network (CNN) which, at its founding in 1980, was thought to be a bridge too far for news broadcasting, and the banks and Wall Street were not interested in working with an iconoclastic figure like CNN's founder, Ted Turner. Milken also led the financing of McCaw Cellular which pioneered cellphone technology and later became part of AT&T. Today, we cannot imagine life before cellphones, but had established Wall Street firms had their way, this industry would not have existed at all.It was bad enough that Milken and his investment bank, as well as other Wall Street upstarts, were doing an end run around the established financial system. However, they also spurred a rash of corporate takeovers, which upset a number of people from leftists like John Kenneth Galbraith to establishment banker David Rockefeller and then-businessman Donald Trump. Wrote Rothbard:The new takeover process enraged the Rockefeller-type corporate elite, and enriched both Mr. Milken and his employers, who had the sound business sense to hire Milken on commission, and to keep the commission going despite the wrath of the establishment. In the process Drexel Burnham grew from a small, third-tier investment firm to one of the giants of Wall Street.The establishment was bitter for many reasons. The big banks who were tied in with the existing, inefficient corporate elites, found that the upstart takeover groups could make an end run around the banks by floating high-yield bonds on the open market. The competition also proved inconvenient for firms who issue and trade in blue-chip, but low-yield, bonds; these firms soon persuaded their allies in the establishment media to sneeringly refer to their high-yield competition as \"junk\" bonds, which is equivalent to the makers of Porsches persuading the press to refer to Volvos as \"junk\" cars.Of course, the financial and political elites could not handle this by producing their own competitive financial instruments. After all, the 1980s were the \"Decade of Greed\" produced by Ronald Reagan, who apparently was guilty of unleashing a wave of free markets that was going to destroy the economy, or worse. Instead, a new hero came from the ranks of Republican officialdom -- Rudy Giuliani -- whom Reagan appointed as US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, which includes Manhattan.Giuliani had political ambitions and decided the best way way to get support was to go after Milken and other Wall Street upstarts. For The New York Times and New Yorker crowd, he was fighting greed and capitalism. For the established Wall Street firms, such as Goldman-Sachs, he would be promoting responsible and respectable capitalism.His legal tool of choice was RICO, which was created in 1970 as a way of moving cases against organized crime from state courts and federalizing the charges in an attempt to gain more convictions. However, using RICO to criminalize routine financial transactions was new territory and, while some economists and lawyers raised obvious objections to where such prosecutions might lead, the academic, media, and political establishments treated Giuliani and his staff as financial and legal messiahs.As Daniel Fischel notes in his book, Payback: The Conspiracy to Destroy Michael Milken and His Financial Revolution, Giuliani and his lieutenants scoured the transactions to see if there were any possible regulatory violations that could be criminalized. Since most regulatory violations fell under civil statutes with no criminal penalties, Giuliani made liberal use of the conspiracy laws to pile up dozens of charges from single transactions, making it appear as though Milken and others had committed serious legal violations. In truth, as Giuliani Lieutenant John Carroll bragged to some Rutgers University law students in 1992, prosecutors found \"crimes\" that had never existed before and were engaged in \"criminalizing technical offenses\" by using \"novel\" criminal theories.There were no gatekeepers to hold Giuliani in check until the appeals courts later overturned some of the convictions, but those were pyrrhic victories for the rule of law, since Giuliani's relentless prosecutions had driven firms and targeted individuals into bankruptcy. Milken himself pleaded guilty not because he had committed real crimes but because federal prosecutors were threatening his family. As I wrote in Regulation:In the end, federal prosecutors (after FBI agents went so far as to question Milken's 92-year-old grandfather) employed perhaps their most powerful weapon, using coercive methods to obtain a guilty plea: if Milken would agree to plead to six non-consequential \"crimes,\" then the Department of Justice would lay off his family. Milken agreed, although, as prosecutor Carroll would admit three years later, the actual charges were a product of prosecutorial creativity, not real criminal conduct. In fact, before Giuliani hit the scene, Milken might have paid a relatively small fine at worst.With Giuliani setting the table for lawfare on a massive scale, he also unleashed federal prosecutors to go after others. The federal prison population, which stood at about 20,000 in 1980, increased 10-fold in the next 20 years and federal prosecutors became major players in the drug war.Of course, Giuliani rode his legal hero status into the mayor's mansion in New York City, supported by the Wall Street establishment and the progressive media. The irony is that his expansion of the use of the RICO statutes to target people who were politically unpopular would enable unscrupulous prosecutors to indict him on state RICO charges in Georgia for allegedly interfering with the 2020 presidential election.Without going into details of that case, it is safe to say that Giuliani's criminalization of, at worst, regulatory violations in the 1980s, opened a Pandora's Box for prosecutors. Certainly the vast expansion of the terrorism statutes imposed following the 9/11 attacks would not have been possible without Giuliani's earlier legal rampages, as federal prosecutors were empowered to do whatever they wanted. Riding the wave of hysteria after the attacks, a Republican Congress pushed through the Patriot Act and other laws that made it possible for federal prosecutors to box in the accused, even if their actions were nothing close to terrorism.Or take Trump's Manhattan conviction, for example. Prosecutor Alvin Bragg's case was admittedly based upon \"novel\" legal theory and most legal observers have said it is doubtful that anyone else will be charged with the particular \"crimes\" that the Manhattan jurors claimed to have seen, a replay of what we saw with Giuliani's cases in the 1980s.While Republicans today rightly decry the political lawfare that Democrats have waged against Trump and others, they should not protest too loudly. Four decades ago, Republicans opened the box and now have found that they cannot put back what they unleashed.",

    "content": "Former President Donald Trump has surpassed Vice President Kamala Harris in a latest election poll for the current cycle.What Happened: The Decision Desk HQ/The Hill forecast model now gives Trump a 52% chance of winning the presidency, compared to Harris's 42%, according to a report from The Hill. This is a significant shift from late August when Harris was leading with a 54 to 56% chance, and Trump was trailing with a 44 to 46% chance.The dynamics began to change in early October, with both candidates' chances predicted to be closer to 50%. By October 17, the model predicted an equal likelihood of either candidate winning the upcoming election. Trump took the lead on October 20.This shift aligns with Trump's improved polling averages in Wisconsin and Michigan, two battleground states that previously leaned slightly toward Harris. Trump already held a slim advantage in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina.However, Pennsylvania, one of the seven swing states seen as decisive in the 2024 election, still favors Harris in its polling average. Despite the shifts, the race remains a toss-up, with polling in all seven states within the margin of error.These states are crucial in determining which candidate secures the necessary 270 electoral votes. Currently, neither Trump nor Harris has a clear lead in enough states to secure that number.See Also: Kevin O'Leary Calls for 400% Tariffs On China, But His 'Shark Tank' Co-Star And Friend Mark Cuban Fires Back With Business ConcernsWhy It Matters: The recent shift in the election forecast comes after a period of narrowing leads and tightening races.

    "title": "Judges punishing Jan. 6 rioters say they fear more political violence as Election Day nears",
    "content": "WASHINGTON -- Over the past four years, judges at Washington's federal courthouse have punished hundreds of rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol in an unprecedented assault on the nation's democracy. On the cusp of the next presidential election, some of those judges fear another burst of political violence could be coming.Before recently sentencing a rioter to prison, U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton said he prays Americans accept the outcome of next month's election. But the veteran judge expressed concern that Donald Trump and his allies are spreading the same sort of conspiracy theories that fueled the mob's Jan. 6, 2021, riot.\"That sore loser is saying the same things he said before,\" Walton said earlier this month without mentioning the Republican presidential nominee by name. \"He's riling up the troops again, so if he doesn't get what he wants, it's not inconceivable that we will experience that same situation again. And who knows? It could be worse.\"Walton, a nominee of President George W. Bush, is not alone. Other judges have said the political climate is ripe for another attack like the one injured more than 100 police officers at the Capitol. As Election Day nears, judges are frequently stressing the need to send a message beyond their courtrooms that political violence can't be tolerated.\"It scares me to think about what will happen if anyone on either side is not happy with the results of the election,\" Judge Jia Cobb, a nominee of President Joe Biden, said during a sentencing hearing last month for four Capitol rioters.Judge Rudolph Contreras lamented the potential for more politically motivated violence as he sentenced a Colorado man, Jeffrey Sabol, who helped other rioters drag a police officer into the mob. Sabol later told FBI agents that a \"call to battle was announced\" and that he had \"answered the call because he was a patriot warrior.\"\"It doesn't take much imagination to imagine a similar call coming out in the coming months, and the court would be concerned that Mr. Sabol would answer that call in the same way,\" Contreras, a President Barack Obama nominee, said in March before sentencing Sabol to more than five years in prison.Trump's distortion of the Jan. 6 attack has been a cornerstone of his bid to reclaim the White House. The former president has denied any responsibility for the crimes of supporters who smashed windows, assaulted police officers and sent lawmakers running into hiding as they met to certify President Joe Biden's 2020 victory.Trump has vowed to pardon rioters, whom he calls \"patriots\" and \"hostages,\" if he wins in November. And he said he would accept the results of the upcoming election only if it's \"free and fair,\" casting doubts reminiscent of his baseless claims in 2020.Judges have repeatedly used their platform on the bench to denounce those efforts to downplay the violence on Jan. 6 and cast the rioters as political prisoners. And some have raised concerns about what such rhetoric means for the future of the country and its democracy.\"We're in a real difficult time in our country, and I hope we can survive it,\" Walton said this month while sentencing a Tennessee nurse who used a pair of medical scissors to smash a glass door at the Capitol.\"I've got a young daughter, I've got a young grandson, and I would like for America to be available to them and be as good to them as it has been to me,\" he added. \"But I don't know if we survive with the mentality that took place that day.\"More than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes related to Jan. 6 siege, which disrupted the peaceful transfer of presidential power for the first time in the nation's history. Over 1,000 rioters have been convicted and sentenced. Roughly 650 of them received prison time ranging from a few days to 22 years.Justice Department prosecutors have argued in many cases that a prison sentence is necessary to deter convicted Capitol rioters from engaging in more politically motivated violence.\"With the 2024 presidential election approaching and many loud voices in the media and online continuing to sow discord and distrust, the potential for a repeat of January 6 looms ominously,\" prosecutors have repeatedly warned in court filings.Prosecutors argue that defendants who have shown little or no remorse for their actions on Jan. 6 could break the law again. Some rioters even seem to be proud of their crimes.The first rioter to enter the Capitol texted his mother, \"I'll go again given the opportunity.\" A man from Washington state who stormed the Capitol with fellow Proud Boys extremist group members told a judge, \"You can give me 100 years and I'd do it all over again.\" A Kentucky nurse who joined the riot told a television interviewer that she would \"do it again tomorrow.\"A Colorado woman known to her social media followers as the \"J6 praying grandma\" avoided a prison sentence in August when a magistrate judge sentenced her for disorderly conduct and trespassing on Capitol grounds. Rebecca Lavrenz told the judge that God, not Trump, led her to Washington on Jan. 6.\"And she has all but promised to do it all over again,\" said prosecutor Terence Parker.Prosecutors had sought 10 months behind bars. After her April trial conviction, Lavrenz went on a \"media blitz\" to defend the mob, spread misinformation, undermine confidence in the courts and boost her celebrity in a community that believes Jan. 6 \"was a good day for this country,\" Parker said.Magistrate Zia Faruqui sentenced Lavrenz to six months of home confinement and fined her $103,000, stressing the need to \"lower the volume\" before the next election.\"These outside influences, the people that are tearing our country apart, they're not going to help you,\" Faruqui told her.",

As reported by the media, poverty rates have nearly doubled to 23.4% of the population in 2024. A family of four needs an income of Rs. 100,000 per month to meet a minimum nutritional intake of 2030 kcal per day. These 20% will have the capacity to change the direction of the people's mandate to govern.Right Diagnosis of the compelling causes is half of the solutionThe practice of politicians levelling various allegations against each other dominates election campaigns everywhere in the world. Most of the elections are now won by disseminating misinformation effectively through social media. Frustrated, marginalised and vulnerable groups' expectations remain at a very high level. Hence those who are keen to stabilise the economy need to address the issues with practical solutions.Thus, whoever gets a mandate to form the next government needs to identify the structural problems that hinder the strengthening of the producers and the consumers who are the important pillars in the real economy which drives growth.",

As reported by the media, poverty rates have nearly doubled to 23.4% of the population in 2024. A family of four needs an income of Rs. 100,000 per month to meet a minimum nutritional intake of 2030 kcal per day. These 20% will have the capacity to change the direction of the people's mandate to govern.Right Diagnosis of the compelling causes is half of the solutionThe practice of politicians levelling various allegations against each other dominates election campaigns everywhere in the world. Most of the elections are now won by disseminating misinformation effectively through social media. Frustrated, marginalised and vulnerable groups' expectations remain at a very high level. Hence those who are keen to stabilise the economy need to address the issues with practical solutions.Thus, whoever gets a mandate to form the next government needs to identify the structural problems that hinder the strengthening of the producers and the consumers who are the important pillars in the real economy which drives growth.",

    "title": "Changing Sentiments in Moscow Towards Trump Ahead of 2024 Election - The Global Herald",
    "content": "The political landscape between Russia and the United States is in a state of flux, particularly regarding the upcoming 2024 presidential election. Unlike the exuberance of 2016 during Donald Trump's election, current attitudes in Moscow appear more reserved and cautious. This shift reflects a growing ambiguity about the implications of another Trump presidency.In November 2016, following Trump's unexpected electoral victory, Russian officials were optimistic about a significant turn in US-Russian relations. Politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky, for instance, famously celebrated by purchasing 132 bottles of champagne, envisioning a new era for diplomacy between the two nations. Margarita Simonyan, the editor-in-chief of the state-funded media outlet RT, expressed her elation with plans to drive through Moscow waving an American flag.These sentiments were accompanied by numerous celebrations, including anecdotes of Russian officials toasting Trump's victory with cigars and champagne -- notable at a time when hopes for lifting sanctions and recognizing Crimea as Russian territory surged in Moscow.However, the initial optimism quickly diminished. Many in Russia felt let down as Trump's administration imposed stringent sanctions, creating a stark contrast to the earlier expectations. \"Trump introduced the heaviest sanctions against Russia at that time,\" explained Konstantin Remchukov, the editor-in-chief of Nezavisimaya Gazeta, highlighting the dashed hopes many had as Trump's presidency unfolded.By the end of his term, mixed feelings prevailed within the Russian political sphere, where disappointment was palpable among those who once viewed Trump as a favorable ally.Fast forward to the current political climate, and Russian officials are reflecting a notably cautious stance regarding Trump's potential return to office. While some leaders have publicly acknowledged the gravity of the matter with humor -- Vladimir Putin even jokingly praised Democratic candidate Kamala Harris for her laugh -- others remain skeptical of whether Trump could deliver on promises that many in Moscow find unrealistic.Moscow's current apprehension contrasts sharply with earlier enthusiasm. As Trump criticizes extensive U.S. military aid to Ukraine, there are suggestions that his rhetoric aligns more closely with Russian interests than that of Harris, who has openly labeled Putin a \"murderous dictator.\" Russian state media has offered less favorable coverage of Harris, indicating a clear preference for Trump's less confrontational approach.Another potential outcome that might intrigue the Kremlin is the possibility of a tightly contested election. Such a situation could result in chaos in the U.S., diverting attention away from foreign relations, including Russia's ongoing conflict in Ukraine. With U.S.-Russian relations deteriorating under the Biden administration, many in Moscow are contemplating how a Trump presidency might alter the discord.The historical context of U.S.-Russia relations illustrates a complicated trajectory. Past leaders, such as Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, worked towards mutual disarmament, showcasing a time when cooperation was a primary goal. Today, however, the relationship is flawed and fraught with challenges, indicating a shift from partnership to rivalry.As the race for the White House continues, the sentiments from Moscow signal a notable shift from exuberant hope to cautious consideration regarding diplomatic relations with the U.S. These changing attitudes will undoubtedly influence how Russian leaders prepare for the outcome of a potential Trump presidency, reflecting a new chapter in this enduring geopolitical narrative.",

Trump frequently attends professional sporting events, including the Alabama-Georgia game on Sept. 28.And judging by the merchandise that's being handed out ahead of the game, it's safe to assume that Trump will receive plenty of cheers from Steelers Nation.

Pennsylvania is considered one of the key \"swing states\" for this year's election, which Trump narrowly won in 2016 before losing it to Joe Biden in 2020.Trump is running against Vice President Kamala Harris, who won the nomination easily after Joe Biden announced that he wouldn't seek re-election.

    "title": "The Most Accurate Pollster in 2020 Has Blockbuster Polls for Trump",
    "content": "Let's discuss some new polls, pollster accuracy, polling bias, the economy, and a reader question on Nate Silver.Silver Bulletin Comments on Three New Trump-Favorable PollsFormer President Trump is ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential contest 50%-48%, according to a new Fox News national survey. That's a reversal from last month, when Harris had a narrow advantage.Harris, however, is ahead by 6 points among voters from the seven key battleground states (within the margin of error for that subsample), and the candidates are tied at 49% each among voters in close counties (where the Biden-Trump 2020 margin was less than 10 points). Trump's advantage comes from a larger share in counties he won by more than 10 points in 2020 (64%-35%) than Harris has in counties Biden won by more than 10 points (58%-39%).That raises the question of whether the Democrat could win the Electoral College while losing the national popular vote. In 2000 and 2016, it was the GOP candidate who lost the popular vote but won the Electoral College.That's certainly an interesting, if not outright shocking set of polls that has Trump ahead nationally but trailing in battlegrounds. Seriously?!In the third of three high-quality polls, TIPP Insights reports Trump Surges Past Harris, Seizing 2-Point LeadPowerful Momentum Shift Reverses the RaceFormer President Donald Trump overtakes Vice President Kamala Harris and now enjoys a two-point lead, 49% to 47%, in the TIPP tracking poll. The data from the seventh release of the 23-day TIPP tracking poll shows the underlying change in the momentum. Recognized by The Washington Post in 2020 as the most accurate national presidential poll, TIPP continues to bring you the latest insights on the race.The WaPo report did not include an evaluation of AtlasIntel. People are still debating what went wrong in 2020.Finally, here's how the most prolific pollsters fared in the general election. The best-performing pollster was AtlasIntel! Second was Trafalgar!Yeah, they incorrectly had Trump winning a few states, but they were close on the margins, and that's the better metric.Note: I no longer embed Tweets because X embeds are broken and randomly display on WordPress. This appears to be an X issue, not a WordPress issue.The Hungarian Conservative notes: \"The most accurate pollster nationally in the United States in the last two election cycles has been Atlas Intel. In 2020 the public opinion research firm overestimated Biden by 0.2 points. In 2022 they overestimated the GOP by 0.3 points in the generic Congressional ballot. Impressively, in both cycles, they got the final results within a few tenths of a point.\"AtlasIntel Comments: \"AtlasIntel had the best performance across all pollsters of the 2020 US Presidential Election with an average error of 2.01p.p. Our final national-level poll showing Biden with a 4.7 p.p. advantage is likely to be the single most precise estimate of the US popular vote. AtlasIntel also conducted the most precise polls across all pollsters for the states of Michigan and North Carolina. In all states polled by AtlasIntel, results fell within the margin of error of our estimates. The AtlasIntel average error was not only lower than that of other pollsters, but also lower than that of polling averages and model-based polling aggregators.\"Reader CommentsAccuracy in 2020 does not imply accuracy in 2022 but it does explain why many of my readers distrust Nate Silver, then 538 and now the Silver Bulletin.One reader asked \"Why do you keep referring to Nate Silver?\"The key reason I refer to Silver is that he explains in detail what he is doing and why. Everyone is free to make their own adjustments and I do.Silver has Trafalgar with a 2.7 percent Republican bias. What if Trafalgar is correct?It makers sense to me to rate pollster bias and weight polls by sample size.However there is certainly a question as to whether Silver has Pollster Bias all wrong.Might I suggest accuracy is the best way to determine if a pollster is \"biased\"? After all Trafalgar was the second most accurate in 2020.Note the influence Silver gave AtlasIntel. This makes sense to me. The reason, or at least one of them, is sample size.One of my readers commented that Silver should not weight the polls but average them. I disagree. In general, the larger the sample, the more accurate the poll.AtlasIntel had a huge sample size of 2,048 likely voters. The NYT/Siena poll only had 857 likely voters.Morning Consult had 1,395 likely voters. Silver rates Morning Consult as having a Democrat bias of 1.2 percentage points. That means to Silver that Trump is ahead in Pennsylvania.Returning to TIPP InsightsA growing sense of economic dissatisfaction looms large. The TIPP Tracking Poll shows that 53% of Americans feel worse off now compared to their situation pre-COVID. Democrats are the most optimistic, with 51% saying they're better off, but 68% of Republicans report being worse off. Independents largely mirror the national mood, with 55% feeling the pain. This dissatisfaction is a headwind for Harris, which Trump could exploit.Growing Economic DissatisfactionDoes \"growing economic dissatisfaction\" sound familiar? It should. It has been my repeated theme since February, weighted to renters (young voters and blacks).Nate Silver Seriously LagsOn October 12, I asked How Much of a Political Lagging Indicator is Nate Silver?On October 18, I commented Trump's Polling Momentum Is Real With Under Three Weeks to GoLet's discuss momentum. Nate Silver mostly dismisses it, but I don't. And the election is in 17 days.Silver had momentum totally wrong. Momentum was there, and obvious. He chose not to see it.Why the Momentum Now?For 67 percent of the nation (the asset holders and the home owners), the economy (the stock market) has been good to very good, offsetting inflation.For the renters and struggling homeowners fed up with property insurance, food, and other inflation, the economy borders on miserable.Who is that? Young voters, blacks, and those without a college education.That is what I said in my post on momentum. The undecided voters are breaking as I suggested in February.Renters (Young Voters and Blacks) Will Decide the ElectionI made that comment in February.I repeated that message in April with People Who Rent Will Decide the 2024 Presidential ElectionI repeated the message a second time on June 19 in Why Angry Renters Will Decide the Election, Take IIEconomists say wages are now rising faster than the CPI. That's not true for those who rent or wish to buy a house.Trump fell way behind after a disastrous debate with Harris. That momentum ended a month ago.People are again asking \"Am I better off than 4 years ago?\"If you own stocks or refinanced your house at 3.0 percent, you likely are better off. And that's a big majority. But that's not who will decide the election. And it is a big part of why Harris is struggling.Trump, not Harris is the candidate of change.The economy is not as good as economists claim. People are suffering, especially Black and young voters, and those traditional Democrat votes are breaking hard for Trump.That is what the Fox News, TIPP Insights, and AtlasIntel polls all suggest. And it's what I have been saying all year.",

    "content": "Kamala Harris celebrated her 60th birthday with visits to churches in Atlanta, Georgia, aiming to mobilize early voters. Meanwhile, her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, took a humorous jab at her by working at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania. This event highlights the intense political climate as the 2024 presidential election approaches.On September 9, 2024, Kamala Harris marked her milestone birthday with a series of events designed to engage voters. She visited two churches in Georgia, where she aimed to galvanize support for early voting ahead of the crucial November 5 election.Harris's birthday celebrations included appearances by notable figures, such as the legendary musician Stevie Wonder, who performed at one of the churches. This star-studded event was part of her broader strategy to connect with voters and encourage them to exercise their electoral rights.In a contrasting move, Donald Trump, the former president and Republican candidate, announced he would take on a role as a fry cook at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania. This light-hearted stunt was intended to mock Harris, who has previously claimed to have worked at a McDonald's in her youth. Trump's campaign advisor, Jason Miller, confirmed that the former president would be working in the fry station, adding a humorous twist to the political rivalry.As the election date draws near, both candidates have ramped up their attacks against each other. Harris and Trump are neck-and-neck in key battleground states, making every campaign event crucial. With only 16 days left until the election, both candidates are leveraging their platforms to mobilize voters through various means, including email outreach and in-person events.Harris's campaign is particularly focused on the \"Souls to the Polls\" initiative, which aims to engage religious leaders and gospel choirs to encourage voter turnout. This initiative reflects her commitment to ensuring that her supporters are well-prepared for the upcoming election.The juxtaposition of Kamala Harris's birthday celebrations with Donald Trump's playful McDonald's job underscores the unique dynamics of the 2024 presidential race. As both candidates work to solidify their bases and attract undecided voters, the coming weeks will be pivotal in determining the outcome of this closely contested election.",

    "title": "Hulk Hogan, Political Analyst: Hulkster Predicts Presidential Election Results",
    "content": "The opinions expressed by contributors are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of RedState.com.I didn't realize that Hulk Hogan had launched into a second career as a political prognosticator, but we can suppose his estimations are as good as anyone else's at this point - although you'll forgive me if I place more stock in someone like, say, Dr. Victor Davis Hanson. But The Hulkster has his opinion as to how the 2024 presidential election is going to end up, and he's predicting a Trump landslide.The wrestling icon made a major splash when he spoke at the Republican National Convention, in which he endorsed the former president to \"let Trumpamania run again.\" Since then, Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, has been traveling across the country to promote his new beer brand, and has discovered through his travels that \"everybody's for Trump.\"\"So I hear what you're saying about the polls, and it's even-Steven, and it might be a close call, but let me tell you something, I don't believe the polls,\" Hogan said on Fox News's One Nation with Brian Kilmeade. \"It's going to be a landslide. Too big to rig, brother, is the theme here, and at the end of the day, all of America wants to get back to America. Not the way it used to be, but the way it should be, brother.\"Well, there's just one thing wrong with that argument: not all of America wants to \"get back\" to America. The wealthy coastal elites, the ivory-tower academics, the government employees unions, the dependency classes - they would prefer not to go back to an America that was a paragon of individual liberty and personal achievement. But I think Hogan has a point; plenty of us would like to \"get back to America,\" even if it's just an America of four years ago.I wouldn't mind $2 for a gallon of gasoline again, either.Hogan also addressed Trump's appearance at the Al Smith dinner, which he praised for Trump's various jokes, including one aimed at \"white dudes for Harris.\" In addition to Trump's comedic ability, Hogan also spoke highly of Trump's business experience, and claimed \"that's what this country needs.\"\"We want God in our homes, and in our schools, and in our country,\" Hogan said. \"We basically want safety, we want, basically, to have great lives, and we want to be able to economically afford to live a good life and take care of our children. Trump is all about that. Everything I hear on the other side is supposed to be hope and happy, it all sounds like doom and gloom to me.\"Personally, I want to be left alone to live my life as I see fit. But I think there's room for that in the America the Hulkster is describing. And it's looking more and more all the time that whatever America we end up with, it will have, for the next four years, Donald Trump seated at the Resolute Desk. And who knows, if things go well, we'll have a President Vance after that - and maybe a President DeSantis later on. OK, I may be leaning a little too far forward in the foxhole here, but the world's got no shortage of windmills to tilt at.Hogan doesn't describe precisely how he defines \"landslide.\" I think a Trump win with over 300 Electoral College votes is very plausible, and that's probably in \"mandate\" territory, depending on how Congress shakes out, but I wouldn't call it a \"landslide.\"See Related: Happy Birthday, Kamala. Have You Checked the Polls?CLEAN SWEEP: Trump Claims All the Battleground States for the 1st Time in RCP AverageNational Treasure, Dr. Victor Davis Hanson, Weighs In on Who Will Win the White HouseSetting aside his prognosticating, though, I think that for all his theatrics, Hulk Hogan may be on to something here. For quite a while now, as noted above, the Democrats have been a party representing a few loud, obnoxious special interests, and plenty of regular folks are tired of it. I know I am. We're tired of being lectured over our \"carbon footprints.\" We gray-haired old white dudes are tired of hearing how we're racist, sexist homophobes. Young white dudes are tired of it, too, and they are breaking towards conservatism at an ever-increasing pace. We're tired of being called \"transphobic\" for not wanting young dudes playing on our daughters' and granddaughters' sports teams - and sharing their locker rooms and showers. We're tired of being called racist for laying legitimate criticisms on liberal politicians who are \"people of color.\"We're just tired of all of it, and we get the feeling that maybe Donald Trump is tired of it, too.Look, plenty of people - like me - just want to go about our daily business, live our lives, earn our livings, and not be bothered. The Democrats seem to want to bother us all the time. That's in no small part why they're losing this election, and maybe Mr. Hogan is right - maybe this thing will be more decisive than it looks.",

    "title": "2024 Election: What's at stake for the queer and trans community - INTO",
    "content": "Before we know it, election day for the November 2024 presidential election will be upon us. We've heard time and again that this is the most important election of our lives, something we might be tired of hearing every four years. There is obviously a lot at stake in this election, from abortion rights to how future elections will be held. But what is at stake specifically for the queer community?Many members of the LGBTQ+ community likely already know who they are going to vote for. In the broadest terms, Donald Trump's campaign has attacked LGBTQ+ rights and Kamala Harris' has made moves in a positive direction. But to fully understand the situation, and to be able to explain it to others who might need reminding what a vote in one direction or another might mean for those they love, it's important to know the full details.We're going to take a look at what each of the two leading presidential candidates have said about LGBTQ+ issues, what they've promised for the future, and what they've actually done. This is all about the top of the ticket. It's important to remember that the down ticket races are also extremely important as they will help to decide the House, the Senate, and the people making policies on the state level from court houses to schools. Ultimately, the presidential candidate will set the tone for the nation, so let's start there.Be informed, be inspired, and be part of the conversation that's shaping a queerer world with our twice-a-week newsletter.When it comes to campaign promises related to LGBTQ+ issues, the Harris is putting all her eggs in one basket. Under the heading of \"Protect Civil Rights and Freedoms,\" Harris promises that, if elected, she will fight to pass the Equality Act, noting that it would \"enshrine anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQI+ Americans in health care, housing, education, and more into law.\"The Equality Act would update past civil rights laws, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, to create explicit protections against discrimination on matters of sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity at a federal level. In addition, it updates what is defined as a \"public space\" to include businesses that might otherwise try to skirt civil rights protections. Passing the Equality Act would fairly immediately create a positive legacy for a Harris presidency, but it's also a big swing. The campaign notably says that she will \"fight to pass the Equality Act.\" Even as president, she would not have the power to pass the act through executive order and would need Congress to sign off on it.While most US citizens seem to support the principles behind the Equality Act, a version of the most recent iteration of the bill was introduced in Congress in 2015 and failed to pass. Since then, it has been reintroduced several times only to die in committee. The most recent version was in 2023 and was referred to the committees of jurisdiction. Then-President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden supported the Equality Act in 2015, and Biden and Harris have both repeatedly pushed for it to be passed since taking office. For Harris to pull off passing the Equality Act as president, she'd also need a Democratic majority in Congress, or else convince a lot of Republicans to support it.The only other mention of LGBTQ+ matters in Harris' campaign platform is in a note about \"Trump's Project 2025 Agenda.\" Laying out some of Donald Trump's plans highlights where she stands in relation to her opponent. Perhaps a stark contrast, but it's a promise of what she won't do, rather than what she will do for LGBTQ+ people in the United States.Harris has been relatively quiet on LGBTQ+ issues during the campaign. However, there is probably good reason for that. Harris is already seen as the safer vote by many LGBTQ+ voters and raising the topics opens the door for more vitriol from opponents and the creation of sound bites for attack ads. That feels disheartening, but in many ways what is more important than what she promises to do is what she has already done in the past and continues to do.While Harris' campaign might be light on LGBTQ+ policy statements, her choice of Tim Walz as her running mate says a lot about her intended direction. Walz has consistently been ahead of the curve on LGBTQ+ issues.Donald Trump's campaign site includes an abbreviated explanation of his platform. Of the 20 points, only two deal with LGBTQ+ issues. Point 16 takes issue with queer identities being taught or discussed in schools: \"Cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, radical gender ideology, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.\" Point 17 uses dog whistle language to attack trans athletes by implying that they are not the gender that they are: \"Keep men out of women's sports.\"The more detailed manifesto, marked as the 2024 GOP Platform, is 15 pages long and elaborates more on these points. Trump promises to \"ban Taxpayer  funding for sex change surgeries,\" which presumably means removing gender-affirming care from Medicare, a policy already enacted in Florida which has done massive damage to trans people in the state. He also vows to \"stop Taxpayer-funded Schools from promoting gender transition,\" something that isn't happening, but rather an idea that Trump has been trying to push despite other Republicans acknowledging that it is untrue. At the 2023 CPAC, Trump also stated he would \"revoke every Biden policy promoting the chemical castration and sexual mutilation of our youth and ask Congress to send me a bill prohibiting child sexual mutilation in all 50 states.\" Trump is presumably alluding to gender-affirming surgeries being performed on minors. A Harvard study found that gender-affirming surgeries were non-existent in young children and rare among teens (and also requiring parental consent). Along with plans to \"reverse Biden's radical rewrite of Title IX Education Regulations,\" what this would actually do is discriminate against trans people, particularly trans youth, and leave them to be misgendered and denied access to basic accommodations and reasonable healthcare.It's hard to talk about Donald Trump's campaign promises without talking about Project 2025. The Democratic campaign has worked hard to align the two. Trump, however, has worked to distance himself from it, claiming that he \"knows nothing\" and had \"no idea\" who is behind it. CNN has listed 140 former Trump advisers who have worked on Project 2025, so it is perhaps hard to believe that Trump was entirely ignorant of its existence, content, and origin (although, if he was, that's perhaps also worrying). Most gender-affirming surgeries in teens were actually found to have been for cis men who wanted chest reductions. Among many of the plans laid out in the 900 page document, Project 2025 takes aim at the progress made in recent years by planning to rescind prohibitions on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, and more (find the full details on page 584).Whether Trump aligns himself with Project 2025 or not, it is worth being aware of the vision it lays out for America. The manifesto was spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that influenced the Reagan administration, opposed the Respect for Marriage Act, has been behind a huge number of the anti-trans bills that have appeared in legislatures across the country in recent years, and is consistently ranked as one of the most influential think tanks in the United States.Trump has been loud on LGBTQ+ issues, particularly on trans topics. As he is a Republican and many of the other politicians in his party have run on anti-trans platforms in recent years, that perhaps isn't surprising. Prior to winning the presidency in 2016, Trump's comments and actions wavered a little with some overtures made to the LGBTQ+ community but became more consistent after attaining office. The best way to understand Trump's views and the actions he can be expected to take if he becomes president after the November 2024 elections is to look at his record in office and on the road.After leaving office in 2021, Trump continued to make comments about the LGBTQ+ community with the focus moving to transgender people. Here are some plans that he has stated at rallies but not listed in his Agenda 47 platform.Donald Trump has made his plans for LGBTQ+ people clear, and his selections for vice-president have reflected that. In 2016, Trump chose the famously anti-LGBTQ+ Mike Pence as his running mate. With Pence not returning to Trump's ticket for the 2024 campaign, Trump had an opportunity to provide balance to his ticket. However, he selected Ohio senator JD Vance, who similarly has an anti-LGBTQ+ pedigree and has been happy to parrot Trump's remarks on the campaign trail after doing a heel turn on previous comments about Trump and formerly identifying himself as a never-Trumper.When it comes to LGBTQ+ rights, freedoms, and protections, the 2024 presidential election offers the opportunity to move forwards or to take some big steps backwards. While our choices are rarely perfect, there is one candidate in this race who is clearly going to help to make the United States safer for queer people. It is also important to remember the down-ballot races when voting in this election. The president might set the tone, but from Congress to school boards anti-LGBTQ+ policies can still be enacted if the wrong people get their hands on power.Election day is November 5, 2024. Early voting has already started. For information on casting your vote visit Vote.org, and check out our guide for voting while trans.",

In response, Sanders argued that Hamas is \"a terrible terrorist organization\" that Israel is entitled to defend itself against, while arguing that Israel does not have a right \"to go to war against the entire Palestinian people.\"\"And I will be leading the effort to make sure that we do not provide more offensive military aid to Israel,\" Sanders said. \"But to those people who say, 'Well, I can't support Harris because she disagrees,' Trump on that issue, even on that issue, is worse. He will be closer to Netanyahu.\"\nIn addition to Pennsylvania, Michigan is another major swing state both Harris and Trump are seeking to win the respective Electoral College votes in this election cycle. During a rally in Michigan on Friday, the former president claimed \"Democrats have been wreaking havoc\" in Detroit, prompting him to promise to give the city \"the real comeback\" it needs.Polling data from RealClearPolitics has indicated that Trump is narrowly leading Harris in Michigan since mid-October, marking the first time since late July that Trump is favored to win the state. Trump was largely beating President Joe Biden in polling before he dropped his reelection bid, with Harris leading the state shortly after she launched her presidential run.",

    "content": "By Ernie Suggs and Greg Bluestein, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution The Tribune Content AgencyNew Birth Missionary Baptist Church was awash in pink Sunday morning, a stark contrast to the reds and blues that have dominatedthe 2024 presidential campaign.It was Pink Sunday to bring attention to breast cancer. But the distinctly feminine shade also seemed a fitting backdrop for the day's guest: Kamala Harris, who, if she is elected next month, would be the nation's first woman president.Locked in a tight battle with Republican Donald Trump, Harris celebrated her 60th birthday Sunday at the Black megachurch in DeKalb County Sunday appealing to faith-based voters, one of Georgia's most important constituencies.The congregation erupted when Pastor Jamal Bryant, welcomed Harris to the pulpit and serenaded the vice president with \"Happy Birthday.\"\"Who knew that 60 years ago today, that you were born to be president?\" Bryant said. \"To save democracy.\"Trump's campaign is also pressing its appeal to evangelical Christians. On Wednesday, Trump is scheduled to be in Zebulon, about 50 miles south of Atlanta,with Lt. Gov. Burt Jones for a \"Believers and Ballots Faith Town Hall.\"On Sunday, he briefly worked the fryer at McDonald's in Pennsylvania. (McDonald's has been thrust into the spotlight this campaign as Trump has claimed, without evidence, that Harris never worked at the fast-food chain, as she has said).'The state that turns this country around'Harris, who does not often talk publicly about her faith, cast the Nov. 5 election as a moment for Americans to choose between hate and compassion, drawing on a message of \"love thy neighbor.\"She told the congregation at New Birth about growing up in church, where she said she first learned of a \"loving God who asks us to speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, and to defend the rights of the poor and the needy.\"\"For me, like for so many of us, church is then a place of growth and belonging and community, a place where we are reminded of the incredible power of faith and fellowship,\" she said. \"And in moments of difficulty and uncertainty when the way is not clear, it is our faith that then guides us forward.\"New Birth was the first stop on Harris's \"souls to the polls\" tour. She also attended Divine Faith Ministries International in Jonesboro.As the 2024 presidential election enters its crucial final weeks, Harris and Trump are ramping up their efforts to appeal to their political bases. Georgia is a key battleground state that could help determine the outcome of election. More than 1 million Georgians have already cast ballots since early voting began Tuesday.\"This is Georgia, and Georgia is gonna be the state that turns this country around,\" said Bishop Donald Battle, the pastor of Divine Faith Ministries International.\"People are trying to take us back, but I am letting you know that God has raised us somebody who is not going to let that happen.\"U.S. Reps. Hank Johnson and Nikema Williams as well as Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens were among the 56 elected officials at New Birth. When Bryant announced that Opal Lee, the 98-year-old Texan known as the \"Mother of Juneteenth,\" was in attendance, Harris sprang from her seat in the front row of the giant church and hugged her.Unlike Saturday's Atlanta rally of 18,000 people, Harris's address at New Birth was more subdued in the religious setting.\"We face this question, what kind of country do we want to live in? A country of chaos, fear and hate, or a country of freedom, compassion and justice?\" she asked.Harris told the congregation that they had the power to answer that question, \"not just through our words, but through our action and with our votes.\"The visit was briefly interrupted when a woman in the pews shouted \"What about the unborn?\" as Bryant spoke, according to CNN. The woman is not Black and this a largely Black church. People appeared incensed and started pointing at her before she was led out of the sanctuary.Sunday's focus on breast cancer also held significance for Harris; her mother was a breast cancer researcher and died of colon cancer in 2009.'Believers for Trump'Republicans are also stepping up ways to reach religious voters. Trump has long maintained strong support among white, evangelical voters, but he'll need surging turnout from them to capture Georgia.His campaign has courted conservative evangelicals for the last decade, and he's sold Trump-themed Bibles and promoted his selection of three U.S. Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade to energize Christians.A September Pew Research Center survey showed Trump capturing roughly 80% of white evangelical voters and 61% of white Catholics. Harris had the most strength among Black protestants, winning 86% of their support, along with about two-thirds of Jewish voters.On Friday, a parade of Republican leaders and evangelical heavyweights took turns on the pulpit of an Austell church bedecked with American flags to sing the former president's praises. The event was dubbed simply \"Believers for Trump.\"Attendees said they've found ways to reconcile Trump's personal history, such as his three marriages and felony conviction on hush money charges, with the conservative record he built during his term in office and his vow to forge a similar agenda if he's elected.Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley, who trekked to Atlanta for the event, said evangelical voters are inexorably drawn to his stances.\"When they look at the issues that they care about, for their families and for their communities, they're going to understand that Donald Trump better represents their values,\" he said in an interview.Scott Turner, a former NFL player who pastors a Texas megachurch, issued a stern challenge to the audience. He said it was a \"duty and responsibility of every Christian, every man and woman of God\" to cast their ballots for \"like-minded\" leaders.One of Harris's most important Georgia surrogates, he warmed up the crowd before Harris arrived for the noon service. Many of the congregants had been waiting since 8 a.m.\"Are you ready to win this election?\" he asked the congregation.When Warnock asked the crowd who have already voted, more than half stood up. Close to 30,000 people have voted in Clayton County since early voting began last week.Harris was greeted at the churchby Stevie Wonder, who was in Atlanta for a concert Saturday night.The music icon led the congregation in a live version of his \"Happy Birthday,\" altering the lyrics from Rev.

He praised Black women for being strong supporters of Harris and encouraged Black men to follow suit.\"If you remain silent at this time, your family won't survive,\" Bryant said. \"This is not the time to be bougie and stuck up. I am gonna challenge you today. After we leave here today, all us are gonna go down to vote.\"Closing out her speech, Harris reminded the congregation of her Black bona fides.\"Weeping may endure for a night,\" said Harris, in an obvious nod to the Black church, which the congregation picked up on as they began to cheer. \"But joy cometh in the morning.\"Before the end of Bryant's sermon, he asked everyone in the congregation to stretch their hands toward Harris.",

    "content": "Donald Trump was in suburban Pennsylvania on Sunday where he attempted to come across as America's \"everyman\" president in a very modern way -- by working at McDonald's.Instead, the former president created a kind of strange spectacle as he stoked fears about election fraud while wearing an apron through the restaurant's drive-thru window. The scene that played out in the Feasterville neighborhood of the Lower Southampton Township, where the former president and his campaign took over a McDonald's franchise restaurant owned by one of his supporters.The roughly hour-long photo opp closed down the restaurant entirely. A sign on the door said that the restaurant would be closed Sunday until 4pm, after the president and his entourage had left. During the visit, Trump had an apron tied behind his back by a McDonald's cashier before he recieved a short demonstration of how to work the fry station and stuck his head through the drive-thru.Trump proceeded to hand out a number of orders through the drive-thru window on Sunday, chatting to supporters who were picking up their meals.As he took a question from a reporter through the drive-thru window, Trump once again resorted to baseless suggestions that the 2024 presidential election results would be tainted by fraud, a charge he and running mate JD Vance have repeated about the past presidential election.\"Will you accept the results of the election?\" asked a reporter.\"Yeah, sure, if it's a fair election,\" the apron-clad Trump declared, his head fully poking out of the drive-thru.Trump and his cronies spent months raising such claims in the aftermath of the 2020 election, but failed to win any of the legal challenges they filed against the final vote counts in the several states where the results were contested. Audits later failed to find any of the widespread fraud Trump claimed existed, and election officials roundly proclaimed the results to be accurate.Still, Trump would go on to repeat those claims for years, and he now looks poised to contest the results of the race again should he lose; whether it be through legal challenges or merely rhetoric.His past efforts to gin up a mob to interfere in the certification of the Electoral College results in 2021 led to Congress passing legislation that reformed how that process is carried out.",

    "title": "What does China want from the next US president?",
    "content": "Chee Meng Tan, Assistant Professor of Business Economics, University of NottinghamDuring a Taiwan National Day speech on October 10, Taiwanese president Lai Ching-te said that Taipei was determined to defend Taiwan's sovereignty against \"annexation and encroachment\", and emphasised that \"China has no right to represent Taiwan\".Though Washington doesn't have diplomatic relations with Taipei officially, it does have regular communication through back channels and a strong economic relationship. The island is a key US trading partner and is a major supplier of semiconductors which are critical to the production of computers and other technologies. It also sells arms to Taiwan, although this has reduced significantly under Joe Biden.China has not ruled out taking Taiwan by force, and if it does, the US might come to the self-ruling island's defence as indicated by Washington in the past.But Xi will be hoping the outcome of the 2024 US presidential election might bring a leader that would have a different attitude to Taiwan as well as helping China resolve its economic storm, which has resulted in a rising number of protests. So, between an outspoken Donald Trump and a seemingly even-tempered Kamala Harris, does Beijing have a favourite? And do either of them offer Xi anything new?\nLike it or not, Xi might have to ramp up whatever agenda Beijing has for Taiwan. If he could make sufficient progress towards unification, he may be hailed as one of the greats of the Chinese Communist Party, which would consolidate his status within the party, and distract from the nation's economic woes.Unlike Harris, who appears to take take alliances and partnerships seriously, Trump questions the benefits of many alliances forged by the US. In fact, the few times that he spoke about Taiwan centres on how the island state has taken America's semiconductor business, and should pay more to the US for its defence.So, would Trump come to Taiwan's aid if China does invade Taiwan? Given the importance of semiconductors to electronics and AI, he just might. But Trump also has a reputation as a \"dealmaker-in-chief\", so he might just cut a deal with Beijing, which erodes Taiwan's independence. And that is likely to worry Taipei.As Russia's \"partner of no limits\", China has been supplying Russia with technology that fuels Russia's war machinery against Ukraine. But this has strained Sino-western relations and earned Beijing trade and import restrictions, which hampers China's economic recovery.A future Trump administration might strengthen Russia by withdrawing support for Ukraine and lifting sanctions against Russia. And a more robust Russia is good news for Beijing.So, at first glance, Trump and Harris's approaches towards China are different. Trump's return to the White House could also intensify the trade war that he started in 2018, as tariffs on Chinese goods could go to as high as 60%. This might hasten the economic decoupling between the US and China.Harris, on the other hand, wishes to \"de-risk\" China. This approach seeks to maintain US global interest while engaging with the east Asian economic behemoth. In such a scenario, Beijing might prefer a Harris presidency as it leaves room for negotiation.How much influence the tech multi-billionaire actually has over Trump is uncertain. However, it's worth noting that Musk has substantial business dealings in China, and might seek to lean on Trump if the former president's policies harms Tesla's interests.With many of these factors unclear at the moment, Beijing will be hoping for a US leader who is more interested in economic wins than protecting Taiwan, and one that Xi can negotiate with to warm up relations between the two countries.",

During a rally in Michigan on Friday, the former president claimed \"Democrats have been wreaking havoc\" in Detroit, prompting him to promise to give the city \"the real comeback\" it needs.Polling data from RealClearPolitics has indicated that Trump is narrowly leading Harris in Michigan since mid-October, marking the first time since late July that Trump is favored to win the state. Trump was largely beating President Joe Biden in polling before he dropped his reelection bid, with Harris leading the state shortly after she launched her presidential run.",

    "content": "This election is still a dead heat, according to most polls. In a fight with such wafer-thin margins, we need reporters on the ground talking to the people Trump and Harris are courting. Your support allows us to keep sending journalists to the story.The Independent is trusted by 27 million Americans from across the entire political spectrum every month. Unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock you out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. But quality journalism must still be paid for.Help us keep bring these critical stories to light. Your support makes all the difference.Donald Trump was in suburban Pennsylvania on Sunday where he attempted to come across as America's \"everyman\" president in a very modern way -- by working at McDonald's.Instead, the former president created a kind of strange spectacle as he stoked fears about election fraud while wearing an apron through the restaurant's drive-thru window. The scene that played out in the Feasterville neighborhood of the Lower Southampton Township, where the former president and his campaign took over a McDonald's franchise restaurant owned by one of his supporters.The roughly hour-long photo opp closed down the restaurant entirely. A sign on the door said that the restaurant would be closed Sunday until 4pm, after the president and his entourage had left. During the visit, Trump had an apron tied behind his back by a McDonald's cashier before he recieved a short demonstration of how to work the fry station and stuck his head through the drive-thru.Trump proceeded to hand out a number of orders through the drive-thru window on Sunday, chatting to supporters who were picking up their meals.As he took a question from a reporter through the drive-thru window, Trump once again resorted to baseless suggestions that the 2024 presidential election results would be tainted by fraud, a charge he and running mate JD Vance have repeated about the past presidential election.\"Will you accept the results of the election?\" asked a reporter.\"Yeah, sure, if it's a fair election,\" the apron-clad Trump declared, his head fully poking out of the drive-thru.Trump and his cronies spent months raising such claims in the aftermath of the 2020 election, but failed to win any of the legal challenges they filed against the final vote counts in the several states where the results were contested. Audits later failed to find any of the widespread fraud Trump claimed existed, and election officials roundly proclaimed the results to be accurate.Still, Trump would go on to repeat those claims for years, and he now looks poised to contest the results of the race again should he lose; whether it be through legal challenges or merely rhetoric.His past efforts to gin up a mob to interfere in the certification of the Electoral College results in 2021 led to Congress passing legislation that reformed how that process is carried out.",

    "title": "Kamala Harris brings her Georgia campaign to church as candidates vie for religious votes",
    "content": "Ernie Suggs and Greg Bluestein - The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (TNS)New Birth Missionary Baptist Church was awash in pink Sunday morning, a stark contrast to the reds and blues that have dominated the 2024 presidential campaign.It was Pink Sunday to bring attention to breast cancer. But the distinctly feminine shade also seemed a fitting backdrop for the day's guest: Kamala Harris, who, if she is elected next month, would be the nation's first woman president.Locked in a tight battle with Republican Donald Trump, Harris celebrated her 60th birthday Sunday at the Black megachurch in DeKalb County Sunday appealing to faith-based voters, one of Georgia's most important constituencies.The congregation erupted when Pastor Jamal Bryant, welcomed Harris to the pulpit and serenaded the vice president with \"Happy Birthday.\"\"Who knew that 60 years ago today, that you were born to be president?\" Bryant said. \"To save democracy.\"Trump's campaign is also pressing its appeal to evangelical Christians. On Wednesday, Trump is scheduled to be in Zebulon, about 50 miles south of Atlanta, with Lt. Gov. Burt Jones for a \"Believers and Ballots Faith Town Hall.\"On Sunday, he briefly worked the fryer at McDonald's in Pennsylvania. (McDonald's has been thrust into the spotlight this campaign as Trump has claimed, without evidence, that Harris never worked at the fast-food chain, as she has said).'The state that turns this country around'Harris, who does not often talk publicly about her faith, cast the Nov. 5 election as a moment for Americans to choose between hate and compassion, drawing on a message of \"love thy neighbor.\"She told the congregation at New Birth about growing up in church, where she said she first learned of a \"loving God who asks us to speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, and to defend the rights of the poor and the needy.\"\"For me, like for so many of us, church is then a place of growth and belonging and community, a place where we are reminded of the incredible power of faith and fellowship,\" she said. \"And in moments of difficulty and uncertainty when the way is not clear, it is our faith that then guides us forward.\"New Birth was the first stop on Harris's \"souls to the polls\" tour. She also attended Divine Faith Ministries International in Jonesboro.As the 2024 presidential election enters its crucial final weeks, Harris and Trump are ramping up their efforts to appeal to their political bases. Georgia is a key battleground state that could help determine the outcome of election. More than 1 million Georgians have already cast ballots since early voting began Tuesday.\"This is Georgia, and Georgia is gonna be the state that turns this country around,\" said Bishop Donald Battle, the pastor of Divine Faith Ministries International.\"People are trying to take us back, but I am letting you know that God has raised us somebody who is not going to let that happen.\"U.S. Reps. Hank Johnson and Nikema Williams as well as Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens were among the 56 elected officials at New Birth. When Bryant announced that Opal Lee, the 98-year-old Texan known as the \"Mother of Juneteenth,\" was in attendance, Harris sprang from her seat in the front row of the giant church and hugged her.Unlike Saturday's Atlanta rally of 18,000 people, Harris's address at New Birth was more subdued in the religious setting.\"We face this question, what kind of country do we want to live in? A country of chaos, fear and hate, or a country of freedom, compassion and justice?\" she asked.Harris told the congregation that they had the power to answer that question, \"not just through our words, but through our action and with our votes.\"The visit was briefly interrupted when a woman in the pews shouted \"What about the unborn?\" as Bryant spoke, according to CNN. The woman is not Black and this a largely Black church. People appeared incensed and started pointing at her before she was led out of the sanctuary.Sunday's focus on breast cancer also held significance for Harris; her mother was a breast cancer researcher and died of colon cancer in 2009.'Believers for Trump'Republicans are also stepping up ways to reach religious voters. Trump has long maintained strong support among white, evangelical voters, but he'll need surging turnout from them to capture Georgia.His campaign has courted conservative evangelicals for the last decade, and he's sold Trump-themed Bibles and promoted his selection of three U.S. Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade to energize Christians.A September Pew Research Center survey showed Trump capturing roughly 80% of white evangelical voters and 61% of white Catholics. Harris had the most strength among Black protestants, winning 86% of their support, along with about two-thirds of Jewish voters.On Friday, a parade of Republican leaders and evangelical heavyweights took turns on the pulpit of an Austell church bedecked with American flags to sing the former president's praises. The event was dubbed simply \"Believers for Trump.\"Attendees said they've found ways to reconcile Trump's personal history, such as his three marriages and felony conviction on hush money charges, with the conservative record he built during his term in office and his vow to forge a similar agenda if he's elected.Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley, who trekked to Atlanta for the event, said evangelical voters are inexorably drawn to his stances.\"When they look at the issues that they care about, for their families and for their communities, they're going to understand that Donald Trump better represents their values,\" he said in an interview.Scott Turner, a former NFL player who pastors a Texas megachurch, issued a stern challenge to the audience. He said it was a \"duty and responsibility of every Christian, every man and woman of God\" to cast their ballots for \"like-minded\" leaders.'Ready to win this election?'At Divine Faith Ministries International in Jonesboro, U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock wasn't convinced.One of Harris's most important Georgia surrogates, he warmed up the crowd before Harris arrived for the noon service. Many of the congregants had been waiting since 8 a.m.\"Are you ready to win this election?\" he asked the congregation.When Warnock asked the crowd who have already voted, more than half stood up. Close to 30,000 people have voted in Clayton County since early voting began last week.Harris was greeted at the church by Stevie Wonder, who was in Atlanta for a concert Saturday night.The music icon led the congregation in a live version of his \"Happy Birthday,\" altering the lyrics from Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to honor Harris.\"Think about more than yourself when you vote. Think about how they want to erase history. The ugly and painful truth,\" Wonder said.He followed up with Bob Marley's \"Redemption Song\" and wrapped up with a verse of \"Higher Ground,\" while the crowd chanted, \"Kamala.\"\"We need a landslide to unite the country and unite the world,\" Wonder told the congregation. \"So handle your business.\"Earlier at New Birth, Bryant reminded people as they cheered for Harris to remember to do more -- vote. He praised Black women for being strong supporters of Harris and encouraged Black men to follow suit.\"If you remain silent at this time, your family won't survive,\" Bryant said. \"This is not the time to be bougie and stuck up. I am gonna challenge you today. After we leave here today, all us are gonna go down to vote.\"Closing out her speech, Harris reminded the congregation of her Black bona fides.\"Weeping may endure for a night,\" said Harris, in an obvious nod to the Black church, which the congregation picked up on as they began to cheer. \"But joy cometh in the morning.\"Before the end of Bryant's sermon, he asked everyone in the congregation to stretch their hands toward Harris.He then prayed for her protection.©2024 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

    "content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) did not provide a direct answer when asked if Pennsylvania Democrats are hurting Vice President Kamala Harris's electability in the state.Sanders was asked about a new ad from Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) that shows the Pennsylvania Democrat boasting about how he \"bucked Biden to protect fracking\" and sided with Trump over placing tariffs on China \"to stop them from cheating.\" The release of the ad comes as former President Donald Trump seeks the White House again and Casey is seeking reelection against Republican challenger Dave McCormick in the 2024 elections.\"Well, what I think is that at a time when we have more income and wealth inequality in this country than we've ever had, when we have a healthcare system, which allows us to be the only major country on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people, when we have a $7.25 minimum wage, when you got so many senior citizens need to see an increase in their Social Security, I personally think that the winning issues are taking on corporate greed Bob Casey is talking about,\" Sanders said on CNN's State of the Union. \"And fighting for the working class against the people on top, who have never, ever had it so good. That would be my suggestion.\"CNN's Jake Tapper then asked Sanders about the about-face that Harris has made on various topics ahead of the election, including no longer wanting to ban fracking and no longer supporting the Green New Deal. Sanders contended that Harris's reversal is part of \"a coalition of people\" working together to achieve a common goal, that being defeating the \"very dangerous candidate\" of Trump in the 2024 presidential election.Sanders was then asked about any concern the Democratic Party has over Harris's support from Arab-Americans in Michigan, specifically if President Joe Biden's support for Israel amid its conflict with the Hamas terrorist group could deter support from this voting bloc in the swing state. In response, Sanders argued that Hamas is \"a terrible terrorist organization\" that Israel is entitled to defend itself against, while arguing that Israel does not have a right \"to go to war against the entire Palestinian people.\"\"And I will be leading the effort to make sure that we do not provide more offensive military aid to Israel,\" Sanders said. \"But to those people who say, 'Well, I can't support Harris because she disagrees,' Trump on that issue, even on that issue, is worse.

    "title": "The Other Giant Election Indicator In Plain Sight That Nobody Speaks Of",
    "content": "You keep hearing phrases like \"coin toss\" and \"dead heat\" (48% to 48% if you're interested) to describe the status of the 2024 presidential election. This despite the fact that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are playing to enthusiastic crowds, packed to the rafters, while Donald Trump and J.D. Vance are in smaller venues, with people leaving early. How can that be? It is reminiscent of that famous line from George Orwell's 1984, \"The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.\" Switch out the word \"media\" for \"party.\" We are being told, in essence, that whatever enthusiasm we see for a great Democratic pair, bringing a new generation and a new vision into the political arena is of no account, because people prefer the vulgarian, who is visibly decompensating before our very eyes with each and every rally that he goes to.Just this weekend we heard Trump call Kamala Harris \"A shit vice president,\" and tell Jill Biden, \"Get your fat husband off the couch, slap him around.\" Trump can't control himself anymore. Most dementia patients can't. Yet we are told that this is of no account. And the media doesn't even report Trump's mental deterioration. Last night Trump plunged into a sub-basement a bit too bizarre for even him, when he spoke of the size of Arnold Palmer's \"wedding tackle\" as Rick Wilson put it. What did the New York Times say? Oh, they said Trump was \"energetic.\" Sanewash and softsoap, that's how Trump's lunacy is dealt with. We literally have a mental patient (not to mention convicted felon) running for our nation's highest office and his egregious gaffes go unrecorded in the paper of record for this country.The set up is clear for an explosion. All the signs are there. First of all, the presidential race is ostensibly neck and neck, but as I said here yesterday, the true indicator to watch is early and mail-in voting. If we have a high turnout, that's it for Trump. And so far that's the indication. Another indication is the seven swing states. Many people, James Carville included, do not see this as a one-state debacle, like we had in 2000, when less than 600 votes in Florida determined the election.Here's what is really going on, if you ignore the polls altogether:Now one last thing on the seven swing states and this is the \"giant indicator\" of which I speak. James Carville and a number of other pundits have gone on record that they don't see a 4-3 split. They see it as a 5-2 or maybe 6-1. So where does that leave Trump? Right now all seven swing states are within the statistical margin of error. Trump is \"leading\" in two of them, in Georgia by .9 to 1.8% and in Arizona by 1.1 to 1.7%. In four other swing states, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Nevada, Harris is leading. And in North Carolina, it's the biggest tossup, with Trump leading by .5. But, this is important: that North Carolina lead has tightened since the Mark Robinson debacle.So, following Carville's logic, if a 4-3 split is not likely, then Trump realistically can take two swing states, max, because Harris is leading in the other four. So let's say, just for the sake of argument, he takes Georgia and Arizona. And I would by no means count on that, seeing as how he lost both of those states four years ago. But since he has the largest leads there, let's just go with that math. Georgia has 16 electoral votes, Arizona has 11. So that's 27 electoral votes and he loses all the other swing states, which total 66 votes.And maybe that's how it goes. Biden won both Georgia and Arizona, states which had not previously been won since 1992 or 1996, so maybe they will go back into the Republican column. But how Trump wins without Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Michigan, Wisconsin, or Nevada, I do not see. I think that losing Pennsylvania and North Carolina will be his death knell right there on election night, before we even get to the states out west.And Trump knows it. His events calendar for this week is heavily Pennsylvania and North Carolina. And he gets back to Georgia and also back to Nevada. But all indications are that Trump is clearly worried about North Carolina and Pennsylvania.I think Pennsylvania is gone to Trump and that alone is problematic. I base my assumption on the fact that when Harris entered the race, she not only wiped out a 4-point advantage that Trump had there, she also began to gain an advantage of her own. So I don't think Trump can win in Pennsylvania. Unless talking about the size of Arnold Palmer's dick will get him back the state, who knows? He might still win in North Carolina, because it's so solidly red there, but the fact that he dumped Mark Robinson cold and Robinson has taken to campaigning with cardboard cutouts of Trump or sometimes Trump and Melania says everything you need to know about the solidity of a win in the Tar Heel state.That's my reading of the tea leaves for this hour. I go in search of more.",

    "title": "Trump Flips Fries and Sizzles Harris With An Incredible Stunt In Pennsylvania",
    "content": "Screenshot / X, Trump War Room, Cropped by Resist the MainstreamDonald Trump's recent visit to a McDonald's in Feasterville-Trevose, Pennsylvania, has garnered significant attention as part of his campaign efforts ahead of the 2024 presidential election. During the visit on October 20, 2024, Trump took a hands-on approach, working at the fry station and engaging with customers, all while subtly targeting Vice President Kamala Harris. This event represents Trump's strategy to connect with middle-class voters in a crucial battleground state.As part of his outreach, Trump made remarks that suggested Harris may not have been entirely truthful regarding her past experience at McDonald's while she was studying in college. During the event, Trump joked about having worked \"15 minutes more than Kamala,\" referencing her claims and portraying her as misleading. This comment struck a chord with attendees, many of whom were there to show their support for Trump.The former president expressed his appreciation for McDonald's, recalling previous instances where he defended the chain, including a notable moment during a government shutdown when he ordered a vast quantity of burgers. Trump interacted warmly with the crowd, distributing fries and taking pictures, which amplified the festive atmosphere. Over a thousand supporters cheered for him, reinforcing his appeal among constituents who value direct engagement.The campaign event was closely organized by local Trump supporters, notably Jim Worthington, who is the owner of the Newtown Athletic Club. Coordination involved critical security measures, which featured local police in tactical gear, K-9 units, and Secret Service agents to ensure the safety of the former president and attendees alike.Trump reiterated his skepticism regarding Kamala Harris' assertions about her employment at a McDonald's in California, claiming that McDonald's corporate records could not substantiate her statements. While Harris described her time at the fast-food chain as formative, having worked various positions including the cash register and fry station, Trump's campaign questions the authenticity of her work experience. Harris' team has since defended her claims, asserting that they emphasize her working-class roots.Beyond the fries and jovial interactions, Trump's appearance has broader implications. Pennsylvania is considered a pivotal swing state, known for its substantial electoral votes, making it a key target for both major parties in the upcoming election. Trump's outreach aims to solidify support among voters in this region, which has shown a mix of conservative and progressive sentiments in recent election cycles.As the election draws near, the strategic importance of Pennsylvania cannot be overstated. Trump's antics provide a glimpse into his campaign's focus on relatability and connection with everyday American experiences, gaining traction among constituents who value authenticity and engagement.Trump's playful visit to McDonald's serves not only as a lighthearted moment but as a strategic effort in a battleground state that could very well influence the outcome of the 2024 presidential race. His campaign is utilizing tactics that resonate with working-class voters, positioning him as the candidate who understands their experiences and challenges.Sources:https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/20/politics/mcdonalds-donald-trump-pennsylvania/index.htmlhttps://www.abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/trump-visit-mcdonalds-offers-evidence-harris-work-college-114965009https://www.phillyburbs.com/story/news/local/2024/10/20/donald-trump-works-mcdonalds-drive-thru-in-swing-state-pa-bucks-county-feasterville-harris-election/75754655007/",

I don't want to alienate anyone, and the minute you say, \"I'm a Democrat\" or \"I'm Republican,\" you're kicking off the other side. I want the best person , and I'll pick the one who's most like the way I feel,\" he told bjtonline in 2020.Bradshaw doesn't shy away from criticizing either side. He took a shot at Donald Trump for the former president's criticism of NFL players kneeling for the national anthem in 2017.\"This is America. If our country stands for anything, folks, it's freedom. People died for that freedom. I'm not sure if our President understands those rights. That every American has the right to speak out also to protest. Believe me, these athletes do love our this great country of ours.\"Personally, I think our President should concentrate on North Korea and healthcare rather than ripping into athletes and the NFL,\" he said.Bradshaw has yet to speak out about the 2024 presidential election, but perhaps he will, as we're just weeks away from Election Day at this point.Related: NFL Coach Diagnosed With Cancer At 35 Years Old",

    "content": "President Trump has the Internet buzzing right now over the post he just sent out on TruthSocial.Donald J. Trump@realDonaldTrumpCEASE & DESIST: I, together with many Attorneys and Legal Scholars, am watching the Sanctity of the 2024 Presidential Election very closely because I know, better than most, the rampant Cheating and Skullduggery that has taken place by the Democrats in the 2020 Presidential Election. It was a Disgrace to our Nation! Therefore, the 2024 Election, where Votes have just started being cast, will be under the closest professional scrutiny and, WHEN I WIN, those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law, which will include long term prison sentences so that this Depravity of Justice does not happen again. We cannot let our Country further devolve into a Third World Nation, AND WE WON'T! Please beware that this legal exposure extends to Lawyers, Political Operatives, Donors, Illegal Voters, & Corrupt Election Officials. Those involved in unscrupulous behavior will be sought out, caught, and prosecuted at levels, unfortunately, never seen before in our Country.654 ReTruths 1.61k Likes9/7/24, 6:01 PMPeople are taking all sorts of messages from this...Some think he is implying the people who cheated in 2024 AND 2020 will be prosecuted at unprecedented levels:Others are picking up on the fact Mass Arrests are indeed coming soon according to this post:I continue to believe that President Trump DID in fact catch them all in 2020.This is President Trump waiting to board Marine One in an interview with a reporter where he came right out and said it:\"I caught the swamp. I caught them all. Let's see what happens. Nobody else could have done it but me.\"First, can you imagine Joe Biden holding this interview?Just pure intelligence, pure power, pure strength.President Trump going toe-to-toe with the Crooked Media and absolutely holding court.We all knew Trump was the gold standard (literally) and Biden is not mentally all there, but this clip really underscores just how big of a drop we've suffered.But the real reason I wanted to play this clip for you (clip below) is to make sure we don't forget about what President Trump said here.I believe it's about to become VERY relevant.I believe this clip will be played on a loop on all major news networks after the truth comes out and they are FORCED to cover the story.This clip will go down in history as President Trump telling us all that he already had them dead-to-rights and then he gave them more rope to hang themselves with so he could clean out the cabal once and for all.LISTEN: President Trump Calls In To PA Hearing: \"They got caught! We got them!\"So if he caught them all in 2020 why not release the evidence?He would have been branded a Dictator if he tried to convince everyone he won back in 2020.He had to let time play out.How many times does President Trump have to tell you he often speaks in code and there is MUCH MORE happening behind the scenes than you know?I believe it's all \"Hidden in plain sight\" and just like the ending of The Sixth Sense, once it's all fully revealed, people will look back and be stunned they didn't notice it along the way.Some day, people will look back on these archives and be stunned that we documented it all in real time.Here's one example:HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT: \"We Beat Them TWICE, We Beat The Hell Out Of Them The Second Time!\"UPDATE: More EVIDENCE Hidden In Plain Sight -- Trump Has Been Telling Us All Along!HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT? President Trump's Twitter Banner Predicted The Future?Has most of this over the past 10 years all been scripted? Or at least heavily influenced?I don't know, and I'll let you decide for yourself what you believe, but what I'm about to show you may blow your mind.And it all circles around Butler, PA, -- yes, the town now synonymous with President Trump's near assassination.But it turns out Butler, PA also has some history with the Trump Campaign dating back to 2020.I actually remember this like it was yesterday...COVID was running wild and people were afraid to gather together, but President Trump was holding Rallies anyway -- just doing them outside.And he was holding 2-3 per day, with the last one of the day often stretching to near midnight.One of the most iconic was from, you guessed it, Butler, PA on October 31, 2020 -- just 3 days before the election.Here is a CBS Article headline covering the Rally from back in 2020:Three days before the Election in a battleground swing state, President Trump was showing the world that he could draw tens of thousands of people, outdoors, in the cold (keep in mind, this is PA in late October, it's chilly), at an airport runway strip, at nearly midnight!Meanwhile, Joe Biden could only draw about 10 people and then went to bed at 7:30pm after \"putting a lid\" on the day by lunch time:Because this iconic photo of Butler, PA from 2020 has been President Trump's banner image on Twitter since 2020!There is no publicly available history of Twitter profile/banner image histories available, but according to an article from VOI.ID published in 2022, this is the banner image that was on President Trump's Twitter profile when he was banned from Twitter on January 8, 2021....and it has sat that way to this very day.I know some of you will say \"big deal\" and it's \"just a coincidence\" but it seems quite a strange coincidence to me.You mean to tell me that one of the last and most important MAGA Rallies of 2020 was in Butler, PA, a town of only 13,000 people?Why pick a town of only 13,000 people for such an important Rally?Then you put that image up on Twitter and it remains there to this day?Then you return to Butler, PA 4 years later, still a town of only 13,000 people and that's where he is nearly assassinated? saying \"LOOK HERE!\" and then that's the place where he's nearly assassinated?What are the odds???My mind is blown, but you can each decide what you think.Like always, I leave you with one question: How many of these extremely bizarre coincidences need to happen before you say it's statistically impossible for ALL of these to be just weird coincidences?One of the phrases that gets thrown around so much in the \"Q Community\" (whatever that means) is the idea that we are \"Watching a Show\" and \"you're gonna love how this show ends\".The implication being that large parts of what we are seeing on the world stage are scripted in some way, or being carefully orchestrated.We also have, at this point, the almost certain likelihood that we do have actors in masks pretending to be certain world leaders, at least some of the time.Actors + Masks + Central Casting = ShowOther people push back claiming that is impossible and preposterous.As I sit here, I can't tell you for sure 100% one way or the other, but I do know this....I do know that there are constantly these little disclosures that pop up in the strangest of places that seem to confirm we are watching some form of a show.Credit to my friend JoeRambo for picking up on this clip where they literally say on MSNBC that if you don't see what's happening, then you haven't watched the last 5-6 years of this show.Listen close to this whole clip.First of all, Trump has made the MSM say military tribunals out loud... Brilliant.Second, do you not get a sense of panic in their voices?Third... They literally call what we are watching a \"show\"Patriots in full control.H/T@USA_Infidel247The guy who said it hasn't been on MSNBC for that long.And it doesn't make sense at all in context to assume he is speaking about Speaker Johnson watching MSNBC for the past 5-6 years, does it?So what in the world does that mean?Also, you can't miss that all of this is in the context of them discussing upcoming Military Tribunals, which is something else that the \"Mainstream\" constantly passes off as impossible and preposterous.But this is FAR from an isolated incident.In fact, I've been gathering a master list of all of these little clues popping up.Keep reading and let me know how far you get before you realize it's unlikely that ALL of these are just \"slips of the tongue\" or things with double meaning:I've written a lot about whether we are watching \"Central Casting\" play out on the world stage.For those who don't know what that means, Central Casting is a real company that does exactly what the name suggests: they cast people in movies and TV shows.President Trump references them a lot (I have the clips for you farther below in this article) but the bigger question is whether what you see is not all totally as it seems....And the people who SEEM like they're in charge right now might not really have much power.If any of that seems far-fetched, keep reading and I bet by the end of this article you might be amazed at what you missed -- hiding in plain sight!Now to the video you have to see....There are a ton of videos below in this article, but the first one I'm going to post below really sums things up so well, and in under 2 minutes.I came across this while covering the story below and I thought it was so good I had to share it with you separately:BOMBSHELL: President Trump To Present CLASSIFIED Information Of Election Interference At J6 Indictment TrialWatch this video and see if it doesn't open up your mind a bit:If that has caught your attention, now I'm going to blow your mind wide open:Do we have yet another installment of \"hidden in plain sight\"?I'll report and let YOU decide...As always, each one of these can perhaps be explained away, but how many do we have to see before they become too many to ignore?I'll just keep reporting on them and let you make that decision for yourself.Here's what just happened...During a MAGA Rally yesterday in Iowa, President Trump suddenly help up his folio/binder and eagle-eyes on Twitter noticed it had the Presidential Seal and said PRESIDENT in the bottom right.He is still using a folio with the Presidential Seal and marked The President at the bottom.The only remaining question is whether that has current significance or if he just has a bunch of these leftover from his First Term and he's still using them?That's the question for you to decide.But as you decide that, weigh it in the balance of everything else I'm about to show you below....ESPECIALLY the clip where he says his Second Term is essentially happening right now...Looks like I have to update my \"hidden in plain sight\" article yet again....And this one is about as direct as you can get!You have to see this clip from President Trump yesterday in Anaheim, CA.It's short and powerful, but as you watch this ask yourself one question: does this look like a man who is worried about anything?Or does it look like a man who already holds ALL the evidence and is just waiting for the perfect time and place to play it?My take?You don't talk like this unless you know you already \"have it all\".And if you missed the full speech, I have it for you right here:https://rumble.com/v3lvp96-trump-live-in-anaheim-ca-92923.htmlOk, now for the rest of the \"Hidden in plain sight\" article...It just keeps growing.Read it all right here -- it's getting longer and longer each day!What in the world does this mean?I have now updated this article almost 10 times since originally posting it.This article is a compilation of all the little hints (big hints, really) that President Trump keeps dropping in his speeches.I thought I would just post it once and that would be it, but there is a new once almost every single day.It's starting to become almost impossible to ignore.And so does Derek Johnson who has been doing an excellent job of covering this story.Watch this latest clip right here which is just stunning:\"And in my second term... which is sort of happening now, but I don't want the results, right? I don't want the results of this second term. This second term is a disaster for this Country.\"War is ugly. And we're in it. We've been in it. It's declared in 50 US Code §1550. Has not been terminated.The Federal Continuity Directives, 2017 National Security Strategy, and the other issues under the FCDs address disasters. They're for: before, during, and after a catastrophic event.This is an EPIC Comm. And still separates him as CIC versus President. They're separate.Thank you 2016 Supreme Court for the Military Justice Act of 2016, written in May, for clarifying they're separate, passed in the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (Defense Budget for ALL Armed Forces) on December 23, 2016. Merry Christmas radicalsBoy, did that backfire for the swamp.It's right in front of ya.I'm sorry folks but what does that even mean if you don't accept it at face value?Here was the last one from just a couple days ago...Start piecing these all together and it's an almost impossible message to ignore:This is now probably the 7th or 8th time I've updated this article.The common thread in this article is \"hidden in plain sight\"....all the things Trump keeps telling us in speeches.He still has a Razor Sharp intellect, and at some point you have to ask yourself if these are all just goofs -- or if he's trying to let us know something.You decide, but here's the latest from South Carolina today:Does he perhaps mean when Primary Season is over and he goes on to take on Joe Biden?Or is he telegraphing to us as clearly as he can that there is going to be some form of an intervention before the 2024 election?And ask yourself if all of these are just misspeaks?We all keep asking the same question....If we're watching a movie, when is this thing going to end?And can the end please come soon?Well, you just got a hat tip from President Trump that it might be over sooner than you think!He said something almost identical just a couple days ago!Check this out:Last week I brought you a post highlighting all of the things President Trump has said over the years that appear to have been \"hidden in plain sight\".I liken it to the end of the movie The Sixth Sense, where you saw it the entire movie but didn't really \"see it\" until the reveal at the end.It was all hidden right in plain sight -- and you missed it.I didn't think so at first, but eventually you see too much to ignore.The latest little quote from President Trump that seems innocuous at first but when you start looking for these things they jump out to you like a sore thumb!\"Sooner than you think\"Trump: \"We're gonna take back the Senate, take back the House, we're gonna take back the White House - and sooner than you think. It's going to be really something special...\"Keep reading and tell me below in the Comments how much is too much to continue to ignore it?Trump has been telling us all along?This is now the THIRD TIME I've updated this article.More information just keeps coming in...I'll mark the updated information below so you can see it.Or just read the whole thing in full again, there is SO MUCH to soak in!So in my original article, I argued that perhaps President Trump has been telling us the truth all along and we just haven't noticed it.The truth about what?Well, the truth about the Military Operation being conducted by the White Hats -- or however you want to phrase it.But assuming there is a team of \"Good Guys\" working to save this Country, would we see any evidence of it?We certainly see evidence of the horror Joe Biden has brought on this Country...but is there evidence that the White Hats are also running their playbook?I'll copy my original article below so you can see all of that in case you missed it -- there's a lot in there!But first I want to show you a bunch of new stuff.I'll just put it out here and let you decide after you read everything.Huge credit to my friend Joe Rambo (@Brainstorm_Joe on X) for putting together this incredible thread.Ok, we start here and please read and watch everything first because it all fits together. One particular video may not mean a ton on its own, but you put them all together and eventually it tells a pretty compelling story:How is Trump so confident in telling Karri that something good is going to happen.Something much bigger....?Because they caught them all. Including the 2022 midterm thefts.Space force had an aircraft up for 908 days.It's called X-37B.It took off shortly before the 2020 election and landed just after the 2022 election.Coincidence?Or do they have it all?Was the military the only way?Read the rest of this thread.What we are watching is awesome.What an amazing time to be alive.From this point forward.We will not announce when we will attack.But attack we will.This is a wartime president who was attacked personally from every angle.As our country was also attacked.Watch the clips in this thread.I believe it makes he reference to the \"pause\" impossible to deny.Patriots are in control.I believe the MSM was well aware Trump was telling the truth in these moments.The summer of love and the media attacks ramped up like crazy leading into 2020 for exactly that reason.But Trump put safeguards in place.He signed EO's.He placed certain people like Ezra and Miller in positions.He promised to give the government back to the people on day 1.The \"pause\" is part of keeping that promise.The military was the only way.It had to be this way to minimize loss of life.To ensure public safety. NCSWIC.11/08/19 Trump was already telling you they spent millions of dollars investigating and trying to find corruption. Wanna know why Joe Biden is a different guy? Why he doesn't know he is alive? Why he is shot? The answer is right here. Joe Biden is a crook. If you think no one did anything about it.. I suggest reading the rest of this thread.Let it simmer for a while and let people see what Radical Left Democrats will do to our country!More proof that Patriots are in control.Remember that this is an information war.Nothing is as it seems.Connect the dots.Trump re-truthed this post of himself telling us that he could go right in and fix it fast.But rather they chose to let it simmer for a while.\"Let them see what radical left Democrats will do to our country\"And to boot, the post is overplayed with a literal Q drop. 4461 to be specific.Sometimes you can't tell the public the truth.YOU MUST SHOW THEM. ONLY THEN WILL PEOPLE FIND THE WILL TO CHANGE.It had to be this way.This is not another 4-year election.GOD WINS.Q Can you see it yet?He called it the \"pause\"They have it all.Still think he did nothing about it?Let's see what happens.Translation: I Donald Trump have made moves and signed orders so that we can put the government on pause.During this period, we will run a multi layered psyop for multiple reasons.Our country was infiltrated. Our citizens were divided and lulled into slavery.To correct these issues, we have written a story and produced a show/cover story.The show will allow the American people to see what we were up against and, in turn, weoponizing the people... all while saving the kids, revamping the financial system, and derooting corruption of every form globally.We are 100% reaching the precipice.It is time. It had to be this way.And it's glorious. What a time to be alive.He told us so many times.We just couldn't comprehend how yuge the operation was and therefore what the timeline would be.I can't wait to make the documentary. I want to name it \"Hind sight is 2020\"Vindicating and celebrating all of the anons that picked up on the truth even prior to the fake 2020 election. \"The Pause\"In the face of adversity anons and patriots heald the line.You can feel the excitement in the air.As Trump is calling g it. \"2024 is our final battle\"NCSWIC. Nothing.Who remembers when the National Guard took an oath to act as US Marshals for 1 year right before \"Joe Biden's\" inauguration?What are the duties of a US Marshal?The duties of the U.S. Marshals Service include protecting the federal judiciary, apprehending federal fugitives, managing and selling seized assets acquired by criminals through illegal activities, housing and transporting federal prisoners and operating the Witness Security Program.The inauguration was provably false. The wreath ceremony and the 21 gun salute were provably false.Trump told us \"I don't think it's him\"\"I caught em. I caught em all. Now let's see what happens.\"\"The pause is a beautiful thing. If there is such a thing. And it's a beautiful thing.\"Are y'all starting to put it together yet?Drip. Drip. Drip. Flood.Sometimes you can't tell. You must show.\"It will be much easier to do what must be done. Bc everyone will agree with us.\"Y'all ready for the good part? Because here it comes...I'm just throwing this out there and you can make of it what you will...You could chalk it all up to just common phrases used over and over with no bigger meaning or purpose behind them.But I'm starting to wonder if perhaps they do have meaning.I'm starting to wonder if we truly are going to see and end to this \"movie\" play out soon, and I'm wondering if when we look back in hindsight if it will be a \"Sixth Sense\" moment.You remember that movie?(30 year old) SPOILER ALERT: In one of the most legendary twists to end a movie of all time, you find out at the end that Bruce Willis has been dead the whole time.You immediately ask yourself, \"But....how can that be?\"We saw him talking to people throughout the movie, did they know he was dead?But then the flashbacks start and you quickly realize you didn't really see what you thought you saw.It was all hidden in plain view, but you missed it.The entire audience missed it for the whole movie.But when you look back, it's obvious.And I wonder if that's how this \"movie\" is going to end.Will we look back and see that Trump was telling us BIG clues all along?Will we look back and see it was all hidden in plain sight?For those who don't know, Central Casting is a real company that specializes in providing actors and background actors for movies.Gee, isn't that interesting?Again, it could just be a phrase, but he sure does seem to say it a LOT!Here he is point blank telling us \"I caught them all\".I'm not sure how else to interpret that other than at face value.Which leads to the question I know you're probably asking at this point....Ok, if this IS a movie being allowed to play out and if President Trump DID catch them all, then what is he waiting for?Why is this taking so long?Well, I have a theory about that and I'll explain it to you right here:This is HUGE folks...I am literally bouncing a bit in my seat as I type this one.For years, I have told you my theory is that President Trump already has ALL the evidence.Confirmation of the 2020 Election Steal (we know they watched and logged it all in realtime from that SCIF)...All the goods on the Biden Family treason...All the evidence of the multiple Unconstitutional actions taken against President Trump which also amount to Treason and election interference to name just a couple crimes....Call it common sense or intuition or a gut feeling or reading between the lines but in light of everything they've thrown at him and his family, he looks WAY too calm to me to be managing all of this if he didn't already know he had won....Then last week a lady named Jan Halper-Hayes went on GBN and told the world that theory is 100% correct.I mean, she basically reiterated my theory word-for-word and even went farther than anything I've ever speculated.We covered it and that was excited, but then a couple other things happened and that's where we now advance the story.First, Don Jr. posted a link to her full interview, essentially giving it his stamp of approval.Not only reposted it but gave it his clear endorsement and confirmed it was TRUE.I told you, this movie is just about over and you are going to LOVE how it ends!To watch the full interview and to read my entire theory, keep reading below...In fact, thanks to Jack Smith's new charges against President Trump it seems we now have the perfect forum to actually litigate the 2020 election.And its with that backdrop that I have to show you this brand new interview on England's GBN (which I assume stands for Great Britain News) featuring Dr. Jan Halper-Hayes.Dr. Halper-Hayes is a political strategist who was on the Trump Transition Team and who is a frequent guest on BBC, CNBC, CNN and Breitbart.Listen carefully: Trump is about to play an ace card. I don't think the two interviewing Jan Halper-Hayes understand the clever manueuvring of the Trump team.He can subpoena and call witnesses. Its all about to all come out. \"Trump has got the goods\" He has the evidence of it all.Nice journalists but coming across as a little bit dim here. This reminds me of Liz Truss trying to deal with Putin. Completely out of their depth. #TrumpArrest #USAHoly Smokes! Listen to this!Jan Halper-Hayes, who sits on a TaskForce for the Department of Defense Talks Trumps Subpoena Power and EO 13848- How the DoD & Trump Has All the Goods on the 2020 Election... The US is a BANKRUPT CORPORATION - SPACE FORCE\"They've made a HUGE HUGE mistake with this one... Because even though they thought what was gonna happen was that they were going to go after him for treason or sedition, but they did criminally charge him, but they didn't go to that extreme.As a result, he has due process so he can subpoena people and bring things in.Let me say something about this 2020 election. Biden is the legitimate president, but he's a legitimate president of what is now the BANKRUPT US CORPORATION.That wa SA treaty in 1871. On September 12, 2018... Trump created a. Executive Order. Within that, he outlined in any future elections, any kind of foreign or domestic interference, specifically for the 2020 election.(That EO Fam is 13848, the one Joe Biden keeps renewing).How did he know some of these things were going to happen?..>What what this has done is open the door for Trump to present his case....>It's a great mistake by Jack Smith that he's done that...Think about Edward Snowden & all the information he had.Think about the fact that our military, our Department of Defense, SPACE FORCE... if you think that they don't have the actual real results from the election, then you're fooling yourself....>>She goes on to talk about 2000 mules and the 60 court cases the media lies about that were rejected....\"There were 3... he won 2 & lost 1, 57 were never heard because they had no standing. Standing means the person bringing the case has to claim some kind of impact or injury....>>I sit on a task force at the Department of Defense & they've got the goods. And Trump knew if he presented the evidence early of the goods early on, we'd have a Civil War & he felt that the people had to see how bad it could really get.\"BOOMAnd from Trump's attorney John Lauro, he confirms many of the same details:Be careful what you wish for Jack Smith, it looks like you just might get it!",

    "content": "\"Make Bitcoin Great Again\" hats displayed for sale at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Tennessee, US, on Saturday, July 27, 2024. Former US President Trump used to be a crypto critic but in recent weeks adopted a much friendlier stance alongside the sector's emergence as an influential player in the 2024 presidential election through big donations to a political action committee.With the 2024 election hitting its homestretch, the leading pro-crypto super PAC has funneled a big chunk of its final donations to close House races as part of an effort to push candidates favorable to the group's agenda over the top.Fairshake, which has been one of the top spenders across any industry this election cycle, doled out nearly $29 million in September, according to Federal Election commission data released to the public on Sunday. Of that sum, $20 million went to two affiliated PACs -- $15 million to the Defend American Jobs PAC, a single-issue committee focused on cryptocurrency and blockchain policy that's favored Republicans, and $5 million to Protect Progress, which has only supported Democrats.The remaining $8.8 million spent by Fairshake last month mostly went to House races in New York, Nevada and California, according to FEC data compiled by crypto market and blockchain analyst James Delmore and verified by CNBC.Several of those races are considered toss-ups by the Cook Political Report. Among the recipients were Southern California Republicans David G. Valadao and Michael Garcia, who are both in tights contests to keep their seats. They've received $1.3 million and $1 million, respectively.\"The Fairshake donations to the California candidates in toss-up districts are important not only to get pro-crypto candidates elected in House seats that could go either way, but also because a lot of crypto companies are still located in California,\" Delmore said. \"California needs all of the pro-crypto politicians they can get.\"Additionally, Fairshake gave more than $1.9 million to Rep. Patrick Ryan (D-NY), over $1.7 million to Rep. Steven Horsford (D-Nev.) and almost $1 million to Rep. Angela Dawn Craig (D-Minn.). The remaining cash went to a mix of candidates in Illinois, Colorado, Oregon, Iowa and Arkansas.Of the House donations, $6.2 million went to Democratic candidates and $2.3 million to Republicans. In the September window, Protect Progress gave more than $10 million apiece to Democrats running for Senate in Arizona and Michigan.For the 2024 cycle, political donations from or supporting the crypto industry reached around $190 million, with contributions coming from some of the biggest names in the sector. A report from Public Citizen in August found that crypto companies have accounted for nearly half of all donations made by corporations this election cycle.Crypto groups have spent over $130 million in congressional races for this year's election, including the primaries, according to FEC data.Delmore told CNBC that donations to Fairshake have been tepid the last few months.In September, the group added around $1.1 million, with $800,000 coming from crypto firm Consensys, which was sued by the SEC in June, and $1,000 from Moonsong Labs CEO Derek Yoo.In total, Fairshake has raised more than $160 million and disbursed over $37 million to support House candidates and to run ads opposing Democrat Katie Porter, who lost in the California Senate primary. More than $84 million was transferred to Fairshake's affiliate PACs.",

    "content": "On an unseasonably warm October evening in eastern Nebraska on Saturday, with only 17 days until the 2024 presidential election, both the Harris and Trump campaigns descended upon the Cornhusker State to deliver a similar message to its 2nd Congressional District: their votes could singularly decide the outcome of the race.Nebraska is one of two states -- Maine is the other -- that doesn't award Electoral College votes on a winner-take-all basis. The winner of the popular vote in the state gets two votes and the other three are divided by the winner in each of the state's congressional districts.On Saturday, Democratic vice presidential nominee and Nebraska native son Tim Walz held a 1,400-person rally in the 2nd District -- the Democratic-leaning area around Omaha, or \"blue dot\" -- that could deliver the Kamala Harris-Walz ticket one decisive Electoral College vote, despite recent efforts from Donald Trump and other Republicans to make the historically red state switch to winner-take-all that would likely hand the former president all of the state's votes.MORE: Key Nebraska Republican opposes Trump effort to change state's electoral vote process\"And I have to tell you, I think all of you know this, this thing is going to be close... the 'Blue Wall' is going to hold across the north of America -- Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Minnesota,\" Walz said, indicating his confidence in winning those industrial states that proved critical in getting President Joe Biden across the 270 Electoral College vote threshold to win the presidency in 2020.\"But you do the math,\" Walz added, counting the states again. \"269 -- one dot makes a difference. Look -- 'Blue Dot,' you're inspiring the rest of the country.\"\"Omaha, put us over the top,\" Walz concluded his rally on Saturday.Across town, former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard campaigned for former President Donald Trump, also telling the crowd in the state's 2nd Congressional District just how influential their ballots could be in November.Kennedy alerted a different 1,400-person audience in a downtown Hilton ballroom that their district was voting in the \"most critical election in this country.\"\"We could still end up 269 to 269 ... Your votes are the most important votes in the United States today, and that's why we need to win that state,\" he said.The possibility that Trump and Harris tie at 269-269 -- where neither hits the 270 electoral votes required to win the presidency -- isn't out of the question in a race forecasted by pundits and pollsters to be close.On Saturday, Kennedy laid out a hypothetical election night scenario that he said was based on internal polling he conducted while he was a candidate, in which Harris wins Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and Trump wins North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada, and Arizona.In that scenario, there would be 269- 269 tie, he said. Kennedy highlighted then that one Electoral College vote in a state like Nebraska or Maine could push one candidate over the top.Gabbard encouraged the audience to \"convince\" other voters in the district to vote for Trump.\"You could be that swing district that will either save our country or continue us down this path towards darkness and destruction,\" she said. \"I want you to think about how close these elections can be, and this single congressional district in particular.\"\"So as you leave here tonight, I really hope you take the time to go through the contacts that you have in your phone or your Facebook friends or your coworkers, and seriously, go down name by name, and think about who you can reach out to, that you can maybe convince them about why they should vote for President Trump in this election,\" Gabbard added.According to the Harris campaign, it has been on the ground in the district for \"months,\" holding weekly phone banking and canvass events out of three field offices in Omaha. In the last four days, the campaign said 100 Harris for Nebraska volunteers have spoken to more than 6,400 voters in the district.\"We are, we're just like this tiny, little blue dot in this red state, we but we have a voice, and we want to be heard, and especially in this election, this election is so important,\" Meg Hawks, a Democrat from Omaha told ABC News at Walz's rally.\"The blue dot has made our city and our state even just such a joyful place, and we have,\" she said. \"I personally feel joyful about this, I feel joyful about Tim Walz coming from Nebraska, and joyful about Kamala Harris' policies.\"Nebraska has been a hot topic nationally many times this cycle -- first for the possibility it might change its Electoral College process into one more favorable to Trump and taking away power from the \"Blue Dot,\" and now for its increasingly competitive House and Senate races that could determine the balance of power in both chambers.There is no Democrat running for Senate in Nebraska but independent Dan Osborn is being quietly (and sometimes not so quietly) backed by the party over incumbent Republican Sen. Deb Fischer. Walz didn't mention the Senate race or its candidates at his rally on Saturday, but he did boost state Rep. Tony Vargas, who is running as a Democrat in the 2nd District.\"We're going to need a Congress that actually knows what work looks like for the American people -- send Tony Vargas there and put Democrats in charge,\" Walz said.At the Hilton, Kennedy and Gabbard did not once mention either the Senate or congressional races in the district. But Democratic attendees at Walz's rally on Saturday were buzzing about Senate race.\"I'm very cautiously optimistic that Dan Osborn will win. He's getting momentum and I think people are tired by what she has not done, she really doesn't have anything to show,\" said Monica Kruger, a rally attendee from Omaha.Judy Sterba, an Omahan who was also at the rally, said she was working hard to get both Vargas and Osborne to Washington.\"I have yard signs and I write postcards all over the country to get people to register to vote. So I'm giving money all the time to everybody. I think it's really important, and I really want Tony Vargas to win, and Dan Osborne. I like the candidate, and I really hate Deb for sure. So that's a really good reason for me,\" she said, noting that Senate control was \"absolutely\" a reason she was also supporting Osborn.\" got a real good shot, a real good shot,\" she said, noting his rapid rise over the past few months.\"I was at Jazz on the Green, which is a summer music festival, probably in like July. Somebody came around saying, 'Can you sign for Dan Osborne to get on the ballot?' I'm like, 'Seriously, this late?' This guy has a chance, and he's been working his ass off. He's got a ton of support,\" she said.",

    "content": "Former wrestler Hulk Hogan dismissed polling data indicating a tight 2024 presidential election, and said instead it will be a \"landside\" in support of former President Donald Trump.The wrestling icon made a major splash when he spoke at the Republican National Convention, in which he endorsed the former president to \"let Trumpamania run again.\" Since then, Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, has been traveling across the country to promote his new beer brand, and has discovered through his travels that \"everybody's for Trump.\"\"So I hear what you're saying about the polls, and it's even-Steven, and it might be a close call, but let me tell you something, I don't believe the polls,\" Hogan said on Fox News's One Nation with Brian Kilmeade. \"It's going to be a landslide. Too big to rig, brother, is the theme here, and at the end of the day, all of America wants to get back to America. Not the way it used to be, but the way it should be, brother.\"Hogan also addressed Trump's appearance at the Al Smith dinner, which he praised for Trump's various jokes, including one aimed at \"white dudes for Harris.\" In addition to Trump's comedic ability, Hogan also spoke highly of Trump's business experience, and claimed \"that's what this country needs.\"Featured Local Savings\"We want God in our homes, and in our schools, and in our country,\" Hogan said. \"We basically want safety, we want, basically, to have great lives, and we want to be able to economically afford to live a good life and take care of our children.

Everything I hear on the other side is supposed to be hope and happy, it all sounds like doom and gloom to me.\"Hogan compared Trump's campaign platform to the \"Americana\" platform that then-President John F.

He noted how many people and neighbors across the country will not talk to each other due to political differences, so he decided to start his beer brand to \"bring the country back together one beer at a time.\"With just a few weeks left before the 2024 presidential election, RealClearPolitics's polling average shows Trump holding a two-point national lead over Harris. Presidential historian Allan Lichtman, however, has predicted that these polls are \"underestimating Democratic voting strength,\" noting that similar polls in 2016 were underestimating Republican voter turnout.",

Danko repeatedly heaped criticism at ex-health minister Zuzana Dolinkova (Voice-SD). Both Danko and Majersky hope that the necessary measures will be unveiled by new Health Minister Kamil Sasko (Voice-SD), but Majersky added that the health portfolio must receive attention also from the Prime Minister. \"This can't remain the agenda of only a single governing political party. The Prime Minister must get personally involved to make sure that sufficient financial resources are routed to the health sector and a good consolidation is carried out,\" he said. Also broached was the issue of the House chair post, left vacant since the 2024 presidential election in April due to ongoing disagreements within the coalition as to which party should claim the post. Danko stated that he respects the fact that House Vice-chair Peter Ziga (Voice-SD) has been tasked with heading Parliament in a temporary capacity. \"Even though I harbour objections to him having full powers,\" he said. Majersky claimed that the fact Parliament hasn't had a proper chair for so long is an embarrassment to Slovakia. The party chairmen discussed the military conflict in Ukraine as well. Danko reiterated that he's against Ukraine joining NATO and, at this stage, even the EU, and rejects supplies of weapons to Kiev. \"We have a problem within the coalition over this,\" he said. Majersky declared that he supports Ukraine's accession to both the EU and NATO, but only after Slovakia's eastern neighbor meets all necessary prerequisites to join. mf",

    "title": "Trump's closing speech to voters begins with crude attacks and lewd story about Hall of Fame golfer",
    "content": "Donald Trump has decided to present his final argument to voters before the home stretch of his race for the White House.At least that's what his campaign said Saturday as the former president took the stage in Latrobe, Pennsylvania.But shortly after emerging following a professional wrestler's musical entrance, Trump quickly launched into a rambling anecdote about the late Arnold Palmer, the golf legend for whom the local airport is named. The story, which seemed to serve no purpose beyond invoking a regional icon and lasted nearly 15 minutes, included tangents about Palmer's immense wealth and several offhand remarks about the naked body of the Hall of Fame.Arnold Palmer was entirely a man, and I say that, with all due respect to women, I love women. This man was strong and tough, and I refused to say it, but when he took a shower with the other pros, they came out of there, they said Oh my god. It's incredible, Trump said.The anecdote made a rally participant react, I didn't expect to hear that this evening.From there, Trump invited Antonio Brown, a former Pittsburgh Steelers star with a troubling legal history, on stage, called his Democratic opponent Kamala Harris a shitty vice president and attacked mail-in voting as screens urged his supporters to vote by mail earlier.Between the vulgar and bizarre moments, there were glimpses of a final speech. Trump, reading from a teleprompter, told the crowd: \"With your support, we will bring back strength, dominance, prosperity and pride to our nation.\" This will be America's new golden age; 100 years from now, the 2024 presidential election will be seen as Americas greatest victory.He also watched a video of Harris expressing support for banning fracking, an issue important to many voters in the Keystone State.At other times, however, Trump interrupted his written remarks just as he seemed about to deliver the heart of his campaign's message, the kind of message that might be cut for broadcast on local television stations in Pittsburgh.This election is a choice between four years of incredible failure or four years just as horrible. Everything they touch turns into Trump, he says, pausing.The crowd responded with the corresponding expletive.The rally kicked off two days of Trump appearances in Pennsylvania, a battleground that both campaigns have prioritized both on the airwaves and in their programs. Trump will hold a town hall meeting outside Philadelphia on Saturday. He also plans to attend the Pittsburgh Steelers game and stop at McDonald's to work as a fry cook, a visit intended to troll Harris' work experience at the Golden Arches.Before Latrobe's event, Trump's campaign suggested the former president would begin tailoring his message based on the urgency of the moment and the contrast between the two candidates.I think today's remarks are important because it's the beginning of that thinking, said Jason Miller, a top Trump adviser. His pitch will be presented in full at a planned rally at Madison Square Garden in a week, Miller added.There was little, however, to differentiate Trump's remarks from the dozens of speeches he gave during the campaign. He attacked migrants and the mental competence of his opponents. He complained about the legal proceedings against him as ex-president and the investigation into Russian election interference that haunted the early years of his presidency.Saturday's erratic performance before a smaller-than-usual crowd that lacked energy during the pre-show followed a string of recent appearances that deviated from expectations.Trump's rally in Detroit notably failed to fill the room reserved by his campaign and when he took the stage, Trump was interrupted by technical problems with his microphone. The former president stood awkwardly by the lectern while waiting for it to be repaired, then vowed to stiff the contractor who supplied the sound system.Earlier in the week, Trump decided to stop taking questions at the town hall after a member of his audience suffered a medical issue. Instead, he called songs to play over the sound system while swaying and waving his arms on stage, then left after 40 minutes without answering any further questions.These incidents played a role in recent attacks from Harris and her allies, who claimed that Trump had become unhinged and less stable in the final days of the race. They also used Trump's decision to cancel high-profile interviews with 60 Minutes and CNBC as evidence that the former president's travel schedule had caught up with that of the 78-year-old former president.Speaking in Detroit on Friday, Trump pushed back against suggestions that he had lost a step.It's now been 48 days without rest and I have this loser who doesn't have the energy of a rabbit, he says.The next day, in Latrobe, he gave a public demonstration of his ability to persevere for about an hour and 40 minutes.Still, Trump looked forward to the moment when he could put his third White House bid in the rearview mirror.We've been through so much together, Trump said, that the finish line is finally in sight.What Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes OnlineLOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 24, 2020, / Compare-autoinsurance.Org has launched a new blog post that presents the main benefits of comparing multiple car insurance quotes.

    "title": "Elon Musk Joins Trump: Unveiling Controversies and Campaign Surprises",
    "content": "Elon Musk has thrown his support behind former President Donald Trump as the 2024 presidential election approaches, with a strong focus on Pennsylvania, a state that could be pivotal for both candidates. Musk has become increasingly involved in rallying support for Trump, with his campaign highlighting frustrations over government regulations that he argues hinder business innovation and efficiency.Musk has openly criticized bureaucratic obstacles, advocating for a reduction in red tape to promote economic growth. In a recent rally, he revealed plans to discuss a bizarre government request involving SpaceX, suggesting that the company was once asked to conduct research on the effects of sonic booms on marine life, including seals. Musk's reference to such absurd demands underscores his perspective on regulatory overreach.Highlighting his experiences with regulatory structures, Musk mentioned a notable fine imposed on SpaceX by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for using drinking water to cool a launch pad. He pointed out that such activities typically do not require permits, reiterating his call for increased government efficiency and a reassessment of spending. Musk has linked such overspending practices to ongoing inflation, emphasizing the need for fiscal responsibility.During a campaign appearance, Trump humorously suggested that Musk could take on the role of \"Secretary of Cost-Cutting\" in a future administration aimed at reforming government expenditures. With Musk's backing, Trump's campaign sees a potential advantage in attracting undecided voters, particularly in key demographic groups within Pennsylvania.Democratic Senator John Fetterman has recognized the impact Musk could have on the election, cautioning that Musk's appeal may resonate with voters that Democrats cannot afford to dismiss. The senator highlighted the necessity for his party to engage with Musk's growing influence, particularly in a state that holds significant electoral weight.In addition to in-person events, Musk has leveraged his platform X (formerly Twitter) to bolster support for Trump, sharing information and rallying enthusiasm among followers. His campaign messaging focuses on key themes such as economic freedom, individual rights, and the importance of preserving the Constitution, resonating with conservative values.Musk's commitment extends to significant financial support for Trump's campaign, with reports indicating over $70 million funneled through his America PAC aimed at mobilizing Republican voters across critical states, including Pennsylvania. This financial backing, coupled with Musk's media presence, presents a formidable challenge to the Democrats as they strategize for the upcoming election.While Musk's involvement in politics isn't unprecedented, his substantial personal wealth and vast influence raise questions about the role of wealthy individuals in shaping political dynamics. His public endorsements of Trump and critique of current government practices present a scenario that underscores the intersection of business, innovation, and political advocacy in today's landscape.As the election approaches, the ramifications of Musk's support for Trump remain to be seen, but both parties are keenly aware of the influence he wields in mobilizing voters and shaping public discourse around key issues.Sources:",

He was joined by former Steelers stars Antonio Brown and Le'Veon Bell at the Rally.Pennsylvania is considered a critical swing state in the upcoming presidential election. The last four election winners have also won the state's electoral votes.He will be in attendance as the Jets look to pick up their third win of the season against the Steelers on the road.

Adams and current quarterback Aaron Rogers were teammates together while both members of the Green Bay Packers.

As the race tightens and early voting begins, both candidates are eager to shore up support in states that could decide the outcome of the 2024 presidential election.Kamala Harris's rallies in Detroit, Michigan, and Atlanta, Georgia, featured prominent figures from the music industry, showcasing the Democratic candidate's strong appeal among younger, more diverse voters. In Detroit, Lizzo energized the crowd with a speech that went beyond party lines, emphasizing the importance of having a president who listens to the people.\"Whether you're a Democrat or Republican or neither, you deserve a president who listens when you speak,\" Lizzo said, addressing the crowd while wearing a white pantsuit, a nod to the suffragette movement. She called for respect for protests and the people's voice, framing Harris as the leader who embodies these values. To roaring applause, she added a reference to her hit song, declaring, \"It's about damn time!\"-a call for America to finally have its first woman president.Later, in Atlanta, another pop superstar, Usher, rallied support for Harris, reminding voters of the high stakes in Georgia, a state that has become crucial in determining the outcome of national elections. \"I'm counting on you to get Harris's campaign across the finish line in Georgia,\" Usher told the crowd, urging them to turn out in large numbers during early voting.At both rallies, Harris took the opportunity to criticize her opponent, Donald Trump, framing him as out of touch and exhausted. In Detroit, she argued that Trump's platform is \"self-consuming,\" focusing on personal grievances rather than real solutions for the American people. \"We stand for the idea that the true measure of the strength of a leader is not based on who you beat down, it's on who you lift up,\" Harris said, emphasizing her message of support for the working and middle classes.In Atlanta, Harris ramped up her attacks on Trump, pointing out that he had canceled interviews and ducked debates because of \"exhaustion.\" She also highlighted his tendency to \"go off script and ramble\" during rallies, mocking his inability to finish a coherent thought. Harris, sharp in her delivery, dubbed his speeches \"nonsense,\" pointing out the disjointed nature of his public addresses. It was a clear effort to frame Trump as physically and mentally unfit for the presidency, a theme the Harris campaign has been increasingly highlighting as Election Day approaches.Meanwhile, Donald Trump's response to Harris's criticisms came in the form of a lengthy rally in Pennsylvania, a state he views as critical to his electoral victory. Trump's rally, held in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, at an airport named after the legendary golfer Arnold Palmer, was classic Trump-filled with meandering speeches, attacks on Harris, and fiery appeals to his base.Trump's performance was as much about proving his stamina as it was about reinforcing his campaign message. At 78 years old, Trump sought to combat accusations of fatigue by delivering a 90-minute speech, showcasing his ability to keep the energy high as he makes his case to voters. He began his speech with a lengthy monologue about Palmer, but quickly pivoted to more familiar territory-attacking migrants, denigrating Harris, and repeating false claims about the 2020 election.Despite Harris's jabs about his inability to stay on topic, Trump's audience remained enthusiastic, cheering him on as he spoke about issues such as border security and economic growth. He also made a significant play for working-class voters by bringing steel workers on stage, emphasizing his appeal to blue-collar voters who have been a key part of his electoral base. Trump attempted to link his personal success to their struggles, recalling his expensive education at the Ivy League University of Pennsylvania but contrasting that with his admiration for the hard work of the steelworkers beside him.\"If we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole damn thing,\" Trump declared, underscoring the importance of the state's 19 electoral votes in his path to victory. Trump's campaign has been heavily focused on Pennsylvania, a state he narrowly lost to Joe Biden in 2020 but is determined to reclaim in 2024.Adding to the spectacle of Trump's Pennsylvania push was billionaire Elon Musk, who has become one of Trump's most visible supporters in this election cycle. Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and the owner of X (formerly Twitter), has donated nearly $75 million to Trump's America PAC, cementing his role as a key figure in the Republican's reelection bid.Musk, who endorsed Trump earlier in the summer, has positioned himself as a vocal critic of the Biden administration, often criticizing its policies on social media. In Pennsylvania, Musk added a new element to his involvement by announcing that his organization would be randomly distributing $1 million each day until Election Day to a registered voter in the state who signs a petition supporting Trump. This unusual campaign tactic is likely to further solidify Musk's status as a divisive yet powerful figure in American politics.As both campaigns move into the final stretch, polls suggest the race is effectively tied. Harris and Trump are pouring resources into battleground states like Michigan, Georgia, and Pennsylvania, where early voting is already underway. Both candidates recognize that the next three weeks will determine the trajectory of the country for the next four years.Harris's focus on the middle class, equity, and democracy contrasts sharply with Trump's appeals to populism, economic nationalism, and nostalgia for his previous term. Both candidates are tapping into different visions for America, and the razor-thin margins in key states indicate that the final outcome is far from certain.What is clear, however, is that the stakes are higher than ever. With star power, big promises, and relentless campaigning, Harris and Trump are battling on every front in an election that could reshape the future of the nation.",

    "title": "Musk warns of censorship under potential Kamala Harris presidency - BLiTZ",
    "content": "At a rally for Republican candidate Donald Trump in Pennsylvania on October 19, tech billionaire Elon Musk warned that a Kamala Harris presidency could usher in a sweeping crackdown on free speech in the United States. The Tesla and X (formerly Twitter) CEO expressed concerns about a potential Harris administration, calling it a \"big government machine\" that would prioritize censorship under the guise of combating disinformation. Musk's remarks underscored his evolving political views and deepening involvement in US political discourse, particularly as the 2024 presidential election approaches.Musk's criticism of Kamala Harris revolves primarily around what he sees as her administration's potential crackdown on freedom of speech. \"We'll see a lot of censorship under a sort of Kamala regime,\" Musk stated. He described Harris as \"just a puppet,\" arguing that her administration would represent the interests of a bureaucratic machine rather than the will of the people. \"If the teleprompter breaks, she doesn't know what to say,\" Musk added, implying that Harris lacks genuine leadership and autonomy, functioning more as a figurehead for an expansive governmental system.One of Musk's key concerns is the continued focus on combatting so-called disinformation, which he argues is often a pretext for controlling narratives and silencing dissent. \"There's clearly a strong push for censorship under the guise of fighting disinformation. But disinformation is really a propaganda word,\" Musk claimed. His argument centers around the idea that labeling information as false or misleading is inherently subjective and dangerous when controlled by the government. \"Who's going to decide what disinformation is? The government? That's crazy,\" Musk declared, asserting that no governmental body should have the authority to dictate what constitutes acceptable speech.Musk's warnings about censorship under Harris are rooted in her past actions regarding online speech and content moderation. As Vice President, Kamala Harris has made it clear that she believes social media platforms have a responsibility to address harmful content. In June 2022, she spearheaded the creation of the White House Task Force to Address Online Harassment and Abuse, specifically targeting online harassment against women and the LGBTQ community. The task force, according to Harris, was aimed at holding platforms accountable for their role in spreading harmful speech and misinformation.Moreover, Harris has been vocal about her dissatisfaction with how social media platforms manage content, referring to them as purveyors of \"hate\" and \"misinformation.\" In 2019, Harris pushed for social media companies to be held accountable for the spread of harmful content, a stance that has earned her praise from advocates of stricter internet regulations and criticism from free speech absolutists like Musk.Beyond his concerns about government censorship, Musk also took aim at the broader media landscape, accusing legacy media outlets of operating as propaganda machines. \"Actually, in the US, people are starting to realize that the legacy media is just a propaganda machine,\" Musk said, noting that American audiences are growing increasingly skeptical of mainstream news outlets. According to Musk, more people are rejecting the traditional media narrative, and he sees this as a positive development. \"The European audience still thinks the news is real,\" he added, suggesting that American consumers of news are becoming more discerning compared to their European counterparts.Musk's distrust of the media echoes a growing sentiment among certain segments of the population, particularly conservatives and independents, who feel that mainstream outlets are biased or untrustworthy. His assertion that Americans are waking up to media manipulation aligns with a broader trend of disillusionment with established news sources, which many see as serving specific political agendas rather than providing impartial reporting.While Musk has previously positioned himself as politically neutral, he has increasingly aligned himself with Donald Trump and the Republican Party. During the Pennsylvania rally, Musk reiterated his support for Trump, calling the notion that Trump is \"a danger to democracy\" both \"bizarre and hypocritical.\" Musk highlighted what he perceives as a fundamental contradiction in how Trump and President Joe Biden have been treated by the political establishment. He criticized Biden's removal from the race, calling it \"incredibly undemocratic,\" though Biden is still technically running for re-election.Musk's endorsement of Trump followed an assassination attempt against the former president in July, after which Musk publicly backed Trump's campaign. The tech billionaire has since donated tens of millions of dollars to Trump's re-election efforts. In return, Trump has promised to create a new government post tailored specifically for Musk: the 'secretary of cost-cutting,' reflecting Trump's admiration for Musk's business acumen and efficiency in reducing expenses.Musk's warning about a Harris-led government cracking down on free speech taps into a larger debate about content moderation and freedom of expression in the digital age. As social media platforms have come under increasing scrutiny for their role in amplifying disinformation, many have advocated for stricter regulations to curb harmful content. However, Musk and other free speech advocates argue that these efforts often go too far, stifling legitimate discourse and enabling government overreach.Should Harris win the presidency in November, the trajectory of her administration's approach to online speech will be closely watched. Her track record suggests that she will continue to advocate for increased regulation of tech platforms, particularly regarding misinformation and harmful content. However, as Musk pointed out, the question of who defines misinformation and who holds the power to regulate speech remains a contentious issue.In a political environment where free speech is increasingly at the forefront of national debates, the tension between protecting the public from harmful content and preserving open discourse will likely be a defining feature of the next administration, regardless of the outcome of the election. For Musk and his supporters, the stakes couldn't be higher, as they fear that a Harris presidency could mark the beginning of a new era of censorship in the United States.",

    "title": "Moldovan Diaspora in EU Shows Little Interest in Crucial Presidential Election and Referendum",
    "content": "The October 20, 2024, presidential election and referendum on European integration in Moldova, which was expected to draw significant participation from the large Moldovan diaspora, has so far witnessed a surprisingly low turnout in the European Union. With 228 polling stations established worldwide, many of them in the EU, the turnout in key cities suggests waning interest from Moldovan citizens abroad.Polling stations in major European cities, such as Barcelona and Paris, have been notably empty. Images from Barcelona show only the election commission members present, while a video from Paris shows just two voters casting their ballots in an otherwise deserted polling station. The situation is similar in Rostock, Germany, where only 70 people cast votes in the initial hours, with 17 of those being election officials themselves.The lack of voter engagement in the EU has raised questions about why the diaspora, which plays a crucial role in Moldovan politics, appears to have largely stayed away from this significant vote. The referendum on Moldova's European integration, in particular, was expected to attract interest given the importance of the issue for Moldova's future.While turnout in the EU has been minimal, the scene is entirely different in Russia. In Moscow, Moldovan citizens lined up outside polling stations in massive numbers, with queues stretching several hundred meters. Despite the cold weather, voters waited patiently to cast their ballots, and some reportedly travelled long distances to vote.The striking contrast in turnout between EU and Russian polling stations has led to discussions about the different political dynamics in these regions and how they may shape the outcome of the election and referendum.In addition to the low turnout in the EU, there have been reports of various violations at polling stations. In several European countries, including Italy, Germany, and Romania, representatives of presidential candidates were reportedly denied access to observe the voting process. Ion Chicu's campaign reported registering 103 observers, but only seven were allowed into foreign polling stations.Additionally, in several locations across Romania and the UK, voters were allegedly transported illegally to polling stations, a practice that violates election laws. In Verona, Italy, campaign leaflets were distributed to voters waiting in line, further fuelling concerns about electoral fairness.The Moldovan Central Election Commission's decision to deny international organisations observer status has compounded concerns about transparency. This decision has left the election and referendum vulnerable to allegations of misconduct, particularly in light of the reported irregularities across the EU.As the results come in, the discrepancies between voter turnout in the EU and Russia, as well as the reported violations, could have far-reaching implications for the election's legitimacy. With Moldova at a crossroads between European integration and other geopolitical influences, the stakes in this election and referendum are higher than ever.",

    "title": "'Blue Dot' in Nebraska draws boldface political names",
    "content": "PAPILLION, Neb. -- On an unseasonably warm October evening in eastern Nebraska on Saturday, with only 17 days until the 2024 presidential election, both the Harris and Trump campaigns descended upon the Cornhusker State to deliver a similar message to its 2nd Congressional District: their votes could singularly decide the outcome of the race.Nebraska is one of two states -- Maine is the other -- that doesn't award Electoral College votes on a winner-take-all basis. The winner of the popular vote in the state gets two votes and the other three are divided by the winner in each of the state's congressional districts.On Saturday, Democratic vice presidential nominee and Nebraska native son Tim Walz held a 1,400-person rally in the 2nd District -- the Democratic-leaning area around Omaha, or \"blue dot\" -- that could deliver the Kamala Harris-Walz ticket one decisive Electoral College vote, despite recent efforts from Donald Trump and other Republicans to make the historically red state switch to winner-take-all that would likely hand the former president all of the state's votes.\"And I have to tell you, I think all of you know this, this thing is going to be close... the 'Blue Wall' is going to hold across the north of America -- Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Minnesota,\" Walz said, indicating his confidence in winning those industrial states that proved critical in getting President Joe Biden across the 270 Electoral College vote threshold to win the presidency in 2020.\"But you do the math,\" Walz added, counting the states again. \"269 -- one dot makes a difference. Look -- 'Blue Dot,' you're inspiring the rest of the country.\"\"Omaha, put us over the top,\" Walz concluded his rally on Saturday.Across town, former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard campaigned for former President Donald Trump, also telling the crowd in the state's 2nd Congressional District just how influential their ballots could be in November.Kennedy alerted a different 1,400-person audience in a downtown Hilton ballroom that their district was voting in the \"most critical election in this country.\"\"We could still end up 269 to 269 ... Your votes are the most important votes in the United States today, and that's why we need to win that state,\" he said.The possibility that Trump and Harris tie at 269-269 -- where neither hits the 270 electoral votes required to win the presidency -- isn't out of the question in a race forecasted by pundits and pollsters to be close.On Saturday, Kennedy laid out a hypothetical election night scenario that he said was based on internal polling he conducted while he was a candidate, in which Harris wins Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and Trump wins North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada, and Arizona.In that scenario, there would be 269- 269 tie, he said. Kennedy highlighted then that one Electoral College vote in a state like Nebraska or Maine could push one candidate over the top.Gabbard encouraged the audience to \"convince\" other voters in the district to vote for Trump.\"You could be that swing district that will either save our country or continue us down this path towards darkness and destruction,\" she said. \"I want you to think about how close these elections can be, and this single congressional district in particular.\"\"So as you leave here tonight, I really hope you take the time to go through the contacts that you have in your phone or your Facebook friends or your coworkers, and seriously, go down name by name, and think about who you can reach out to, that you can maybe convince them about why they should vote for President Trump in this election,\" Gabbard added.According to the Harris campaign, it has been on the ground in the district for \"months,\" holding weekly phone banking and canvass events out of three field offices in Omaha. In the last four days, the campaign said 100 Harris for Nebraska volunteers have spoken to more than 6,400 voters in the district.\"We are, we're just like this tiny, little blue dot in this red state, we but we have a voice, and we want to be heard, and especially in this election, this election is so important,\" Meg Hawks, a Democrat from Omaha told ABC News at Walz's rally.\"The blue dot has made our city and our state even just such a joyful place, and we have,\" she said. \"I personally feel joyful about this, I feel joyful about Tim Walz coming from Nebraska, and joyful about Kamala Harris' policies.\"Nebraska has been a hot topic nationally many times this cycle -- first for the possibility it might change its Electoral College process into one more favorable to Trump and taking away power from the \"Blue Dot,\" and now for its increasingly competitive House and Senate races that could determine the balance of power in both chambers.There is no Democrat running for Senate in Nebraska but independent Dan Osborn is being quietly (and sometimes not so quietly) backed by the party over incumbent Republican Sen. Deb Fischer. Walz didn't mention the Senate race or its candidates at his rally on Saturday, but he did boost state Rep. Tony Vargas, who is running as a Democrat in the 2nd District.\"We're going to need a Congress that actually knows what work looks like for the American people -- send Tony Vargas there and put Democrats in charge,\" Walz said.At the Hilton, Kennedy and Gabbard did not once mention either the Senate or congressional races in the district. But Democratic attendees at Walz's rally on Saturday were buzzing about Senate race.\"I'm very cautiously optimistic that Dan Osborn will win. He's getting momentum and I think people are tired by what she has not done, she really doesn't have anything to show,\" said Monica Kruger, a rally attendee from Omaha.Judy Sterba, an Omahan who was also at the rally, said she was working hard to get both Vargas and Osborne to Washington.\"I have yard signs and I write postcards all over the country to get people to register to vote. So I'm giving money all the time to everybody. I think it's really important, and I really want Tony Vargas to win, and Dan Osborne. I like the candidate, and I really hate Deb for sure. So that's a really good reason for me,\" she said, noting that Senate control was \"absolutely\" a reason she was also supporting Osborn.\" got a real good shot, a real good shot,\" she said, noting his rapid rise over the past few months.\"I was at Jazz on the Green, which is a summer music festival, probably in like July. Somebody came around saying, 'Can you sign for Dan Osborne to get on the ballot?' I'm like, 'Seriously, this late?' This guy has a chance, and he's been working his ass off. He's got a ton of support,\" she said.",

    "content": "Sheesh! As Vice President Kamala Harris continues to claim that Donald Trump is \"becoming increasingly unstable and unhinged in real-time,\" the former president kicked off his recent Pennsylvania rally by going on a rant and rambling about the size of golfing legend Arnold Palmer's manhood.RELATED: Antonio Brown Praises Donald Trump And Slams Kamala Harris & 'Tampon Tim' Walz At Pennsylvania RallyWhile hosting a rally in Latrobe, Pennsylvania (about 40 miles east of Pittsburgh), former President Donald Trump began his rally by telling Pennsylvanians how much he loves them and then proceeded to ramble about the manhood of golfing legend Arnold Palmer, who passed in September 2016 at 87.Trump began his speech, \"Hello, everybody. Hello, Pennsylvania. We love Pennsylvania. And a very special hello to Latrobe. I love Latrobe, you know why? It's the home of Arnold Palmer. This is the home of my friend Arnold Palmer. And he loved Latrobe. You know, he turned out to be one of the greatest golfers in the world. He started off very, very poor. He had no money, just had a lot of talent and a lot of muscle. He was a strong guy.\"\"His father worked at Latrobe Golf Course. And he was a laborer there. Actually, they called him in those days, 'sod carriers.' He's a very strong man. He carried sod, they didn't have trucks then. They had strong people carrying sod. He was the strongest of them all and he had a son, but they had no money. He worked at Latrobe  and they treated him good because he could do more work than anybody else. His son started to grow up and he realized his son was very strong like him, but he'd never had a chance to play golf, he had no money at all.\"RELATED: Lizzo Speaks At Kamala Harris' Detroit Rally And Blasts Donald Trump's Recent Negative Comments About The City: 'I'm Proud To Be From This City'\"His son was named Arnold and when Arnold was four and five years old, they had no money to buy a club. He couldn't buy one club, not one.\" Before continuing, Trump went on to share that he learned all of this first-hand from Arnold Palmer and his father.He added, \"They used to go to the bag room where the members were and they took out members' clubs and they'd use the members' clubs, two or three of them at night, late at night, and he hit balls with his son. He'd watch his son's every move and he realized his son had great talent. Then, his son got older and stronger, and then he got stronger and stronger, and his father started saying, 'Wow, this is really crazy. What's going on with this kid?'\"Trump said, \"Finally, he was able to save up enough money to get him some clubs, but they weren't strong enough. Arnold was breaking them. He'd swing a regular club and it'd break the hell out of it because he was so powerful. They went back to the members' bags because they couldn't afford another set. They used very stiff-shafted clubs... very strong, for those of you that aren't golfers. He got better and better and he went to high school and won all sorts of championships.\"RELATED: Donald Trump Explains Why He Didn't Like Playing Football Growing UpDonald Trump continued to share the rest of Arnold Palmer's story, including meeting and partnering with Mark McCormack, and how Palmer became a legendary golfer. Trump made his way back to how he came to know Palmer personally and said, \"I got to know him when he was 69 years old. I played with him. As he got older, he started to lose distance. I'm a good golfer, but not like that. But, I felt so good because I was hitting it a little bit longer than Arnold, but he was, by this time, about 75 or 76. I'd hit it four or five yards past him.\"After several more minutes of rambling about Arnold Palmer's career and various excursions they took, Donald Trump told the crowd in Latrobe, \"He could not get enough of Latrobe. So, you know, I've been here before and I've told the story before, but not in this kind of detail... I wanted to tell the real story of Arnold Palmer.\"Trump continued to divulge, \"Arnold Palmer was all man and I say that in all due respect to women. I love women, but this guy. This guy... This is a guy that was all man. This man was strong and tough. I refused to say it, but when he took showers with the other Pros, they came out of there and they would say, 'Oh my God. That's unbelievable.' I had to say it. We have women that are highly sophisticated here. But they used to look at Arnold and say, 'Man.' But, he was really something special. Arnold was something special.\"RELATED: Watch: Donald Trump Tells Skeptical Republican Voter Jan. 6 Was A 'Day Of Love' -- Kamala Harris ReactsHe concluded, \"I just want to tell you, you're very lucky, the people that live in Latrobe. It's an honor for me to be here because of him. He was a great man and I don't think there would be golf, to the extent that you have it today, it probably wouldn't be that way without the great Arnold Palmer. So, enjoy it, everybody. Enjoy it. And I had to tell you the shower part of it because it's true. We want to be honest and upfront. It's true.\"Donald Trump's comments about the size of Arnold Palmer's manhood arrive on the heels of his 2024 presidential election opponent Kamala Harris claiming he is \"becoming increasingly unstable and unhinged.\" In a new 30-second campaign ad, VP Harris describes Trump being \"unhinged, unstable, and unchecked\" as of late.This doesn't appear to be too far off as Trump not only rambles about another man's manhood size but as he recently told voters to cast their ballots on January 5th and as he recently closed a campaign rally with 40 minutes of music playing with him standing and swaying on stage.#Socialites, be sure to check out the post below, then leave us your thoughts in a comment after!",

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}People can't get enough of betting on the 2024 presidential election, and thanks to a recent legal ruling, it's easier than ever for Americans to vote with their wallet.On Polymarket, one of the top online exchanges, people have already spent over $1.2 bn betting on the US presidential election. That includes two mystery individuals betting millions on a Trump win.Betting market odds are suddenly on the lips of US broadcasters and campaign spin doctors, quoted like polls and watched like the weather.Betting on elections has long been prohibited in the US, but various exchanges and their users have found ways to get in on the action nonetheless.A federal appeals court ruled earlier on October 2 that prediction market Kalshi could offer contracts on US elections for the time being, leading to more than $3m in political contracts within the first week. Federal regulators at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which concluded last year such contracts run afoul of commodities law, argue this activity still amounts to illegal gaming or gambling, and are seeking further appeals hearings as soon as December.With the legal status of betting inside of the US still up for debate, one popular way to put money down on the presidential race is to operate outside of America.Eva, a software developer from the Netherlands, told The Independent she's been betting since before the 2020 election. She first got into it during her time as a semi-professional poker player, and is drawn to political betting both for fun and because it's \"profitable.\" People often bet based on their partisan politics, giving an edge to those who trade on probability alone.She thinks Trump is \"somewhat dangerous for democracy,\" but she immediately put money down on the Republican after Biden was inaugurated, given the \"crazy\" 15-to-1 odds being offered on a Trump comeback at the time. She appreciates political betting because of the way it clarifies your thinking, forcing you to deal in likelihoods and probabilities instead of thoughts and feelings.\"I think if more people put their money where their mouths were when it comes to politics, we'd probably be living in a more realistic and less partisan world,\" she said via email, adding, \"I feel like people could use some grounding.\"Another online better, a Bulgarian political analyst based in Germany, told The Independent he only got into the action a few weeks ago, putting 150 euro on Harris, as Trump has \"too much of an extreme game\" to win over enough voters. He thinks most people should probably stay away from betting though.\"I do not recommend political or any type of betting to anyone,\" he said. \"It is largely like casinos where the house has the edge and most if not all people end up losing on the long run. It is a very dangerous enterprise.\"\"If you are good with risks and money and can be disciplined enough and do develop an edge, the potential returns might be worth it but that's if you tick all of the above boxes which is almost never the case,\" he added.Among the most popular, and oft-referenced, platforms is Polymarket, founded in 2020. The site allows users outside the US to bet in crypto on the outcome of future events, including the presidential election, and features a video game-like leaderboard showing top traders and what's in their wallet. Reporting suggests that despite it violating the site's terms of service, plenty of Americans are using the site anyway via VPNs.It may play like a game, but Polymarket is backed by some serious names, including like right-wing Silicon Valley venture capitalist Peter Thiel, whose firm was the lead investor on a recent $70m funding round, and elections guru Nate Silver, who serves as an adviser to the company.Regardless of where it's drawing its bets from, Polymarket has emerged as a kind of shorthand for the market outlook on the US election overall, frequently quoted on Elon Musk's X feed and cable news discussions.Musk tweeted earlier this month that Polymarket's preference for Trump -- currently around 62-38 for Trump -- is more reliable than the traditional election research showing him behind Harris, since \"actual money is on the line.\"On the other side of the spectrum are prediction markets like PredictIt, run out of New Zealand's Victoria University, and the University of Iowa's Iowa Electronic Markets, both of which avoid legal scrutiny by being run as academic projects rather than commercial ones.Researchers say there are a variety of reasons why betting markets aren't like polls -- which is a good thing.\"It's not who do you want to have win, but what do you think is going to happen. It's a different question,\" John Phillips, co-founder and CEO of PredictIt, told The Independent.Not to be ignored, added Phillips, is that political betting markets are fun, not a word traditionally used to describe following the ups and downs of national politics. Moreover, betting may seem like a little game, but to do it well, you need to be basing your moves on solid information and quality news.\"That's a good thing for democracy,\" he said. \"People who might be disengaged become engaged.\"Dr. Grant Ferguson, of the Texas Christian University political science department, told The Independent such markets pick up moment-to-moment changes in feeling and information that might not make it into polls until days later.\"They can react in real time,\" he said. \"If you wanna follow the odds for a particular candidate winning a state, you can watch how the market moves one way or the other during a debate. Sometimes that can have an effect. What that means is, the people who bet in these markets are able to incorporate a lot more information than just polling.\"Particularly interesting are moments where the markets and the polls diverge slightly, such as the one we find ourselves in now. Polymarket is bullish on Trump, while our poll tracker still finds Harris in the lead. According to Ferguson, the markets were also more bullish on Trump than the polling in 2016, an election which he won in a shock upset.But this didn't start with Trump -- big money election betting has a long, semi-illicit, semi-legitimate history in the US, dating back to the days of Washington, sometimes eclipsing volume on financial markets themselves.\"Crowds formed in the financial district - on the Curb  or in the lobby of the New York Stock Exchange -- and brokers would call out bid and ask odds as if trading securities,\" scholars Paul W. Rhode and Koleman S. Strumpf write in a paper on the subject. \"In presidential races such as 1896, 1900, 1904, 1916, and 1924, the New York Times, Sun, and World provided nearly daily quotes from early October until Election Day.\"Despite their unique structure and engaged fanbase, political betting markets have plenty of caveats and detractors beyond just the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Last year, a group of Democratic senators including Elizabeth Warren warned in a letter to regulators that markets like Kalshi and Polymarket pose a \"clear threat to our democracy.\"\"For example, billionaires could expand their already outsized influence on politics by wagering extraordinary bets while simultaneously contributing to a specific candidate or party,\" the letter reads.And like the world of political \"dark money,\" election markets are basically anonymous, with big spenders visible only by a screenname, if that. The top trader on this month's Polymarket leaderboard is a user named Fredi9999, who has made over $1.9m, largely in bets on Donald Trump.Others worry about issues found on regular financial markets: insider trading, irrational runs, high-spending \"whales\" who shift the markets all on their own.Moreover, there's the prospect that the kind of person who uses a political betting market -- highly online, with money to blow, possibly in crypto -- might have baked in biases, just like any other sub-group. That could skew the predictive value of what their trades represent, but the Trump campaign seems to see this in-group as an upside.It has been aggressively courting the online crypto-tech-finance bro nexus, with the Trump campaign hosting fundraisers in Silicon Valley, recruiting a venture capitalist as his running mate, and throwing his support behind a crypto \"digital real estate\" project called World Liberty Financial. Only a few weeks left to see if the bet pays off.",

    "content": "An open letter calling on activists and organisations in Aotearoa and so-called 'Australia' hosting talks with Vijay Prashad, to rescind or cancel his invitations to these events. Explains the objections to Prashad's politics both briefly & in detail.This is an open letter calling on activists and organisations in Aotearoa and so-called 'Australia' hosting talks with Vijay Prashad, to rescind or cancel his invitations to these events.It has been recently announced that there will be a public discussion held at the University of Auckland with Prashad on Thursday 24th October, and a Palestine Solidarity Network Aotearoa event in conversation with Prashad later that evening also in Auckland. Prashad is scheduled to speak on a livestream for the New Zealand Fabian Society on the evening of Friday 25th October. He is also scheduled to speak at the New Zealand Federation of Socialist Societies National Conference in Wellington on Sunday 27 October. The Red Ant Collective will be hosting Prashad on his Australia Tour between October 29 and November 7, at various venues in Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne and Perth.We are a network of socialist and leftist organisers united by a conviction that workers' self-emancipation, anti-imperialism, decolonisation, anti-authoritarianism, internationalism and feminism are integral parts of a socialist politics for the 21st century. We are alarmed by the growing influence of US-centred campist politics spreading on the left. Vijay Prashad is one of the main public intellectuals spreading this ideology.Prashad has a well-documented history of supporting non-Western imperialist and settler colonial projects, including outright denial of and apologism for the Chinese government's Uyghur genocide, the Ethiopian government's Tigrayan genocide, and the Sri Lankan government's Tamil genocide. He has also infamously attempted to cover up a political party's involvement in the rape and murder of an Indian woman activist. This is a racist and violent politics that is painfully hypocritical in its double standards of who is deserving or undeserving of internationalist solidarity.While we are all actively opposed to US imperialism, we are not willing to sacrifice Indigenous and other racialised struggles for liberation or independence from non-western imperialism, authoritarianism, and settler colonialism. We call on socialists in Aotearoa and so-called Australia to not collaborate with or provide platforms for Prashad, and either rescind his invitation to any events that have been organised, or cancel the events.Platforming genocide denialists in the name of Palestine undermines the Palestinian struggle, and undermines the claims of socialism and the left to stand for the international liberation of all working people.Those of us on the left whose non-Western homelands and peoples have been subjected to the dictatorships, genocides, colonisation and repression that Prashad denies and minimises, make a special plea to the socialist communities of Aotearoa and so-called 'Australia' to recognise our humanity, agency, lived experiences and expertise in this area.Signed,People Against All ImperialismsAuckland Peace ActionCripps Contra ColonialismFightback (Aotearoa/Australia)Free Palestine Coalition NaarmNew Bloom (Taiwan)Peace Action WellingtonSahabat (Aotearoa)Uyghur Solidarity AotearoaARC UP Anarchist Communists (Naarm/Melbourne)Anonymous Signatory 1*Anonymous Signatory 2*Rafiqah AbdullahNabilah Husna Abdul RahmanJuniper BevenseeScheherazade BloulHannah BlumhardtSina Brown-DavisRākau BuchananLouise Sang Cheung BurlingAnne CampbellTāwhana ChadwickJade ChoByron ClarkHera CookLaura Lavinia DrewBeverly FletcherMihingarangi ForbesChristopher FungPip GrimshawMarty HMandy HagerMandy HenkGayaal IddamalgodaA.S.

If you wish to remain anonymous due to homeland country security concerns, please state this.See below for more information:Prashad has a history of supporting non-Western settler colonial projects, genocide denialism and apologism. For example:He is also a misogynist:Apologism for the Communist Party of India (Marxist)Vijay Prashad is a well-known Marxist historian, author and journalist. He is the author of histories of the Non-Aligned Movement in his book \"The Darker Nations\" and the New International Economic Order and the IMF Structural Adjustment Programmes in his book \"The Poorer Nations\". He is the editor of LeftWord Books, Chief Correspondent at Globetrotter and is also the director of the Tricontinental Institute for Social Research who state their goal is to \"build a bridge between academic production and political and social movements in order to promote critical thinking and stimulate debates and research with an emancipatory perspective that serves the people's aspirations.\" Prashad is a senior non-resident fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies of the Renmin University of China.Denial of genocide in \"Xinjiang\"/East TurkestanAmongst other harmful discourses and actions, Prashad repeats Chinese government propaganda and talking points which ultimately undermines decolonization. He has been on record saying that what is happening in \"Xinjiang\" to Uyghurs, Khazaks and other Muslim Indigenous peoples occupied by China as 'poverty alleviation', and later re-justified this genocide implying it is \"a people's project that struggles to find a way to undermine social hierarchies and advance the possibilities for the people\". Prashad seems to consider the mass incarceration, torture, forced assimilation, forced labour, separation of families and children, the erasure of Uyghur culture and sterilisaton of Uyghur women as such a project.The use of Marxist and anti-imperialist language to justify such colonial violence, we see as a form of redwashing of genocide. This is a cynical strategy that Zionists have used against Palestinians. Likewise, the Chinese government has heavily borrowed from Israel and US discourses on the 'war on terror' to cast an Indigenous Muslim population fighting for independence as 'terrorism'. Not only has discourse and ideology been borrowed from Western and Zionist propaganda, China is also materially and in terms of its security policies linked within the larger Western-led Islamophobic 'war on terror'. For example, China engaged the infamous Christian-supremacist Erik Prince's Frontier Services Group for both the Belt and Road Initiative and in relation to the Uyghur concentration camps in Xinjiang, with Prince being the former head of the infamous US private military contractor Blackwater which committed war crimes in Iraq.This pro-CCP stance also exists in a context of funding from 'Maoist' millionaire Neville Roy Singham to the Tricontinental Institute through the Goldman Sachs Philanthropy Fund. It is no secret that Singham has business interests in China and has actively funded the spread of pro-CCP talking points through The People's Forum, and BreakThrough News, and through Indian media.Support for the Ethiopian government's genocidal war in Tigray and Sahel military dictatorshipsIn addition, Prashad has repeatedly defended the Ethiopian government and worked with both Ethiopian government officials and pro-government diasporic grounds toward that end, with him claiming that it is being subject to hybrid warfare at the hands of American imperialism. Prashad did this in an event with a representative of the Ethiopian government and an Ethiopian diaspora organisation, both of which espoused the Ethiopian government's position, which denies they engaged in a genocide against the Tigrayans and framed their genocide as a counter-terrorism operation against Tigrayan rebels. Such claims ignore that the Ethiopian government since 2020 has been engaging in a genocide against the Tigrayan people in order to restore Amhara supremacy over the other nationalities in Ethiopia as it existed under the Ethiopian Empire. This genocide denial is in direct contradiction to any claim to oppose genocide as part of an emancipatory politics.Prashad's support for reactionary regimes in Africa does not stop with Ethiopia, with Prashad also praising the Alliance of Sahel States, which is made up of the military juntas that rule Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. Prashad supports the alliance on the basis that they oppose French neo-colonialism in Africa and they are putting the three countries on the path to genuine independence. Such a sanguine position on the Sahel military juntas is flawed for three reasons. First, supporting military dictatorship is a complete negation of a foundational principle for socialists, which is that the emancipation of the workers, peasants and the oppressed must be conquered by the workers, peasants and the oppressed themselves. Second, military dictatorships historically and today implement extremely reactionary policies that are anti-worker, anti-peasant, anti-LGBT+, anti-ethnic and religious minorities etc. with the military junta in Burkina Faso recently criminalising homosexuality. Third, the alliance has built ties and strong geopolitical, military and economic dependency with the far-right Russian government that is engaging in a settler colonial invasion of Ukraine, showing how the Sahel has traded French neo-colonialism for Russian neo-colonialism. Given this, Prashad's support for these military dictatorships is a total abandonment of the principles of workers self-emancipation and of decolonisation.Support for the Tamil genocide-denying People's Liberation Front/JVPPrashad has also publicly celebrated the leader of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna/People's Liberation Front (JVP) party Anura Kumara Dissanayanke's victory during the Sri Lankan 2024 presidential election. The JVP are known for their oppression of Tamils in Sri Lanka and the Sinhala supremacy that the party espouses. More specifically, Anura and the JVP supported the Sri Lankan military during their genocide against the Tamils, opposed every international investigation into the Tamil genocide as well as any attempt to hold the genocidaires accountable and opposed the implementation of the 13th Amendment of the Sri Lankan constitution that grants political devolution to Tamils during and after the genocide. Sri Lanka is an ethnocracy, the JVP even cosied up to the most overtly fascist Buddhist clergy to win the election. This is similar to how Israel feigns liberalism and even socialism while genociding. Such support for genocide, opposition to any accountability measures and a refusal to support political autonomy and policies that reduce racial, national and ethnic discrimination are in flagrant contradiction to socialist principles and conceptions of internationalism, anti-imperialism and decolonisation.Denial of gendered violence in the Communist Party of India (Marxist)/CPI(M)When Prashad is not engaging in genocide denial and supporting military dictatorships, he is busy denying that members of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) engaged in gender violence against women. More specifically, in 2007, Vijay Prashad denied that Tapasi Malik, an activist who was struggling against the expropriation of land in Singur, West Bengal from locals against Tata -- India's largest conglomerate -- trying to establish an auto factory there with the backing of the CPI(M), was raped, burned and murdered by CPI(M) members, with Prashad instead claiming that Tapasi's father and brother did this. In reality, subsequent arrests and court trials revealed that two CPI(M) members were behind such horrific gender violence.Prashad himself was born and lived his childhood in Kolkata, West Bengal in India. His aunt is Brinda Karat, a prominent CPI(M) member, who was elected to the Politburo of the CPI(M) which is the highest leadership body within the Party in 2005. The targeted campaign of harassment resulting in the rape and murder of Tapasi was ordered by a powerful local CPI(M) West Bengal leader Suhrid Datta, at the time the Singur Zonal Committee Secretary of the CPI(M). It is unlikely that the CPI(M) leadership, especially the CPI(M) West Bengal leadership -- would not have been familiar at least with the controversies around Tapasi's death and the circumstances around their land expropriation campaign in Singur, West Bengal. Prashad's spreading of falsehoods around Tapasi's rape and murder is one of many examples globally of sexism and rape culture within Marxist parties and mileus, starkly demonstrates why any revolutionary socialism today must be feminist.What is \"campism\"?Campism is the position that the world is divided into competing groups of nation-states (or camps) and that socialists should support one of the camps in order to promote the growth and development of socialism. Campism arose during the inter-imperialist First World War, where socialists, be they anarchists or Marxists, became divided over whether they should support the Allied/Entente Powers (led by Britain, France, Russia and the United States of America), the Central Powers (led by Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire) or oppose both camps and organise to transform the inter-imperialist world war into a civil war and then a world revolution. In the lead up to and during the Second World War, socialists were split based on whether to support the anti-fascist Allies (led by Britain, France, the USA and the Soviet Union) or oppose them as well as the fascist Axis (led by Nazi Germany, fascist Italy and the Japanese Empire) and organise for a world revolution.This was then followed by the Cold War, where there was the Western bloc (the capitalist countries led by the United States), the Eastern bloc (the Soviet-type societies led by the Soviet Union) and non-aligned countries, with different socialist tendencies either supporting the Eastern bloc, the non-aligned countries or opposing both of these as well as the Western bloc and instead develop a revolutionary socialist camp. With the end of the Cold War, new camps have arisen, consisting of the Euro-American bloc led by the USA, a non-Western bloc led by Russia and China as well as non-aligned countries, with a major debate among socialists today being whether to support the non-Western bloc or non-aligned countries or to oppose all capitalist camps and instead focus on building an internationalist, anti-imperialist and decolonial socialist movement.Vijay Prashad and CampismVijay Prashad is a campist of the contemporary non-Western bloc. More specifically, Prashad is a tankie, a term that was coined by dissident British Marxists to describe those members of the Communist Party of Great Britain that supported the Soviet Union suppressing the 1956 Hungarian Revolution with tanks. Since it was coined in the late 1950's, the term tankie expanded to describe those who supported the Soviet-type societies throughout the Cold War. After the Cold War, the term tankie has changed in meaning, with it these days referring to those who support the five states that claim to be socialist and have Marxist-Leninism as their state ideology (China, Vietnam, Cuba, North Korea and Laos) as well as their allies who claim to be anti-imperialist (such as Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Syria etc.).What is campist ideology?Campist ideology is based on both misinformation and a politics that denies the agency of any other imperialism outside of the West. The misinformation and fantasy is the notion that any state that calls itself 'socialist' or 'communist' is a socialist/communist country when in reality, they can be forms of state capitalism where workers have little power. It is a racist ideology that leads to justifications of state violence against dissidents, in the case of China of the Uyghur genocide either as necessary to 'eliminate poverty', or as all CIA propaganda to fuel a Cold War with China. It is couched in 'Marxist' and 'anti-imperialist' language that denies the realities on the ground, presenting a black and white, good vs evil narrative.In regards to China, Sino-Russian campists see anything anti-China as Sinophobic and pro-US, even when the critiques come from socialists, anarchists, and Chinese dissidents. While their analysis and opposition to US imperialism is well-justified, it transitions in apologism or direct promotion of Chinese state policies and propaganda that allow for oppression, imperialism, settler colonialism and genocide. In effect, that gaslight those with lived experiences of genocide and Chinese state violence by denying it altogether or justifying it. It reflects a limited political imagination to go beyond both superpowers and make the connections that their oppressive tactics are actually entangled and uphold each other.Issues with campismMore broadly, there are multiple issues with campism. First, by arguing that certain capitalist states are imperialist, it ignores how there are other forms of imperialism such as the Russian and Chinese capitalist states.Second, it centers states in its analysis, tactics and strategy, more specifically which state blocs to support or oppose. Such a centering of states completely disregards some elemental socialist analysis and principles, more specifically that states exist to reproduce the world system through ideological, repressive and other means' that a socialist society that will genuinely bring about emancipation must be stateless; and that the only agents who have the interest in and the capacity to build such a society through revolution is the global working-class and peasantry.Third, by focusing on states as the main actors with agency in the realm of international politics, it leads to the dehumanisation of the workers and peasants that live under those states. This is because by ascribing agency only to states, those populations living under such states are seen as incapable of achieving anything or deserving any better than what they current have under the states they live by, which feeds into racist stereotypes, particular around non-Western peoples living under non-Western states. This is illustrated through the racism against Uyghurs, Tibetans, Tigrayans, Tamils and other peoples living under non-Western states espoused by Sino-Russian campists.Fourth, by dividing the world into competing blocs of capitalist states, it results in selective solidarity towards certain peoples based on if they are working with or struggling against states that are part of one camp or the other. It even obscures the ways in which states in this so-called anti-Western camp have helped suppress movements for liberation in ways inconsistent with tankies' own support of socialist movements. This can be seen in numerous examples such as China's support for Pakistan's genocidal war against Bangladesh's independence in 1971, China's support to Pinochet's dictatorship in Chile through loans, China's support for the Western-backed right-wing anti-communist UNITA in the Angolan Civil War, China's invasion of Vietnam in support of the US-backed Khmer Rouge regime -- and with other tankie-supported non-socialist regimes like Iran's suppression after the 1979 Revolution of the shoras workers' committees, the Fedaʾiyan-e Khalq and the Mujahideen-e Khalq and the workers' and women's liberation movement, and with the Asaad regime in Syria's repression against leftists, the workers' movement and intervention in favour of right-wing forces in the Lebanese Civil War, and much more. More broadly, both China and Russia -- diplomatic gestures otherwise -- are extensively imbricated in the Western-led imperialist world order in their own ways, with China and Russia engaging in security technologies, arms trade and cooperation with Israel (such as HikVision's use in the Palestinian West Bank), Indonesia (in relation to Indonesia's occupation of Timor Leste before its independence and West Papua), the Myanmar military junta, and much more.Fifth, as a result of the previous point, campism leads to the limitation of our collective power. This is because support for any capitalist camp's actions and denial of the genocide and settler colonialism that they are engaging in leads to the workers and peasants that are part of the communities that are being subjected to both by any of the capitalist camps being alienated by socialists who hold such positions. As a result, they lose interest in socialism, which makes the pivotal task of building a revolutionary socialist movement amongst the workers and peasants of the world even more difficulty than it already is.For the above reasons, it is pivotal that socialists reject campism in all its forms and recommit themselves to developing the theory and practice of an anti-imperialist, decolonial and internationalist revolutionary socialism so that we can bring about the emancipation of the workers and peasants of the world once and for all.On the basis of Prashad's genocide denial, support for settler colonialism and misogyny, we call on socialists in Aotearoa and so-called Australia to not collaborate with or platform Prashad, and cancel any events that have been organised with Prashad as a speaker. We are ultimately doing so because we argue that Prashad's campism, genocide denial, apologetics for settler colonialism and misogyny is contributing to the liquidation of the decolonial, anti-imperialist and feminist principles that are an integral part of contemporary socialist theory and practice. If this is allowed to happen, then this will result in a socialism that cannot successfully bring about a social revolution that will genuinely bring about the emancipation of the workers of the world in their entirety. Instead, it will deradicalise socialism to such an extent that it will at most be a movement to reform the world system, as happened to the workers parties of the Second International in the early 20th century. In the context of the ongoing genocides, femicides and ecocides that are happening across the entirety of the world system, this must not be allowed to happen to socialism, as it has been repeatedly proven that this system's problems cannot be solved through reform. Instead, it is incumbent on all of us to help construct a principled internationalist, anti-imperialist and feminist socialism that will bring about intersectional workers emancipation, with rejecting genocide deniers, settler colonial apologists and misogynists like Prashad being part of that process of construction.As people that are committed to a liberatory politics, revolutionary socialism and decolonisation our actions and the people that we collaborate with and platform speak for who we are. Giving a platform to someone who denies and engages in apologism for imperialism committed by non-Western powers goes against a principled approach to our politics. It denies the ways in which power structures shapeshift and borrow from each other, adopting different 'faces' with the similar supremacist and violent ideologies that undergird them. There is one world-system of capitalism, imperialism, statism, settler-colonialism and cisheteropatriarchy -- and defending or apologising for any part of it, failing to uphold or be in solidarity with the exploited or oppressed anywhere and everywhere will be an obstacle against our struggle for a world liberated from oppression and exploitation.",

    "title": "Judges punishing Jan. 6 rioters say they fear more political violence as Election Day nears",
    "content": "WASHINGTON -- Over the past four years, judges at Washington's federal courthouse have punished hundreds of rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol in an unprecedented assault on the nation's democracy. On the cusp of the next presidential election, some of those judges fear another burst of political violence could be coming.Before recently sentencing a rioter to prison, U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton said he prays Americans accept the outcome of next month's election. But the veteran judge expressed concern that Donald Trump and his allies are spreading the same sort of conspiracy theories that fueled the mob's Jan. 6, 2021, riot.\"That sore loser is saying the same things he said before,\" Walton said earlier this month without mentioning the Republican presidential nominee by name. \"He's riling up the troops again, so if he doesn't get what he wants, it's not inconceivable that we will experience that same situation again. And who knows? It could be worse.\"MORE: Scott Perry voted absentee while serving abroad. Now, he's challenging military votingMORE: Donald Trump holds town hall in Lancaster today as campaign hits home stretchMORE: Trump kicks off a Pennsylvania rally by talking about Arnold Palmer's genitaliaWalton, a nominee of President George W. Bush, is not alone. Other judges have said the political climate is ripe for another attack like the one injured more than 100 police officers at the Capitol. As Election Day nears, judges are frequently stressing the need to send a message beyond their courtrooms that political violence can't be tolerated.\"It scares me to think about what will happen if anyone on either side is not happy with the results of the election,\" Judge Jia Cobb, a nominee of President Joe Biden, said during a sentencing hearing last month for four Capitol rioters.Judge Rudolph Contreras lamented the potential for more politically motivated violence as he sentenced a Colorado man, Jeffrey Sabol, who helped other rioters drag a police officer into the mob. Sabol later told FBI agents that a \"call to battle was announced\" and that he had \"answered the call because he was a patriot warrior.\"\"It doesn't take much imagination to imagine a similar call coming out in the coming months, and the court would be concerned that Mr. Sabol would answer that call in the same way,\" Contreras, a President Barack Obama nominee, said in March before sentencing Sabol to more than five years in prison.Cornerstone of Trump campaignTrump's distortion of the Jan. 6 attack has been a cornerstone of his bid to reclaim the White House. The former president has denied any responsibility for the crimes of supporters who smashed windows, assaulted police officers and sent lawmakers running into hiding as they met to certify President Joe Biden's 2020 victory.Trump has vowed to pardon rioters, whom he calls \"patriots\" and \"hostages,\" if he wins in November. And he said he would accept the results of the upcoming election only if it's \"free and fair,\" casting doubts reminiscent of his baseless claims in 2020.Judges have repeatedly used their platform on the bench to denounce those efforts to downplay the violence on Jan. 6 and cast the rioters as political prisoners. And some have raised concerns about what such rhetoric means for the future of the country and its democracy.\"We're in a real difficult time in our country, and I hope we can survive it,\" Walton said this month while sentencing a Tennessee nurse who used a pair of medical scissors to smash a glass door at the Capitol.\"I've got a young daughter, I've got a young grandson, and I would like for America to be available to them and be as good to them as it has been to me,\" he added. \"But I don't know if we survive with the mentality that took place that day.\"1,500 charged, few show remorseMore than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes related to Jan. 6 siege, which disrupted the peaceful transfer of presidential power for the first time in the nation's history. Over 1,000 rioters have been convicted and sentenced. Roughly 650 of them received prison time ranging from a few days to 22 years.Justice Department prosecutors have argued in many cases that a prison sentence is necessary to deter convicted Capitol rioters from engaging in more politically motivated violence.\"With the 2024 presidential election approaching and many loud voices in the media and online continuing to sow discord and distrust, the potential for a repeat of January 6 looms ominously,\" prosecutors have repeatedly warned in court filings.MORE: Prosecutors lay out new evidence in Trump election case, say he 'resorted to crimes'MORE: Trump repeats false claims over 2020 election loss, deflects responsibility for Jan. 6MORE: Pennsylvania man, brother charged with assaulting New York Times photographer during Capitol riotMORE: Key passages from prosecutors' latest court filing in Trump caseMORE: Capitol rioter mistakenly released from prison after appeals court ruling, prosecutors sayProsecutors argue that defendants who have shown little or no remorse for their actions on Jan. 6 could break the law again. Some rioters even seem to be proud of their crimes.The first rioter to enter the Capitol texted his mother, \"I'll go again given the opportunity.\" A man from Washington state who stormed the Capitol with fellow Proud Boys extremist group members told a judge, \"You can give me 100 years and I'd do it all over again.\" A Kentucky nurse who joined the riot told a television interviewer that she would \"do it again tomorrow.\"A Colorado woman known to her social media followers as the \"J6 praying grandma\" avoided a prison sentence in August when a magistrate judge sentenced her for disorderly conduct and trespassing on Capitol grounds. Rebecca Lavrenz told the judge that God, not Trump, led her to Washington on Jan. 6.\"And she has all but promised to do it all over again,\" said prosecutor Terence Parker.Prosecutors had sought 10 months behind bars. After her April trial conviction, Lavrenz went on a \"media blitz\" to defend the mob, spread misinformation, undermine confidence in the courts and boost her celebrity in a community that believes Jan. 6 \"was a good day for this country,\" Parker said.Magistrate Zia Faruqui sentenced Lavrenz to six months of home confinement and fined her $103,000, stressing the need to \"lower the volume\" before the next election.\"These outside influences, the people that are tearing our country apart, they're not going to help you,\" Faruqui told her.",

    "content": "Donald Trump's running mate JD Vance came to prominence as the author of the sociopolitical family memoir Hillbilly Elegy. Here's a guide to his roots and the family he built with wife Usha Vance.If you knew anything about JD Vance before Donald Trump picked him to be his running mate in the 2024 presidential election, it's that he was raised by his tough-as-nails Mamaw.Which, as the junior senator from Ohio first detailed in his 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy, was what he called his impressively foul-mouthed maternal grandmother, Bonnie Eloise Blanton Vance. She took in JD and his older half-sister Lindsay when their mom Beverly couldn't provide a stable home.\"Mamaw was in so many ways a woman of contradictions,\" the 40-year-old said at the Republican National Convention in July while formally accepting his party's nomination for vice president. \"She loved the Lord, ladies and gentleman. She was a woman of very deep Christian faith. But she also loved the F-word. I'm not kidding. She could make a sailor blush.\"Hillbilly Elegy -- which in addition to telling his family's story is a treatise on why rural, working-class communities like the one his Mamaw hailed from have been feeling left behind -- put JD on the map as an in-demand commentator on socioeconomic issues and political grievances during the 2016 presidential election.And the book itself sprang from a discussion group on \"social decline in white America\" that he and his then-girlfriend (now wife) Usha Chilukuri organized in 2013 when they were students at Yale Law School.\"I'm one of those guys who really benefits from having sort of a powerful female voice over his left shoulder saying, \"Don't do that, do that,'\" JD said on Megyn Kelly's podcast in 2020. Growing up, that was Mamaw's voice, but now, he added, \"it's Usha.\"In his book he also credited his wife for encouraging him \"to seek opportunities that I didn't know existed.\"And now, after only a few years in politics -- having just been elected to the U.S. Senate in November 2022 -- the father of three could end up one rung away from the presidency.If you have any stories or news that you would like to share with the global online community, please feel free to share it with us by contacting us directly at",

    "title": "Mortgage Rates Rise to 6.44%, Yet 'Buyers May Be Feeling Ready To Act'",
    "content": "Mortgage rates rose from 6.32% last week to 6.44% for a 30-year fixed home loan for the week ending Oct. 17, according to Freddie Mac.\"The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased for the third consecutive week, moving closer to 6.5%,\" Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist, said in a statement. \"In general, higher rates reflect the strength in the economy that is supportive of the housing market. But notably, as compared to a year ago, rates are more than one percentage point lower and potential homebuyers can stand to benefit, especially by shopping around for the best quote as rates can vary widely between mortgage lenders.\"This wasn't exactly the news homebuyers were hoping for.\"While we expect the long-run trend in mortgage rates to be downward, recent weeks have brought volatility,\" explains Realtor.com® senior economist Ralph McLaughlin. This repetitive seesaw pattern could last until the last week of the month.Even so, October remains the best time to buy in many markets.\"Homebuyers should make buying decisions on finding the home that best meets their current and future needs, not on the short-term volatility in mortgage rates,\" advises McLaughlin.What else do these rate fluctuations mean for the fall and winter markets? Here's a snapshot of the latest housing market data and what it means for homebuyers and sellers in the latest installment of our \"Weekly Housing Market Update.\"Many people expected mortgage rates to take a major nosedive after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates last month for the first time since 2020 -- but that drastic free fall hasn't materialized.\"In general, the housing market has carried on without any major shifts in recent months, despite falling mortgage rates,\" says Realtor.com senior economic data analyst Hannah Jones in a recent report.Most outstanding mortgages have a 6% or lower rate, which creates a \"lock-in effect\" for many current owners who don't want to swap a low rate for a higher one. This could limit homeowners' willingness to sell, slowing or stalling the housing market.The fast-approaching 2024 presidential election might also be giving buyers and sellers pause as they wait for the political dust to settle.Mortgages may be on a constant roller coaster as of late, yet home prices remain stagnant.The median list price didn't rise or fall for the week ending Oct. 12 compared with the same time last year, remaining unchanged at 0.0%.This was the 20th week in a row that the median list price was less than or equal to what it was at the same time last year. (The median-priced home cost $425,000 in September.)Meanwhile, \"sellers continue to adjust prices to encourage home shopper attention,\" says Jones.Indeed, the share of listings with price reductions increased to 18.6% in September -- a 0.9 percentage point gain over the previous year.Despite uncertainties in the market, many sellers are listing their homes.Over the past few weeks, the number of active listings has stabilized, \"suggesting buyer activity could be starting to keep up,\" says Jones.The total number of homes for sale during the week ending Oct. 12 was strong, up 29.7% higher than the previous year. This marks 49 weeks in a row that the number of listings exceeded the previous year's levels.However, fresh listings seem to have fallen annually last week after spiking 8% only a week before. The decrease was partly due to Hurricane Milton, which halted new listing activity in many areas, making exact data collection impossible.More houses to choose from means buyers are taking their time making an offer. As a result, homes lingered on the market for eight days longer during the week ending Oct. 12 than they did at the same time last year. (The typical home spent 55 days on the market in September.)\"Generally, buyers have been holding off, waiting for more affordable housing conditions,\" says Jones.However, with more options available, Jones notes that \"still-keen buyers may be feeling ready to act before winter.\"If homebuyers do choose to get off the sidelines, they'll enjoy various benefits, including reduced competition.\"We encourage buyers to forget about mortgage rates and focus on taking advantage of a slower moving market, increasing price cuts, and inventory levels not seen in years,\" says McLaughlin.",

    "title": "'I hope we can survive it': Judges punishing Jan. 6 rioters fear post-election violence",
    "content": "WASHINGTON -- Over the past four years, judges at Washington's federal courthouse have punished hundreds of rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol in an unprecedented assault on the nation's democracy. On the cusp of the next presidential election, some of those judges fear another burst of political violence could be coming.Before recently sentencing a rioter to prison, U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton said he prays Americans accept the outcome of next month's election. But the veteran judge expressed concern that Donald Trump and his allies are spreading the same sort of conspiracy theories that fueled the mob's Jan. 6, 2021, riot.\"That sore loser is saying the same things he said before,\" Walton said earlier this month without mentioning the Republican presidential nominee by name. \"He's riling up the troops again, so if he doesn't get what he wants, it's not inconceivable that we will experience that same situation again. And who knows? It could be worse.\"Walton, a nominee of President George W. Bush, is not alone. Other judges have said the political climate is ripe for another attack like the one injured more than 100 police officers at the Capitol. As Election Day nears, judges are frequently stressing the need to send a message beyond their courtrooms that political violence can't be tolerated.Either side could be unhappy\"It scares me to think about what will happen if anyone on either side is not happy with the results of the election,\" Judge Jia Cobb, a nominee of President Joe Biden, said during a sentencing hearing last month for four Capitol rioters.Judge Rudolph Contreras lamented the potential for more politically motivated violence as he sentenced a Colorado man, Jeffrey Sabol, who helped other rioters drag a police officer into the mob. Sabol later told FBI agents that a \"call to battle was announced\" and that he had \"answered the call because he was a patriot warrior.\"\"It doesn't take much imagination to imagine a similar call coming out in the coming months, and the court would be concerned that Mr. Sabol would answer that call in the same way,\" Contreras, a President Barack Obama nominee, said in March before sentencing Sabol to more than five years in prison.Trump's distortion of the Jan. 6 attack has been a cornerstone of his bid to reclaim the White House. The former president has denied any responsibility for the crimes of supporters who smashed windows, assaulted police officers and sent lawmakers running into hiding as they met to certify President Joe Biden's 2020 victory.Trump has vowed to pardon rioters, whom he calls \"patriots\" and \"hostages,\" if he wins in November. And he said he would accept the results of the upcoming election only if it's \"free and fair,\" casting doubts reminiscent of his baseless claims in 2020.Judges have repeatedly used their platform on the bench to denounce those efforts to downplay the violence on Jan. 6 and cast the rioters as political prisoners. And some have raised concerns about what such rhetoric means for the future of the country and its democracy.\"We're in a real difficult time in our country, and I hope we can survive it,\" Walton said this month while sentencing a Tennessee nurse who used a pair of medical scissors to smash a glass door at the Capitol.\"I've got a young daughter, I've got a young grandson, and I would like for America to be available to them and be as good to them as it has been to me,\" he added. \"But I don't know if we survive with the mentality that took place that day.\"1.5K face federal crimes; little remorse seenMore than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes related to Jan. 6 siege, which disrupted the peaceful transfer of presidential power for the first time in the nation's history. Over 1,000 rioters have been convicted and sentenced. Roughly 650 of them received prison time ranging from a few days to 22 years.Justice Department prosecutors have argued in many cases that a prison sentence is necessary to deter convicted Capitol rioters from engaging in more politically motivated violence.\"With the 2024 presidential election approaching and many loud voices in the media and online continuing to sow discord and distrust, the potential for a repeat of January 6 looms ominously,\" prosecutors have repeatedly warned in court filings.Prosecutors argue that defendants who have shown little or no remorse for their actions on Jan. 6 could break the law again. Some rioters even seem to be proud of their crimes.The first rioter to enter the Capitol texted his mother, \"I'll go again given the opportunity.\" A man from Washington state who stormed the Capitol with fellow Proud Boys extremist group members told a judge, \"You can give me 100 years and I'd do it all over again.\" A Kentucky nurse who joined the riot told a television interviewer that she would \"do it again tomorrow.\"Need to 'lower the volume'A Colorado woman known to her social media followers as the \"J6 praying grandma\" avoided a prison sentence in August when a magistrate judge sentenced her for disorderly conduct and trespassing on Capitol grounds. Rebecca Lavrenz told the judge that God, not Trump, led her to Washington on Jan. 6.\"And she has all but promised to do it all over again,\" said prosecutor Terence Parker.Prosecutors had sought 10 months behind bars. After her April trial conviction, Lavrenz went on a \"media blitz\" to defend the mob, spread misinformation, undermine confidence in the courts and boost her celebrity in a community that believes Jan. 6 \"was a good day for this country,\" Parker said.Magistrate Zia Faruqui sentenced Lavrenz to six months of home confinement and fined her $103,000, stressing the need to \"lower the volume\" before the next election.\"These outside influences, the people that are tearing our country apart, they're not going to help you,\" Faruqui told her.",

With the presidential election approaching, Latifah emphasized the importance of every vote and publicly endorsed Kamala Harris, who could become the first woman president of the United States.Joined by Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, activist Tamika Mallory, Congressman Andy Kim and Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman, Latifah urged the crowd of about 1,000 to register to vote and support Harris.\"I don't want to go back to that,\" Latifah said, referring to the possibility of former President Donald Trump returning to office. She advocated for unity, stating, \"We don't need a dictator. We need unity, and we need the strength of our community.\"Latifah stressed the power of voting, \"Your vote is your power. If it didn't matter, they wouldn't try so hard to take it away from you,\" she said. This highlighted ongoing concerns about voter suppression and the need for community engagement in elections.By endorsing Harris, Latifah supports a potentially historic moment. \"I'm going to have the first woman president of these United States,\" she declared, inspiring hope among supporters.Latifah's political advocacy reflects a trend of celebrities using their platforms to influence social and political issues. Her support brings visibility to Harris' campaign and may encourage young voter participation.As the 2024 election nears, Latifah's speech serves as a reminder that every voice matters in shaping the nation's future. Her call for unity and voting rights resonates in a time of political division.The event highlights the growing role of celebrity influence in politics and the importance of community engagement in the democratic process. As election day approaches, Latifah's message underscores the power of individual votes and the potential for historic change.In an era of heightened political awareness, Latifah's appearance at Essex County College demonstrates how public figures can motivate civic participation and shape political discourse. Her endorsement of Harris not only supports a candidate but also advocates for increased representation in the highest office of the land.The rally also showcased the intersection of entertainment and politics, a trend that has gained momentum in recent years. As celebrities like Latifah use their influence to address political issues, they play a significant role in engaging younger generations and traditionally underrepresented communities in the political process.As the campaign season intensifies, events like this serve as crucial moments for voter education and mobilization. Latifah's message of empowerment and unity may resonate beyond the immediate audience, potentially influencing wider public opinion as the election draws near.",

    "title": "On Cat Memes, Cannibalism, and Election Lead-Up Laughter | Los Angeles Review of Books",
    "content": "YOU CAN PREDICT the outcome of the 2024 US presidential election by tracking the laughter in the room. Laughter glides on the edge of the unspeakable. It flirts with taboo obscenity and unbearable trauma while toeing the line and somehow lightening the tone. When Donald Trump absurdly accused Haitian migrants in Ohio of eating people's pets, silly videos of armed feline militias vied for viral visibility with TikTok loops of dogs and cats reacting to debate footage off-screen. Meanwhile, the endlessly memeable specter of ALF -- everyone's favorite cat-eating TV sitcom alien from the planet Melmac -- evoked the mock cannibalism of Jonathan Swift's \"A Modest Proposal\" (1729), a Juvenalian pamphlet that offered to solve the Irish overpopulation and starvation crisis by serving up newborn infants \"stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled.\"Like Swift's furious satire, the viral meme culture of the 2024 election showdown between fragile democracy and resurgent fascism is responding to the apocalyptic political conjuncture with grotesque absurdity. As reality unravels, the jokes will only get weirder.Intergenerational cannibalism has become more than a metaphor: the rich eating the poor's offspring, Protestants gobbling up the papacy, Satanists pan-frying Christian progeny, outlandish conspiracy theories that human remains were found in Oprah Winfrey's L.A. home. Coralie Fargeat's new body-horror satire film The Substance puts its finger on the pulse of the zeitgeist in its lurid cautionary tale of two women who threaten to destroy each other over their shared biological destiny of spontaneous de-aging. A 21st-century All About Eve (1950) with an appetite for bone-cracking flesh, The Substance's extremity speaks vividly to generational antagonisms that transcend left versus right (let alone Democrat versus Republican) as they converge on nothing less than the fate of humanity.The story of a 50-year-old fitness guru (Demi Moore) who spawns a younger, \"more perfect\" doppelgänger (Margaret Qualley) out of a slit in her back offers a spine-tingling allegory for our cataclysmic, click-thirsty times. Though not exactly a knee-slapper, The Substance satirizes the slow-burn horrors of our collective gusto for perpetual novelty over the less glamorous business of species survival, noncompliance with genocide, and protecting the future of the planet.The political humor of the 2024 elections appeals to our pervasive feelings of historical doom, particularly around the impossibility of immediate revolutionary social change. Is the popular vanguard just a decoy from the old regime's death grip? A recent cartoon by Adam Zyglis depicts the \"Kamala Coalition\" as a union of Gen-Z \"Swifties\" and Bush-era neocons, juxtaposing Taylor Swift holding up a protest sign reading \"The Tortured Poets Dept. for Harris\" next to Dick Cheney's ominous admission of \"The Torture Dept. for Harris.\" The temporary misalignment of opposites -- spliced together by an inappropriate pun -- is one of the oldest jokes in the book. As late-night TV host Jimmy Fallon put it, \"You know these are strange times when Dick Cheney and Barbra Streisand are voting for the same person.\"Generational commitment against historical erasure is the optimistic subtext for Harris's most viral campaign line: \"You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?!\" Laughing and quoting her late mother Shyamala Gopalan at a 2023 ceremony for educational equity, Harris continued, \"You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.\" The coconut tree has of course become an indelible icon of Harris's blazing ascent to the candidacy in late July (maybe rivaled only by Charli XCX's \"kamala is brat\"). Coconut memes echo the Harris campaign's anti-MAGA rallying cry of \"We're not going back!\" while sidestepping the elephant in the room of what exactly it would mean to move forward.Though not known for his upbeat sense of humor, Karl Marx had a very different understanding of materialist stasis and the inescapable predominance of political farce. To Swifties from Swiftboating -- let alone to zoomorphic cannibal memes from Jonathan Swift -- has the flavor of Marx's well-worn critique of farcical recurrence in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (1852), which opens with his famous addendum to Hegel: history repeats itself \"the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.\" But there is nothing funny about farce in Marx's account, a genre that arises from the horrible sensation of being haunted by \"dead generations\" who weigh \"like a nightmare on the brains of the living.\" This is precisely why the revolutionary class -- the Prussian proletariat then, pro-Palestine student uprisers now -- can only make their own history \"under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past.\"Loosely paraphrased, when the old guard loses its popular legitimacy but maintains its death grip on hegemonic power, it inevitably lapses into sickening farce. Cat memes are cold comfort as \"dead generations\" would rather throw out the mother than risk spilling the baby's bathwater.For Harris, whose coconut tree metaphor went viral (again) on social media in the exuberant hours after Joe Biden suspended his gaffe-laden candidacy, generational inheritance means honoring a biographical debt: we owe something to our family and to the people who came before us. Their unfinished lives and unfulfilled hopes inextricably entangle the prospects of our own. But the personal does not map neatly onto the political. The existential urgency of confronting climate denialism and its foothold in unfettered corporate capitalism will demand a deep reckoning with the idioms and ideologies of the past, nicely captured by a silly Onion headline: \"Baby Boomers Leave Entire $78.55 Trillion Fortune to Single Spoiled Pomeranian.\" If not the earth, it is the pets who shall inherit the surplus value.Comedy provides an irresistible filter for witnessing the unwatchable and giving shape to the utter senselessness of gruesome, spectacle-based reality. We turn to ludicrous gags and anthropomorphic cat memes in the throes of violent upheaval and historical impasse. Who can forget Tom Hooper's pornographic CGI reboot of Andrew Lloyd Webber's long-running Broadway musical Cats? Released on the cusp of the COVID-19 pandemic, the resounding belly flop of Cats became an emblem for the pervasive feeling of being trapped between incommensurable worlds: the revolutionary desire for immediate structural change and immovable continuation of all the old, destructive powers. Universally panned as \"unfilmable,\" a \"tragical mess,\" and \"the worst movie ever made,\" Cats featured an uncanny wallpaper of mega-celebrities bedecked in digital fur and wagging their VFX tails, which ran roughshod over what Lauren Berlant theorized as \"the historical sensorium\" in their book on Cruel Optimism (2011). Gluttons for the taste of catnip, we gleefully took the bait.The writer Kate Aronoff offered a Gramscian reading of the movie on Twitter, pairing a still -- Taylor Swift, flaunting a jewel-encrusted bottled labeled \"Catnip\" -- with the caption \"The crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.\" Cats predominated as a morbid symptom for the unrepresentable crises of 2019 and their aftermath. Five years later, we sure have come a long way. Instead of Jellicle matriarchs preening in digital orange fur that Dame Judi Dench once compared to \"five foxes fucking on  back,\" Ohio house cats are being recruited by fake websites to enlist in a rogue militia, issuing a simulacral counterattack against the unaccountable spread of xenophobic, racist conspiracy theories.The thing about \"morbid symptoms\" is that their absurd facade belies the horrors of real world violence. Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, now face routine death threats due to Trump and J. D. Vance's false accusations while daily bomb sweeps have been mandated in public schools across the state. There is nothing funny about these fatal consequences.Humor often traffics in the taboo, daring to go where it shouldn't. When there's a mass shooting in the United States (of which there have been over 400 so far this year), The Onion often reprints the same headline: \"'No Way to Prevent This,' Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens.\" It is tempting to overestimate the social consequence of satirical jokes -- even morbid, furious, and weaponized political jokes -- because they make us feel a little better and briefly lighten our load. In Borat Subsequent Moviefilm (2020), a macabre mockumentary filmed in the run-up to the 2020 elections, Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) takes his daughter Tutar (Maria Bakalova) to a crisis pregnancy center after she accidentally swallows a plastic baby figurine behind the back alleyway of a Christian bakery. Borat's repeated declaration that he \"put the baby in her\" exposes an anti-abortionist Evangelical pastor's conspiracy to excuse a seeming confession of rape and incest. The pastor misunderstands Borat, but there's no misunderstanding his response.I laughed my head off at the gag's brazen obscenity and on-the-nose topicality. Two years later, the Supreme Court voted 6-3 to overturn the precedent and protections of Roe v. Wade (1973). And somehow, the first thing I thought of upon hearing this devastating news of Dobbs v. Jackson was the crisis pregnancy prank in Borat Subsequent Moviefilm.Comedy squares the circle of creative rebellion and toothless disavowal -- a shot of pleasure to chase otherwise indigestible news (mixing metaphors of \"the substance\" and Borat's bakery antics). Wrong laughter \"hammer into every brain the old lesson that continuous friction, the breaking down of all individual resistance, is the condition of life in this society,\" to dredge up Max Horkheimer and T. W. Adorno's bitter analysis of the long-suffering but unflappable Donald Duck. As they put it, cartoon ducks \"get their thrashing so that the audience can learn to take their own punishment.\" (For a surreal treatment, see Daffy Duck in 1953's Duck Amuck.) Whether that humorous twist represents an act of imaginative transgression or one of passive submission (\"I know, but all the same\": the mantra of disavowal) remains an open question days away from the 2024 elections.We need to know why we are laughing because everything is at stake! Project 2025 would, among other authoritarian policy initiatives, dismantle the Department of Education, further criminalize abortion and defund access to reproductive healthcare, gut federal labor protections, deny transgender personhood, and radically expand the executive powers of the presidency. A second term of Trump would make the early snafus of Sean Spicer's \"Holocaust centers,\" Kellyanne Conway's \"alternative facts,\" and Rudy Giuliani's Four Seasons Total Landscaping fiasco feel like teleporting into a quaint time capsule.What is the power of laughter to effect social change and give voice to the unspeakable? After the Democratic National Committee held its \"historically diverse\" convention in August while banning all Palestinian speakers, Jon Stewart (who returned to host The Daily Show once a week) skewered the hypocrisy in a widely viewed segment that contrasted the Harris campaign's rallying cry of \"joy\" and \"happiness\" with its complicity in funding and forgetting the genocide in Gaza. What Stewart was saying is nothing new. Student-led uprisings on college campuses around the world have condemned US backing for the occupation and demanded institutional divestment from Israeli companies and weapons manufacturers that arm the genocide, which has killed over 43,000 Palestinians to date while targeting hospitals, schools, civilians, children, and journalists. \"Israel Accuses Al Jazeera of Being Mouthpiece for Journalism,\" joked The Onion in May and again in September as Israel shut down Al Jazeera's Ramallah bureau amid the exploding device massacres in Lebanon, senselessly escalated by relentless airstrikes and rapidly mushrooming into all-out regional war.Satire is meant to hold up a mirror to the place of the laughing spectator, who compulsively wants to have it both ways. We walk a razor-thin edge between protest and disavowal -- or coping and cowardice -- in turning to humor as a vehicle for voicing dissent against unimaginable atrocities and obscene abuses of power.When Stewart hosted The Daily Show from 1999 to 2015, satire felt immediately consequential as a response to the catastrophic juggernaut of the Iraq War and freewheeling rise of far-right conspiracy theorists at Fox News. \"lending the mimetic and the real,\" observes Amber Day in her book Satire and Dissent: Interventions in Contemporary Political Debate (2011), the parodic news show \"enables and articulates a critique of the inadequacies of contemporary political discourse, while demonstrating an engaged commitment to the possibility of a more honest public debate.\" Whether that also applied to the years that sowed the seeds of neocolonial domination and runaway social inequality -- paving the way to Trumpism, Brexit, and autocracy across the globe -- remains up for grabs.Less controversial is the truism that satire had been crudely defanged by 2016. By the rise of Trump, as Emily Nussbaum wryly observes in \"How Jokes Won the Election,\" \"the wheel had spun hard the other way: now it was the neo-fascist strongman who held the microphone and an army of anonymous dirty-joke dispensers who helped put him in office.\" No longer \"the rebel's stance,\" comedic taboo became the property of xenophobic conspiracy-peddlers and misogynist clickbaiters in its immediate collective sway and irreversible electoral consequences.The tone has since tightened like a noose around the necks of even gallows humorists, preempting anything like Freud's escapist joke in his little essay \"Humour\" (1927), where a prisoner about to be executed on a Monday says: \"Well, the week's beginning nicely.\" There are no more Mondays when the Doomsday Clock hovers at 90 seconds to midnight. After Biden stepped aside on July 21, I was one among many who felt a strange surge of playful hope. The inevitability of another Trump term had been briefly averted with a sneaky substitution trick of competent Black woman for rambling octogenarian.Despite the \"childless cat lady\" antics and Tim Walz's heartwarming dad jokes, much of that initial optimism has significantly cooled (at least, for many of us). But the desperate will to avert full-scale fascism continues to hold strong. Criminalization of free speech, violent social oppression, and impunity for genocide are somehow now the table stakes.As the satirists remind us, things can always get worse.",

    "title": "this president was almost an octogenarian when he took office",
    "content": "The 2024 presidential election is looming, with Vice President Kamala Harris facing off against former president Donald Trump. However, argues Matt Bai in an opinion piece published in The Washington Post, it's neither Harris nor Trump that is the most influential character in this race, but Trump's running mate J.D. Vance. Trump is older in age, and will be 78 years old by the time the election occurs. Says Bai, this presents the possibility that Trump will eventually have to leave the presidency due to health issues. As such, we should consider what might happen if that occurred, and the fact that Vance would inevitably take over the Oval Office. He equates this to a similar situation between Eisenhower, who was seen as notably old at the time of his presidency, and Nixon; had Eisenhower passed away from a serious heart attack, the Nixon presidency would have been far sooner than it was.These conversations bring up an interesting point: how old is too old when it comes to the person who is leading our country? As our presidents seem to get older in age, the discussion about presidential age limits has significantly increased -- as have questions about competency. Here, 24/7 Wall St. broke down the qualifications to be president of the United States, the pros and cons of instituting an age limit, and how old each U.S. president was at the time of inauguration. We've consulted sources such as WhiteHouse.gov, the American Presidency Project, and Britannica to assemble comparative data on each President. They are arranged from youngest to oldest based on their age at inauguration. (These are the least 15 popular U.S. presidents with millennials, ranked.)Why This is Important to Talk AboutAs the political drama in our country comes to a head, it's worth looking at the historical context to understand how old our previous presidents were when they took office and what they achieved despite, or perhaps thanks to, their age and experience. This illustrates that age is not necessarily a factor in a President being able to make positive contributions to the country. However, you will also note that the trend toward electing elderly people to the highest office in the land has become stronger in modern times. It's worth considering why this is the case and what, if anything, should be done about it.Presidential QualificationsSo what does it take to be President of the United States? First, it's important to note that there's no maximum age limit for presidential candidates -- though there are minimum age limits. The Constitution posits that presidents must be:What is a natural born citizen? It is someone who was born a citizen and did not have to go through a legal process to become an American. So if someone was born overseas, but to American parents, they could be eligible to run for President.Could We Add an Age Limit to the Constitution?Requiring an upward age limit for Presidential candidates would involve changing the Constitution, a process the Founding Fathers intentionally made quite difficult. Their goal was that any constitutional changes would reflect a national consensus about certain issues.To propose an Amendment, either two-thirds of both houses of Congress (67 of 100 Senators and 290 out of 435 Representatives) have to approve it, or two-thirds of the states (34 states) can call for a constitutional convention. Once the Amendment passes one of those hurdles, it must be ratified by 75% of the country's state legislatures (38 states). It's such a strenuous process to reach this level of consensus that the Constitution has only been amended 27 times in the country's 237-year history. As such, we'd say that the possibility of a constitutional amendment here may not be in the books.Are Presidential Age Limits Likely to Happen?American culture has a noticeable bias toward youth. We tend to think of older age as a liability rather than an asset. There are arguments to be made on both sides, and we'll give a few examples below. But the main reason a presidential age limit is unlikely to be approved is that Senators, Representatives, and members of state legislatures often have their own presidential ambitions. As many of them are also elderly, they would be at a disadvantage if age limits were set -- which means that their support for this matter probably isn't that strong..As a general rule, it's hard to get lawmakers to vote to restrict their own power. However, in a scenario where public backlash against aged candidates votes them out of office and creates a supermajority of younger legislators with a mandate for change, then Presidential and even Congressional age limits might be on the table.Pros: Presidential Age LimitCons: Presidential Age LimitHere are the ages of all 46 U.S. presidents at inauguration and what they accomplished in office:",

It's going to be about 60 of these more rural, post-industrial, working-class counties that are going to have the outside effect in this election cycle.\"\"This is definitely more 2016,\" Zito added. \"I have argued for a while that the election that might end up being a fluke is not 2016, which a lot of people saw it, but 2020.Featured Local SavingsZito noted the appeal that Elon Musk, who has endorsed Trump and recently joined him on the campaign trail, is having with voters is because he represents the \"American ethos of the dignity of work.\"Voters in Pennsylvania, the battleground state with the most Electoral College votes, have recently seen several campaign stops from both Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris.

    "content": "Donald Trump attacked his rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, touted the support of steelworkers and appeared to make surprising remarks about golf legend Arnold Palmer at a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday to drum up support in the critical state .Pennsylvania is one of the key states both candidates are seeking in their respective presidential bids. As of Sunday, with less than three weeks until Election Day, Harris and Trump were neck and neck in the Keystone State, according to an aggregation of national polls by FiveThirtyEight.The rally came after Trump faced criticism for disjointed speeches and a series of canceled appearances, although his supporters largely dismissed those concerns.Bloomberg editor-in-chief John Micklethwait interrupted Trump at an event Tuesday while he was discussing wars, with the interviewer saying the question was about tariffs. Trump also canceled a National Rifle Association event in Georgia scheduled for next week, which the organization said was due to a scheduling conflict.Trump Shocks Audience With \"***VP\" RemarkIn his speech in Pittsburgh, the former president blasted Harris, whom he called \"radical left.\"\"You need to tell Kamala Harris that you've had enough, that you can't take it anymore,\" the former president said.\"We can't stand you, you're a *** vice president, the worst. You're the worst vice president. Kamala, you're fired, get the hell out of here, you're fired, get out of here. \"Steelworker ApprovalsTrump also touted the support of steelworkers, several of whom joined him on stage, including US Steelworkers 1557 Vice President Richard Tikey.\"Today, I am honored to receive the support of three local unions representing American steel,\" Trump announced at the rally. Polls have shown that Trump enjoys strong support among working-class voters.Not all steelworker unions have supported Trump, as the United Steelworkers supported Harris in July.Anecdote from Arnold PalmerDuring the rally, Trump appeared to insinuate that golf legend Arnold Palmer was well endowed.Trump said the late golfer, who died in 2016, was \"a man\" and \"when he took showers with other pros, they would come out of there and say, 'Oh my God, this is amazing.'Trump stressed that he \"had to say it\" but didn't say anything more explicit out of respect for the \"very sophisticated\" women in the crowd.While attendees laughed at the remarks, they were met with a mix of confusion and criticism on social media.J Adams-Falconer, a White House communications strategist and media affairs official during the Obama administration, noted that Trump spoke for about 15 minutes and ended with \"a story about the size\" of Palmer's genitals.\"Imagine the things he will say when his brain is four years older,\" said Richard Hanania, founder and president of the Center for the Study of Partisanship and Ideology think tank.Donald Trump (left) wearing a hard hat given to him by a steelworker during a rally October 19, 2024 in Latrobe, Pennsylvania.

    "title": "Reality tv star reverses Trump support after education policy reveal",
    "content": "In an unexpected shift, reality tv star Alexis Skyy has withdrawn her endorsement of Donald Trump following controversy over his education policies. Skyy, who initially voiced support for the former president, has now clarified her stance on social media after researching candidates for the 2024 presidential election.During a recent interview with KISS 104.1, Skyy had openly declared her intention to vote for Trump, citing personal reasons and a belief that his previous presidency benefited the economy.\"I'm voting for Trump! I just feel like when Trump was around, things were different,\" she stated, acknowledging mixed opinions about him while expressing her belief that he was effective.However, Skyy's perspective changed dramatically after Trump announced plans to dismantle the Department of Education if re-elected. On Oct. 19, she updated her Instagram followers, revealing that her initial interview predated Trump's education policy announcement.\"The interview I did regarding voting was done prior to Trump's statement on the Department of Education. Initially, I wanted to vote for Trump for my own personal reasons. After familiarizing myself with both candidates, I will no longer be voting for him,\" Skyy wrote in an Instagram Story.This statement marked a significant shift in Skyy's position, driven by the implications of Trump's proposed education policy.The social media reaction was swift and critical. Many users on platforms like Instagram voiced disapproval, suggesting Skyy should have educated herself before making such a public declaration. Comments ranged from disbelief to mockery.One user stated, \"The first mistake was ignorantly about to cast your vote without educating yourself in the first place!\" Others questioned her decision-making process, asking, \"So she didn't think to familiarize herself with the candidates before speaking?\"Some users nostalgically remarked, \"Remember when we didn't publicly say who we were voting for?\" The backlash underscores the importance of being informed about political candidates and their policies before making public endorsements.Trump's controversial remarks about the Department of Education have raised concerns across the political spectrum. In a recent Fox News interview, he stated, \"We're going to take the Department of Education and close it. I'm going to close it,\" while criticizing the current state of U.S. education.His plan includes cutting funding for public schools that teach certain subjects, sparking significant debate about the future of American education. These proposals have become a focal point in discussions about the upcoming election and its potential impact on the education system.Skyy's experience serves as a reminder of the critical need for political awareness and education as the 2024 presidential election approaches. Voters must engage with candidates' policies and statements to make informed decisions that will impact their lives and communities.The incident also highlights the power of social media in shaping public discourse around political issues. As celebrities and influencers increasingly use these platforms to share their political views, the potential for both positive engagement and backlash grows.For many voters, especially those in communities historically underserved by the education system, the stakes of education policy are particularly high. Trump's proposal to eliminate the Department of Education has raised questions about the future of federal support for public schools, student loan programs and civil rights enforcement in education.As the political landscape evolves, it's essential for individuals to stay informed and critically evaluate the implications of their voting choices. Skyy's change of heart demonstrates that voters can and do adjust their views as they become more informed about candidates' positions.The controversy also raises questions about the role of celebrity endorsements in politics. While public figures have the right to express their views, their statements can have significant influence on their followers. This incident underscores the responsibility that comes with such influence and the importance of due diligence before making political statements.As the 2024 election cycle heats up, voters are encouraged to research candidates thoroughly, considering their policy proposals and track records rather than relying solely on endorsements or sound bites. The education policy debate sparked by this incident is likely to remain a key issue as candidates continue to outline their visions for the country's future.",

    "title": "Judges punishing Jan. 6 rioters fear more political violence",
    "content": "Over the past four years, judges at Washington's federal courthouse have punished hundreds of rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol in an unprecedented assault on the nation's democracy. On the cusp of the next presidential election, some of those judges fear another burst of political violence could be coming.Before recently sentencing a rioter to prison, U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton said he prays Americans accept the outcome of next month's election. But the veteran judge expressed concern that Donald Trump and his allies are spreading the same sort of conspiracy theories that fueled the mob's Jan. 6, 2021, riot.\"That sore loser is saying the same things he said before,\" Walton said earlier this month without mentioning the Republican presidential nominee by name. \"He's riling up the troops again, so if he doesn't get what he wants, it's not inconceivable that we will experience that same situation again. And who knows? It could be worse.\"Walton, a nominee of President George W. Bush, is not alone. Other judges have said the political climate is ripe for another attack like the one injured more than 100 police officers at the Capitol. As Election Day nears, judges are frequently stressing the need to send a message beyond their courtrooms that political violence can't be tolerated.\"It scares me to think about what will happen if anyone on either side is not happy with the results of the election,\" Judge Jia Cobb, a nominee of President Joe Biden, said during a sentencing hearing last month for four Capitol rioters.Judge Rudolph Contreras lamented the potential for more politically motivated violence as he sentenced a Colorado man, Jeffrey Sabol, who helped other rioters drag a police officer into the mob. Sabol later told FBI agents that a \"call to battle was announced\" and that he had \"answered the call because he was a patriot warrior.\"\"It doesn't take much imagination to imagine a similar call coming out in the coming months, and the court would be concerned that Mr. Sabol would answer that call in the same way,\" Contreras, a President Barack Obama nominee, said in March before sentencing Sabol to more than five years in prison.Trump's distortion of the Jan. 6 attack has been a cornerstone of his bid to reclaim the White House. The former president has denied any responsibility for the crimes of supporters who smashed windows, assaulted police officers and sent lawmakers running into hiding as they met to certify President Joe Biden's 2020 victory.Trump has vowed to pardon rioters, whom he calls \"patriots\" and \"hostages,\" if he wins in November. And he said he would accept the results of the upcoming election only if it's \"free and fair,\" casting doubts reminiscent of his baseless claims in 2020.Judges have repeatedly used their platform on the bench to denounce those efforts to downplay the violence on Jan. 6 and cast the rioters as political prisoners. And some have raised concerns about what such rhetoric means for the future of the country and its democracy.\"We're in a real difficult time in our country, and I hope we can survive it,\" Walton said this month while sentencing a Tennessee nurse who used a pair of medical scissors to smash a glass door at the Capitol.\"I've got a young daughter, I've got a young grandson, and I would like for America to be available to them and be as good to them as it has been to me,\" he added. \"But I don't know if we survive with the mentality that took place that day.\"More than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes related to Jan. 6 siege, which disrupted the peaceful transfer of presidential power for the first time in the nation's history. Over 1,000 rioters have been convicted and sentenced. Roughly 650 of them received prison time ranging from a few days to 22 years.Justice Department prosecutors have argued in many cases that a prison sentence is necessary to deter convicted Capitol rioters from engaging in more politically motivated violence.\"With the 2024 presidential election approaching and many loud voices in the media and online continuing to sow discord and distrust, the potential for a repeat of January 6 looms ominously,\" prosecutors have repeatedly warned in court filings.Prosecutors argue that defendants who have shown little or no remorse for their actions on Jan. 6 could break the law again. Some rioters even seem to be proud of their crimes.The first rioter to enter the Capitol texted his mother, \"I'll go again given the opportunity.\" A man from Washington state who stormed the Capitol with fellow Proud Boys extremist group members told a judge, \"You can give me 100 years and I'd do it all over again.\" A Kentucky nurse who joined the riot told a television interviewer that she would \"do it again tomorrow.\"A Colorado woman known to her social media followers as the \"J6 praying grandma\" avoided a prison sentence in August when a magistrate judge sentenced her for disorderly conduct and trespassing on Capitol grounds. Rebecca Lavrenz told the judge that God, not Trump, led her to Washington on Jan. 6.\"And she has all but promised to do it all over again,\" said prosecutor Terence Parker.Prosecutors had sought 10 months behind bars. After her April trial conviction, Lavrenz went on a \"media blitz\" to defend the mob, spread misinformation, undermine confidence in the courts and boost her celebrity in a community that believes Jan. 6 \"was a good day for this country,\" Parker said.Magistrate Zia Faruqui sentenced Lavrenz to six months of home confinement and fined her $103,000, stressing the need to \"lower the volume\" before the next election.\"These outside influences, the people that are tearing our country apart, they're not going to help you,\" Faruqui told her.",

He realized things had to change when he had lunch with a former Speaker of the Georgia House.\"I was really excited because we were going to Subway, which meant I could eat and take the other half home,\" he said.The low point came later when he signed on to announce high school basketball. He missed the team bus because he was filing a race report and had to walk 12 miles home.His Republican, protectionist instincts took a populist turn when he realized that while there were bailouts for Wall Street, there were no bailouts for former newspaper owners who were limited to buying supermarket chickens at a $5 discount at 8 p.m.Salvation came first in the form of a job at a Virginia newspaper running op-ed pages, which then became an opportunity in radio.

There are plenty of possible policies, he says, without having to rely on gimmicks.Earlier, Florida's Anthony proved the point. After talking about the final voting numbers, the caller dropped a landmine.\"Kamala has Diddy... oops,\" he said, referring to the disgraced music mogul who has been accused of conspiracy and sex trafficking, in addition to a series of sexual abuse lawsuits (all denied by the star).\"I have to go,\" Fredericks says hurriedly, tapping his finger against the laptop he uses to run the show, interrupting the caller before he can say anything else.His show ends at 9am and is handed over to a series of other presenters, and Fredericks has time for a cup of oatmeal before picking up the phone and working his way through advertisers' call lists.\"Do we want the opportunity to take the populist message to more of America? Yes,' he said.'Is that part of the vision? Absolute.But without having a profitable business, you can't do it. You've got to get the ads, you've got to get the sponsors. You have to give them something back. You have to take care of them. And if you do that, you can get the message across.\"",

    "title": "Is a Trump victory on the horizon? Betting markets show dramatic changes ahead of polls",
    "content": "US Presidential Election 2024: As the presidential election approaches, polling data shows a tight race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, but prediction markets indicate a strong lead for Trump, currently pegged at a 60% chance of victory. Significant betting activity on platforms like Polymarket, totaling $30 million, has raised questions about the influence of high-profile bettors. While polling averages give Harris a slight edge, Trump is gaining momentum, especially in crucial swing states like Pennsylvania. Campaign efforts intensify as both candidates prepare for the final weeks leading up to Election Day.With less than three weeks remaining until the presidential election, recent polls indicate a close contest between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. However, prediction markets paint a different picture. Analysts are closely watching the shifting odds on betting platforms, particularly Polymarket, where reports suggest that an individual or a group may be influencing Trump's odds after placing substantial bets totaling $30 million, according to Business Insider.Current data from Election Betting Odds, which aggregates information from major markets, shows Trump with a 57% chance of victory, the largest margin in his favor since July 29, up from about 48% at the end of September. Other betting sites confirm this trend, with Betfair estimating Trump's chances at roughly 58%, Kalshi at 57%, and Smarkets at 58%. On Polymarket, the odds have shifted significantly, with Trump now holding a 60% chance of winning compared to Harris's 40%. This change has sparked speculation among political pundits and social media users about whether certain high-profile Americans might be influencing these betting trends.Despite the positive momentum for Trump in prediction markets, polling averages present a more complex scenario. Polling analysis from FiveThirtyEight indicates that Harris holds a slight edge, with approximately 48-49% support compared to Trump's 46-47%. Notably, this is the first time since late July that Harris has dropped below 50% support on the PredictIt platform, where traders now favor Trump 54% to 49%.Pennsylvania is considered the most critical swing state in this election, with its 19 electoral votes vital for both candidates' paths to victory. Groups supporting Trump and Harris are expected to spend over $138 million on TV and radio ads from late September until Election Day, indicating the importance of this battleground. According to The New York Times, polling analysis suggests that strong anti-Trump sentiments and a growing non-white population in the state over the past two decades have contributed to Harris's initial popularity among Democratic voter groups. Generally, Asian, Black, and Hispanic voters tend to lean more Democratic.Moreover, significant campaign efforts are underway. Former President Barack Obama is scheduled to join Harris in Georgia on October 24, while former First Lady Michelle Obama will campaign with Vice President Harris in Michigan on October 26, as reported by Bloomberg, citing a senior campaign official who requested anonymity. This will mark Michelle Obama's first appearance in battleground states for Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.The contrasting trends between prediction markets and polling data often occur during election cycles. Betting markets, like those on Polymarket, reflect how participants perceive the probability of winning, rather than direct voter sentiment. Nate Silver, a statistician associated with FiveThirtyEight, has noted that betting markets might exhibit a bias based on the demographics of participants. He suggests that Trump-leaning users on platforms like Polymarket may skew the results, leading to higher perceived odds for Trump even when polls suggest a closer contest.In addition to the trends in prediction markets, broader financial indicators have also favored Trump in recent weeks. Stocks linked to Trump's business ventures, such as the Trump Media and Technology Group, have surged, with shares rising 86% in October. Investors view these market movements as proxies for increasing confidence in a Trump victory. Financial sectors that could benefit from potential policy shifts under a Trump administration, including banking and cryptocurrencies, have also shown strong performance.As Election Day approaches, the competition intensifies between Trump and Harris. While prediction markets indicate a strong likelihood for Trump, polling data reveals a more nuanced picture. The next few weeks will be crucial as both candidates ramp up their campaigns in key swing states, ultimately shaping the outcome of this contentious election.",

If we vote early, that's it,' he said.'The click baiters who are still driving game-day voting based on algorithms and servers on the moon and drones hacking into machines and changing votes in the middle of the night. This is the stuff that's killing us.'Trump held a town hall in Oaks, just outside Philadelphia, on Monday eveningTwo people were taken ill and Trump turned the event into an impromptu dance party alongside Gov. Kristi Noem of South DakotaYour browser does not support iframes.Fredericks has little time for the conspiracy theorists and he is notable for welcoming Democrats on to his show. There's enough policy to go around, he says, without having to rely on gimmicks.Earlier, Anthony from Florida proved the point. After chatting about the latest polling numbers the caller dropped a landmine.'Kamala has got Diddy... oops,' he said, referring to the disgraced music mogul accused of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, alongside a string of sexual abuse lawsuits (all denied by the star).'I gotta go,' says Fredericks hurriedly, his finger punching at the laptop he uses to run the show and cutting off the caller before he can say any more.His show wraps at 9am, handing off to a string of other presenters, and Fredericks has time for a cup of oatmeal before picking up the phone and working his way through call sheets of advertisers.'Do we want to have the opportunity to bring the populist message to a larger segment of America? Yes,' he said.'Is that part of the vision? Absolutely.But without having a profitable business, you can't do it. You got to get the ads, you got to get the sponsors. You got to give them a return. You got to take care of them. And if you do that, then you can get the message out.'",

    "content": "TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Prabowo Subianto and Gibran Rakabuming Raka were officially inaugurated as the president and vice president of Indonesia for the 2024-2029 term on Sunday, October 20.Let's revisit some of the key promises Prabowo-Gibran made during his campaign, many of which have been incorporated into the draft of the Quick Win Program (PHTC) for 2025 with a substantial budget of Rp121 trillion, up from previously Rp113 trillion.One of the most prominent programs emphasized by Prabowo is the provision of free nutritious meals. During a grand campaign at Gelora Bung Karno, Senayan, Central Jakarta, on Saturday, February 10, 2024, he declared that if elected president, he would implement a program of free lunch and milk for Indonesian children.\"For me, those who say that providing lunch to our children is not important are not of sound mind and do not love this country. I have no doubt, Prabowo-Gibran have no doubt, we will provide lunch for the children of Indonesia,\" the Gerindra chief patron said at the grand campaign.The free nutritious meal program is included in one of Prabowo's Quick Win programs. In 2025, the budget was set at Rp71 trillion, which will eventually cover 15.42 million people in 514 districts/cities.Prabowo pledged to implement free health check-ups including for blood pressure, blood sugar, and X-rays and screenings for catastrophic diseases, with an allocated budget of up to Rp3.2 trillion. The new government is also committed to addressing tuberculosis (TB) cases, with the goal of reducing TB cases to 272 per 100,000 population.Prabowo planned a program for the construction of complete quality hospitals in regional areas, upgrading existing hospitals from type D to type C and investing in facilities, infrastructure, and medical equipment. This program is allocated Rp1.8 trillion.He also prioritizes the improvement of schools, including renovations of classrooms, furniture, and toilet facilities up to 22,000 rooms, with a total budget of Rp20 trillion. Additionally, the construction of four superior high schools in the new capital city IKN, NTT, North Sulawesi, and North Maluku is planned, with a budget of Rp4 trillion.Prabowo also launched the development of a national food barn in regions and villages with the intensification of agricultural land by 80,000 hectares and the creation of new rice fields by 150,000 hectares. This program will receive supporting facilities and infrastructure worth Rp15 trillion.The new government is committed to continuing and adding social welfare card programs as well as business assistance cards to eliminate absolute poverty, which reached 0.8 percent this year and is targeted to reach 0 percent next year.The new government also launched initiatives to develop village infrastructure and provide affordable housing with good sanitation for those in need. These efforts include the construction of 914,573 units of land-based and vertical housing and the eradication of 563.1 hectares of slums.Furthermore, the Chair of the Presidential Housing Task Force, Hashim Djojohadikusumo, announced that the program aims to build three million homes within a year, leading to the construction of 15 million homes over a five-year governance period.Hashim, who is also Prabowo's younger brother, explained that the plan to build 3 million homes annually involves constructing 1 million apartments in urban areas and 2 million housing units in rural areas.Prabowo Subianto also pledged to achieve an economic growth rate exceeding 8 percent if elected president in the 2024 Presidential Election. \"I am optimistic that our growth -- if I am given the mandate -- I aim for a minimum of 8 percent,\" Prabowo said in the Trimegah Political and Economic Outlook 2024.According to Prabowo, this target economic growth can be achieved by building upon the foundation laid by President Jokowi and previous presidents.

    "title": "Presidents of the United States: John Adams, the politician-philosopher who served as first Vice President and second US President",
    "content": "Editor's Note: This profile is part of a series taking a closer look at US presidents ahead of the 2024 presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.John Adams was a remarkable man - honest, blunt, independent and brilliant.He was a writer, a thinker, a politician and a philosopher.Adams was the second first Vice President of the United States and the first Vice President.His son John Quincy Adams would later follow in his footsteps and become president.Adams' contemporaries - George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, James Madison and James Monroe - all regarded him as a towering figure and first-rate intellect.Adams was born on October 30, 1735, Massachusetts' Braintree.His parents were John Adams and Susanna Boylston. His father John was a farmer and shoemaker.However, the family had a distinguished lineage. They could trace their roots back to the first Puritan settlers in New England.Though Adams' father, a Deacon in the Church, wanted him to pursue a career in the ministry, Adams instead chose the law.Adams graduated from Harvard in 1755 and then began practising law in Boston.In 1764, Adams made one of the most important decisions of his life.He married Abigail Smith - a witty, well-read and independent woman whom he would refer to as 'Dearest Friend' and whose wise counsel he would come to sorely rely on in the turbulent decades ahead.Adams' reputation, both as a lawyer and a man of principle, got a big boost when he agreed to take the case of the British soldiers who fired on a crowd in Boston -- also know as the Bostom Massacre.Though Adams' performance resulted in the acquittal of all the men, it also made him highly unpopular with many.PoliticsAdams in 1774 was chosen to serve in the Massachusetts delegation to the First Continental Congress.It was here that he made his reputation as a staunch defender of American liberty.He also made some invaluable contributions to American history.It was Adams who suggested that Washington be put in charge of the Continental Army.He also chose Jefferson to write the Declaration of Independence and defended the draft with all his might.Congress then chose Adams to serve as a diplomat in France.Adams, who would join Benjamin Franklin, also took his sons Charles and John Quincy.Though Adams did not display the demeanour and temperament of a diplomat, he and Franklin worked together to achieve the Peace in Paris treaty.In 1784, Congress sent Jefferson as Franklin's replacement.It was here that the two men, already well-acquainted with each other, would become inseparable.Adams was then chosen to serve as American Ambassador to England.In 1788, Adams finally returned to the country he loved.He had spent a decade, including the entire Revolutionary War, abroad in its service.Time in officeAdams found himself in the running for president after his return to America.But it was a fait accompli.Washington was the unanimous choice of all electors. Adams, though, came in a respectable second.As per the rules of the new Constitution, that made Adams the Vice President of the United States.Adams was extremely unfulfilled as Vice President - a largely ceremonial role that consisted of him presiding over the US Senate and breaking ties.Adams would cast around three dozen votes as Chair of the Senate - more than any vice president in American history.\"My country has in its wisdom contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived,\" Adams complained to his wife.When Washington announced he was stepping down after two-terms, Adams was his natural successor.But Adams had a challenger - his good friend Jefferson.Adams emerged narrowly victorious in the contest Jefferson, the runner-up, became vice president.Adams finally had the job he wanted, but it came at a tough time.Britain and France were at war - and the young nation of America was facing an impossible choice in whom to back.The political parties were also divided between those who saw the French Revolution as the natural heir of the American Revolution and those who insisted the United States could not afford a war with Britain.Adams chose negotiations over conflict - a wise move but which doomed him politically.Jefferson would challenge Adams for the presidency yet again - and this time prevail.By now, the breach between the two men had widened.Adams became the first president not to attend the inauguration of his successor.In 1801, Adams left for home.However, the Adams and Jefferson relationship was not done.It was Adams who began the rapprochement with Jefferson in 1812.\"You and I ought not to die, before We have explained ourselves to each other,\" Adams wrote to his old friend.Adams and Jefferson would write over 150 letters to each other on a variety of subjects.The correspondence between the two founding fathers continues to fascinate historians to this day.On July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, Adams died.His last thoughts and his final words were about Jefferson.\"Thomas Jefferson survives,\" Adam whispered.He could not have known that Jefferson had already passed away in his beloved Monticello earlier that day.LegacyAdams only served one term as president - which, to modern eyes, is a sure sign of failure.But his navigation of US foreign policy in the Oval Office at a fraught time for the nation cannot be underestimated.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Over the past four years, judges at Washington's federal courthouse have punished hundreds of rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol in an unprecedented assault on the nation's democracy. On the cusp of the next presidential election, some of those judges fear another burst of political violence could be coming.Before recently sentencing a rioter to prison, U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton said he prays Americans accept the outcome of next month's election. But the veteran judge expressed concern that Donald Trump and his allies are spreading the same sort of conspiracy theories that fueled the mob's Jan. 6, 2021, riot.\"That sore loser is saying the same things he said before,\" Walton said earlier this month without mentioning the Republican presidential nominee by name. \"He's riling up the troops again, so if he doesn't get what he wants, it's not inconceivable that we will experience that same situation again. And who knows? It could be worse.\"Walton, a nominee of President George W. Bush, is not alone. Other judges have said the political climate is ripe for another attack like the one injured more than 100 police officers at the Capitol. As Election Day nears, judges are frequently stressing the need to send a message beyond their courtrooms that political violence can't be tolerated.\"It scares me to think about what will happen if anyone on either side is not happy with the results of the election,\" Judge Jia Cobb, a nominee of President Joe Biden, said during a sentencing hearing last month for four Capitol rioters.Judge Rudolph Contreras lamented the potential for more politically motivated violence as he sentenced a Colorado man, Jeffrey Sabol, who helped other rioters drag a police officer into the mob. Sabol later told FBI agents that a \"call to battle was announced\" and that he had \"answered the call because he was a patriot warrior.\"\"It doesn't take much imagination to imagine a similar call coming out in the coming months, and the court would be concerned that Mr. Sabol would answer that call in the same way,\" Contreras, a President Barack Obama nominee, said in March before sentencing Sabol to more than five years in prison.Trump's distortion of the Jan. 6 attack has been a cornerstone of his bid to reclaim the White House. The former president has denied any responsibility for the crimes of supporters who smashed windows, assaulted police officers and sent lawmakers running into hiding as they met to certify President Joe Biden's 2020 victory.Trump has vowed to pardon rioters, whom he calls \"patriots\" and \"hostages,\" if he wins in November. And he said he would accept the results of the upcoming election only if it's \"free and fair,\" casting doubts reminiscent of his baseless claims in 2020.Judges have repeatedly used their platform on the bench to denounce those efforts to downplay the violence on Jan. 6 and cast the rioters as political prisoners. And some have raised concerns about what such rhetoric means for the future of the country and its democracy.\"We're in a real difficult time in our country, and I hope we can survive it,\" Walton said this month while sentencing a Tennessee nurse who used a pair of medical scissors to smash a glass door at the Capitol.\"I've got a young daughter, I've got a young grandson, and I would like for America to be available to them and be as good to them as it has been to me,\" he added. \"But I don't know if we survive with the mentality that took place that day.\"More than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes related to Jan. 6 siege, which disrupted the peaceful transfer of presidential power for the first time in the nation's history. Over 1,000 rioters have been convicted and sentenced. Roughly 650 of them received prison time ranging from a few days to 22 years.Justice Department prosecutors have argued in many cases that a prison sentence is necessary to deter convicted Capitol rioters from engaging in more politically motivated violence.\"With the 2024 presidential election approaching and many loud voices in the media and online continuing to sow discord and distrust, the potential for a repeat of January 6 looms ominously,\" prosecutors have repeatedly warned in court filings.Prosecutors argue that defendants who have shown little or no remorse for their actions on Jan. 6 could break the law again. Some rioters even seem to be proud of their crimes.The first rioter to enter the Capitol texted his mother, \"I'll go again given the opportunity.\" A man from Washington state who stormed the Capitol with fellow Proud Boys extremist group members told a judge, \"You can give me 100 years and I'd do it all over again.\" A Kentucky nurse who joined the riot told a television interviewer that she would \"do it again tomorrow.\"A Colorado woman known to her social media followers as the \"J6 praying grandma\" avoided a prison sentence in August when a magistrate judge sentenced her for disorderly conduct and trespassing on Capitol grounds. Rebecca Lavrenz told the judge that God, not Trump, led her to Washington on Jan. 6.\"And she has all but promised to do it all over again,\" said prosecutor Terence Parker.Prosecutors had sought 10 months behind bars. After her April trial conviction, Lavrenz went on a \"media blitz\" to defend the mob, spread misinformation, undermine confidence in the courts and boost her celebrity in a community that believes Jan. 6 \"was a good day for this country,\" Parker said.Magistrate Zia Faruqui sentenced Lavrenz to six months of home confinement and fined her $103,000, stressing the need to \"lower the volume\" before the next election.\"These outside influences, the people that are tearing our country apart, they're not going to help you,\" Faruqui told her.",

Serrao acknowledged this, saying, \"The cookies can't predict the election.\"Nonetheless, the current sales figures may be an encouraging sign for Trump's campaign, as new polling from Rasmussen Reports shows him leading Harris by three points in Pennsylvania.The cookies at Oakmont Bakery have sparked conversations not only about the candidates but also about the state of the race itself. \"I think a lot of people are getting the candidate they are supporting,\" Sullivan remarked. \"But then there are some people that are just like, I'm going to get this candidate so I can chomp into them.\"As the election approaches, these cookies serve as a playful reminder of the contentious political climate and the passion voters have for their preferred candidates.With Trump and Harris both vying for votes in a key battleground state, the bakery's cookie sales could be seen as a reflection of the broader sentiment among Pennsylvania voters.As the campaign heats up, the unique approach of using cookies as a measure of political support will likely continue to draw attention, providing a fun and tasty way for locals to engage with the electoral process.The opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of LifeZette.

While Trump's proposals have been light on details, he has focused on healthcare costs by pledging to tackle insurance premiums, improve price transparency, and reduce surprise bills.\nHarris, meanwhile, has promised to extend the enhanced subsidies in the Affordable Care Act marketplace, cap insulin costs for all Medicare recipients -- not just seniors -- cancel medical debt, and expand Medicare to cover long-term care.Here's a rundown of some of the healthcare issues facing Americans, which make them relevant to the presidential race, and each campaign's stances when relevant.An estimated 20 million Americans collectively owe $220 billion in medical debt, according to the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker.In June, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced that it would erase medical debt from credit reports using funding from the American Rescue Plan.Harris has said in her economic plan that her administration would \"work with states to help them enter into agreements with hospitals and other health providers to relieve medical debt for more Americans, and help create plans to prevent debt accumulation in the future.\"Trump has not laid out a plan for tackling the issue.KFF found that among insured adults with medical debt, 35% indicated they did not fill a prescription for medicine due to cost within the last 12 months (compared to 7% of insured adults without medical debt), while 41% didn't go to a doctor or clinic for a medical problem due to cost (compared with 9% without medical debt).Wendell Potter, former Cigna executive and current president of the Center for Health and Democracy, noted that high out-of-pocket costs and other barriers make it difficult for people to get the care they need -- even if they have insurance.\"It's one thing, and laudable, to have 91%-92% of Americans covered,\" Potter said. \"You still have millions who don't have coverage, but the vast majority of people who have medical debt have insurance.\"In 2024, the average annual premium was $1,368 for single coverage and $6,296 for family coverage.For workers with single coverage in a plan with an annual deductible -- the amount of money a consumer pays for covered healthcare services before insurance kicks in -- the average annual deductible is $1,787. Family deductibles, meanwhile, range from $1,548 to $4,991, depending on the plan structure.While in office, Trump signed an executive order that required hospitals to disclose prices in a consumer-friendly format and insurers to show people what they can expect to pay for out-of-pocket non-emergency services through an online tool.In addition to high out-of-pocket costs, other insurance practices -- such as prior authorization, which requires provider approval for certain prescriptions or services -- can increase costs.An August 2024 survey from the Commonwealth Fund found that 55% of respondents between the ages of 19 and 64 reported not challenging a bill for a service that they thought should have been free or covered by their health insurance.According to Potter, it's \"baked into the system to take a long time\" because insurers know that consumers will often give up or their physicians have so many other prior authorizations that they won't focus on any one patient.\"It's gotten more difficult for physicians to practice and treat their patients ... because of the interference in various ways by insurance companies,\" he said.Trump has vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare, and replace it with something else. However, during his previous term in office, he and Republicans spearheaded multiple failed attempts to do so.Harris, meanwhile, has pledged to permanently expand the enhanced subsidies granted through the ACA, which the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services stated have saved most consumers at least $800 annually on premiums.Gideon Lukens, senior fellow and director of research for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told Yahoo Finance that a surge in marketplace enrollment since 2020 is likely due to these \"affordability improvements.\"Lukens said policymakers \"need to be aware\" that extending these tax credits is something that \"needs to happen as soon as possible\" to prevent premium spikes.\"I think the urgency for extending the enhanced premium tax credits is something that not everybody is aware of,\" he said.Medicaid expansion has been an ongoing issue since the implementation of the ACA.In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled to leave decisions up to states on whether to adopt the ACA's expansion, creating a \"coverage gap\" in the 10 states that still haven't expanded Medicaid. That translates to roughly 2 million individuals without healthcare coverage.A 2023 study published in Health Affairs found that states that adopted the Medicaid expansion were able to reduce uninsured rates and narrow racial and ethnic disparities in coverage.The current uninsured rate on a national level is 8.2%, or roughly 27.1 million people, as of Q1 '24. When broken down by racial/ethnic group, the uninsured rates vary widely: 26% of Hispanic/Latino Americans, 9.8% of Black Americans, 7.7% of white Americans, and 5.1% of Asian Americans.\"Not only have coverage gains from the enhanced premium tax credits increased coverage overall, but they've also reduced disparities and inequities,\" Lukens said.Another issue that Shafer, the Boston University professor, said is \"top of mind\" for many voters is reproductive health.\"Vice President Harris wants to restore Roe through legislation, while former President Trump failed to commit to vetoing a national abortion ban in their first decade,\" he said.Harris is a staunch supporter of abortion rights, particularly after the Roe v. Wade decision was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2022. Her campaign website states that as president, \"she will never allow a national abortion ban to become law. And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide, she will sign it.\"During his term as president, the Trump administration made several moves to limit access to abortion, including cutting federal funding from health centers that refer patients for abortions. Trump also appointed three Supreme Court justices who all voted in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade, a decision that he celebrated and even takes credit for.As a candidate this time around, Trump has attempted to strike a different tone on abortion. When a Florida ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy took effect earlier in 2024, Trump criticized the law -- but also opposed a state ballot measure to codify abortion rights in the state. He has been vocal about his support for IVF, even as members of his own party seek to limit access.Earlier this year, he posted a video on his Truth Social platform stating, \"My view is now that we have abortion where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land. In this case, the law of the state. At the end of the day, this is all about the will of the people. You must follow your heart or in many cases, your religion or your faith. Do what's right for your family and do what's right for yourself.\"--Adriana Belmonte is a reporter and editor covering politics and healthcare policy for Yahoo Finance.

With the election just weeks away, she has framed Trump's age and health as significant liabilities in the race for the White House.

Ashley Hinson defends her seat in Northeastern Iowa, the Republican incumbent has spent time on the campaign trail linking her candidacy with that of former President Donald Trump's 2024 run.Trump has endorsed her reelection campaign.\"Under President Trump we will secure the border. We will deport these dangerous illegals, and we will make America safe again. And that is a promise,\" she said to applause in August during her annual \"BBQ Bash\" fundraiser in Cedar Rapids.Hinson took aim at the Biden-Harris administration's gender equality rules in education. She praised Gov. Kim Reynolds and Republican state lawmakers for banning transgender athletes competing in girls sports at the high school and college levels, cutting taxes and passing a law -- since blocked in federal court -- that would allow Iowa law enforcement to arrest and charge noncitizens with a crime if they are in the state but have previously been blocked from entering the country or deported.

Here are coach Kevin Dresser's takeawaysThe two-term incumbent, who is seeking a third term, faces Democrat Sarah Corkery, 49, a breast cancer survivor, disability rights advocate and Cedar Falls small-business owner, in the Nov. 5 election for Iowa's 2nd Congressional District.Jody Puffett, 59, of Delhi, is running unaffiliated with a political party and also will appear on the ballot alongside Corkery and Hinson.Hinson, 41, of Marion, and her campaign seldom mention her Democratic opponent, focusing her messaging and attacks instead on the Democratic Biden-Harris administration.\"I think it goes without saying, but I believe my opponent would be lockstep with a Harris-Walz administration,\" Hinson told The Gazette of the Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\"... I'm out there telling that story, because this election is about a contrast\" between what she described as an unsecured U.S.-Mexico border, weakened U.S. foreign policy and global security, wasteful spending, and supporting a Trump administration focused on lowering taxes, boosting the economy and securing the Southern border.The former state lawmaker and former KCRG-TV news anchor flipped a blue seat red in 2020 by campaigning on kitchen-table issues and pledging to be a taxpayer advocate in Congress. Hinson won re-election in 2022 by 8 percentage points against Democratic former state lawmaker Liz Mathis of Hiawatha.This time, she faces vastly underfunded first-time candidates running grassroots campaigns.Corkery has focused her campaign on women's health care rights and public education. She regularly attacks Hinson for supporting legislation limiting women's ability to receive an abortion.The districtIowa's 2nd District encompasses 22 counties in Northeast Iowa, including Cedar Rapids, Waterloo, Cedar Falls and Dubuque. The race is expected to be less competitive than contests in the 1st and 3rd congressional districts that are also up for election.A Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll showed in September more likely Iowa voters preferred a Republican candidate over a Democrat in three of the state's four congressional districts, including the 2nd District.The independent, non-partisan Cook Political Report rates Iowa's 2nd District as a \"solid Republican\" R+4 district, meaning that in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, voters in the district supported Republican candidates an average of about 4 points more than the nation did as a whole.The latest figures from the Iowa Secretary of State's Office show there are nearly 150,000 active registered Republican voters, more than 127,000 active registered Democrats, nearly 130,000 active no-party voters, and 2,400 active registered Libertarians in the district.Hinson has a large fundraising advantage over Corkery. National Democrats have not targeted the race in the same way they have in the 1st and 3rd districts, leaving Corkery with little outside support.That has afforded Hinson the ability to crisscross the country and state to help boost other Republican candidates and position herself for a role among House Republican leadership should New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, one of the top GOP ranking leaders in Congress, be tapped to serve in a new Trump administration.The economyHinson, who sits on the House Appropriations Committee, said a priority is reducing inflation by slowing government growth and spending, reducing taxes and \"regulatory burdens\" on small businesses, and supporting targeted investments like airport expansion projects \"that helps to churn economic development and growth and investment all around The Eastern Iowa Airport.\"Hinson has blamed trillions in \"wasteful spending\" approved by Democrats in pandemic stimulus money, clean energy and climate mitigation investment programs for worsening inflation -- creating a surge of consumer spending that collided with supply problems to boost prices.She supports extending Trump-era tax cuts for small businesses, which are set to expire at the end of 2025. She also introduced legislation that would require federal departments and agencies to cut two existing rules for each new rule issued and offset any costs imposed by new rules while operating under a regulatory cost cap.ImmigrationSecuring the Southern border is another of Hinson's priorities. She said the federal government's top priority on border security needs to be to \"deport the dangerous illegals in this country\" and secure the border by working with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement before focusing on reforming the immigration and visa systems.\"Well, I agree the immigration system in this country is broken, but what has happened under the Biden-Harris administration is unacceptable and it's unsafe,\" Hinson told The Gazette, citing reports that border-crossers with terrorist ties were released into the United States before they were later arrested.\"Not to mention the strain that 10 million-plus illegal immigrants puts on our country and our services. And I think that's I think that's wrong,\" she said.During a debate last Monday on Iowa PBS, she spoke about seeing the impacts of immigration and illegal border crossings on Iowa communities, pointing to anecdotes about higher rates of people who do not speak English requesting translation or English education services.Trump has said he would invoke emergency wartime powers, activate military reservists and rely on the support of like-minded Republican governors to carry out the largest mass deportation of undocumented migrants in U.S. history.Hinson said she supports mass deportation measures through coordinated efforts with ICE. However, that can't be done without more support at the federal level.\"We need to allow and empower ICE to do their job, because this is a problem that is truly affecting the American economy and American communities. Every community is a border community right now,\" Hinson said during last week's debate.Corkery argued that Hinson should have supported a bipartisan plan in the U.S. Senate to secure the border that was thwarted by Trump and his supporters. The deal called for increased funding for detention beds, Border Patrol agents, asylum officers and immigration judges. It would also reinforce new restrictions on migrants seeking asylum, and other reforms.Hinson supported a 2023 House GOP-led measureto increase border security -- a separate measure from the bipartisan deal. It would end the practice of \"catch and release,\" in which Border Patrol agents release migrants into the United States while they await immigration hearings, and impose new limits to asylum eligibility.Hinson said she opposed the Senate deal because it would not mandate a border closure until Border Patrol reached a seven-day average of 5,000 or more border encounters, or if the number exceeded 8,500 in a single day.She also noted her support of an appropriations bill that includes funding for drone technology and automated surveillance towers to act as a force multiplier to aid Border Patrol.Abortion and IVFHinson has been a proponent of Iowa's current law banning abortion as early as six weeks into pregnancy after cardiac activity is detected. The law includes limited exceptions for some cases of rape and incest, to protect life or health of the mother, or a fetal abnormality judged by a doctor to be incompatible with life.She said she would not support a nationwide abortion ban at the federal level without those exceptions. However, in January, she cosponsored the Life at Conception Act, which would establish legal protections for fetuses and embryos at \"the moment of fertilization,\" and guarantee a \"right to life\" for every human being.While the bill -- which never made it to the House floor -- does not specifically mention abortion, critics say it would undoubtedly restrict the medical procedure as well as in vitro fertilization. The bill does not spell out protections for fertility treatments or exceptions for cases involving rape, incest or to save the life of the mother.Hinson said she would not vote for the bill as it's now written because it does not contain those exceptions, and noted her efforts in the appropriations process to provide more IVF access to government workers.\"I support policies that are going to help protect life and help people grow their families first and foremost,\" Hinson told The Gazette. \"... So what I said earlier about supporting exceptions for rape, incest, life of the mother, fetal anomaly, I would want to make sure that the same protections exist for IVF ... before it would get a vote on the floor from me.\"Foreign policyAsked whether she would continue to support aid to Ukraine while a sizable portion of her party would not, Hinson noted she's supported some foreign aid packages and opposed others.She said her biggest concern is that she does not want American troops fighting Russia in Ukraine.\"I believe in America first, but not America alone,\" Hinson said.During the debate, she said Russian President Vladimir Putin is a \"thug\" who \"cannot be allowed to win this war.\" She also told The Gazette the United States needs to stand with its allies in Israel \"and make sure they have the resources they need.\"BipartisanshipHinson's latest TV ad aired last week. It portrays the sophomore congresswoman as willing to work on bipartisan issues. The ad features Iowans who say they support Hinson because of her \"bipartisan record of results.\"She has partnered with Democrats to co-sponsor and pass various forms of legislation, including the Maternal and Child Health Stillbirth Prevention Act and Sgt. Ketchum Rural Veterans Mental Health Act signed into law by President Joe Biden.Corkery and Iowa Democrats, however, note Hinson voted against the bipartisan infrastructure law and capping the price of insulin.Hinson has said government price controls ultimately will raise premiums for Americans. Instead, she said she favors another bill with several bipartisan provisions that would cap out-of-pocket insulin costs for seniors on Medicare Part D, allow high-deductible plans to cover insulin costs before the deductible kicks in, increase transparency for patients and promote health care innovation.Hinson has said she opposed the infrastructure bill because of its large price tag, and has advocated for and helped secure funding for targeted infrastructure updates and various projects in the district.The Republican incumbent has also highlighted her work to expand access to maternal care for women in rural areas, expand the child tax credit for working families, provide additional resources for expecting mothers and support young families.\"I think if you look at my record of success for Iowans, I have continued to deliver even in divided government,\" Hinson said.\"... I've stood up against an administration that I think has a incessant desire to spend money and eventually raise taxes in the (Inflation Reduction Act). ... So I will continue to be an advocate for Iowa taxpayers, an advocate for rural America and an advocate for safety and security in our communities.\"Economic factors and currency volatility in the 2024 US presidential election Economic factors and currency volatility in the 2024 US presidential election Who is Ashley Hinson?Age: 41Party: RepublicanTown of residence: MarionOccupation: Member of the U.S. House and former journalist/news anchorPolitical experience: Hinson served in the Iowa House from 2017 to 2021.

Or maybe vote by mail? It helps to know the rules.There was no evidence of widespread fraud or rigged voting machines in the election, and multiple reviews in the battleground states where the Republican president disputed his loss to Democrat Joe Biden confirmed the results as accurate. In 2023, Fox News agreed to pay Dominion Voting Systems, one of the largest voting machine companies, $787 million to avoid a trial in a defamation lawsuit.In the years since his loss, Trump and his allies have continued to sow doubts about voting equipment. State and local election officials have tried to push back by explaining the layers of protection that surround voting systems and the measures they have in place to conduct fair and accurate elections.People are also reading...

Every office does things a little bit differently.Officials rely on a voter registration system that is a database of registered voters and have an election management system that workers use to create, issue and track ballots. They also use an election-night reporting system that reports unofficial results. Many jurisdictions use electronic pollbooks to check in voters at polling locations.How voting before Election Day became so widespread and so politicalRoughly 50 years ago, about 95% of voters cast their ballots in person on Election Day. That number has fallen gradually as states have provided Americans with more options.All of this depends on software and computers, a reliance that carries risks that officials work to identify and address. For example, election officials often will isolate critical systems from the internet and use storage devices, such as secured USB sticks, to transfer data. They limit access to sensitive equipment to only those who need it and have logs that track and monitor the devices.When an internet connection is needed, election officials often will use private networks to limit the risk of malicious activity and take other steps to scan their systems for potential vulnerabilities and threats.Voters in much of the country fill out ballots by hand, and then that ballot will be scanned and counted electronically. A few places, mostly small towns in the Northeast, will count their ballots by hand.In some areas, voters use a computer to mark their ballots electronically and then get a printout of their choices that they insert into a scanner for counting. In other cases, the ballot is cast electronically, and a paper record is printed that summarizes the votes cast. That record is then available if a hand-count is needed.Are voting machines connected to the internet?With a few exceptions, no. There are some jurisdictions in a few states that allow for ballot scanners in polling locations to transmit unofficial results, using a mobile private network, after voting has ended on Election Day and the memory cards containing the vote tallies have been removed.Listen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our PodcastsElection officials who allow this say it provides for faster reporting of unofficial election results on election night. They say the paper records of the ballots cast are used to authenticate the results during postelection reviews, and that those records would be crucial to a recount if one were needed.Computer security experts have said this is an unnecessary risk and should be prohibited.Are voting machines secure?Election officials say they have worked extensively to shore up security around their voting equipment after an effort by Russia to scan state voter registration systems for vulnerabilities in 2016.There was no evidence then that data was changed or deleted, but it led the federal government to declare the nation's election systems as critical infrastructure. That allows the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to provide free cybersecurity reviews and vulnerability testing to election offices nationwide.Elections Top 25: The people, places, races, dates and things to knowIt can be tough to make sense of everything before Election Day, so here's a guidebook, of sorts, to American democracy as it nears its 250th birthday.\"Today, eight years later, because of all the incredible work by election officials to strengthen the security and resiliency of our election process, election infrastructure has never been more secure, and the election stakeholder community has never been stronger,\" the agency's director, Jen Easterly, told reporters in September.Computer security experts have called for more to be done and for election officials to limit the use of certain technology, specifically machines that mark ballots for voters. A long-running court battle in Georgia has sought to compel the state to get rid of these machines in favor of hand-marked paper ballots.Experts have also raised particular concern about a series of security breaches that occurred after the 2020 election as Trump allies sought access to voting systems in Georgia and elsewhere as they tried to prove their unsubstantiated claims.

    "content": "Voting machines have been at the center of a web of conspiracy theories after the 2020 election, with false claims that they were manipulated to steal the presidency from Donald Trump.Who can vote in this year's elections, and what steps must you take to do so?So you want to cast a ballot on Election Day? Or maybe vote by mail? It helps to know the rules.There was no evidence of widespread fraud or rigged voting machines in the election, and multiple reviews in the battleground states where the Republican president disputed his loss to Democrat Joe Biden confirmed the results as accurate. In 2023, Fox News agreed to pay Dominion Voting Systems, one of the largest voting machine companies, $787 million to avoid a trial in a defamation lawsuit.In the years since his loss, Trump and his allies have continued to sow doubts about voting equipment. State and local election officials have tried to push back by explaining the layers of protection that surround voting systems and the measures they have in place to conduct fair and accurate elections.People are also reading...

Every office does things a little bit differently.Officials rely on a voter registration system that is a database of registered voters and have an election management system that workers use to create, issue and track ballots. They also use an election-night reporting system that reports unofficial results. Many jurisdictions use electronic pollbooks to check in voters at polling locations.How voting before Election Day became so widespread and so politicalRoughly 50 years ago, about 95% of voters cast their ballots in person on Election Day. That number has fallen gradually as states have provided Americans with more options.All of this depends on software and computers, a reliance that carries risks that officials work to identify and address. For example, election officials often will isolate critical systems from the internet and use storage devices, such as secured USB sticks, to transfer data. They limit access to sensitive equipment to only those who need it and have logs that track and monitor the devices.When an internet connection is needed, election officials often will use private networks to limit the risk of malicious activity and take other steps to scan their systems for potential vulnerabilities and threats.Voters in much of the country fill out ballots by hand, and then that ballot will be scanned and counted electronically. A few places, mostly small towns in the Northeast, will count their ballots by hand.In some areas, voters use a computer to mark their ballots electronically and then get a printout of their choices that they insert into a scanner for counting. In other cases, the ballot is cast electronically, and a paper record is printed that summarizes the votes cast. That record is then available if a hand-count is needed.Are voting machines connected to the internet?With a few exceptions, no. There are some jurisdictions in a few states that allow for ballot scanners in polling locations to transmit unofficial results, using a mobile private network, after voting has ended on Election Day and the memory cards containing the vote tallies have been removed.Listen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our PodcastsElection officials who allow this say it provides for faster reporting of unofficial election results on election night. They say the paper records of the ballots cast are used to authenticate the results during postelection reviews, and that those records would be crucial to a recount if one were needed.Computer security experts have said this is an unnecessary risk and should be prohibited.Are voting machines secure?Election officials say they have worked extensively to shore up security around their voting equipment after an effort by Russia to scan state voter registration systems for vulnerabilities in 2016.There was no evidence then that data was changed or deleted, but it led the federal government to declare the nation's election systems as critical infrastructure. That allows the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to provide free cybersecurity reviews and vulnerability testing to election offices nationwide.Elections Top 25: The people, places, races, dates and things to knowIt can be tough to make sense of everything before Election Day, so here's a guidebook, of sorts, to American democracy as it nears its 250th birthday.\"Today, eight years later, because of all the incredible work by election officials to strengthen the security and resiliency of our election process, election infrastructure has never been more secure, and the election stakeholder community has never been stronger,\" the agency's director, Jen Easterly, told reporters in September.Computer security experts have called for more to be done and for election officials to limit the use of certain technology, specifically machines that mark ballots for voters. A long-running court battle in Georgia has sought to compel the state to get rid of these machines in favor of hand-marked paper ballots.Experts have also raised particular concern about a series of security breaches that occurred after the 2020 election as Trump allies sought access to voting systems in Georgia and elsewhere as they tried to prove their unsubstantiated claims. The experts have warned that the public release of critical election software because of the breaches has raised \"serious threats\" and have called for a federal investigation.How do election officials ensure accuracy?Election officials say there are safeguards in place to ensure that voting systems are not manipulated.

    "title": "3 Big Changes That Could Be Coming For Cryptocurrency in 2025 | The Motley Fool",
    "content": "The 2024 presidential election could set big changes for the crypto industry into motion.2024 has already been a watershed year for the crypto industry, thanks to the launch of the new spot Bitcoin (BTC 0.50%) ETFs in January. For the first time ever, both individual and institutional investors have a quick, easy, and regulator-approved way to get direct exposure to Bitcoin without entering the cryptocurrency market through a crypto-trading brokerage.But there could be even bigger changes ahead in 2025. Many, of course, will be the result of the 2024 presidential election, which has seen crypto introduced as a political campaign issue for the first time ever. Here are three big changes on the horizon, ranked from most likely to least likely to occur.The new spot Bitcoin ETFs have surpassed all expectations, bringing in more than $30 billion of investor capital. Yes, there was a brief rough patch in August, when it looked like investor inflows would dry up. But inflows are now back on a bullish pace, and these ETFs are being accepted by everyone from the smallest retail investor to the biggest billionaire hedge fund manager.Thus, the introduction of more crypto ETFs in 2025 is almost a no-brainer. July saw the launch of new spot Ethereum (ETH 0.68%) ETFs, and the current expectation is that a handful of other large market-cap cryptocurrencies could be next. The most likely prospects include Solana and XRP, both of which rank among the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies.Currently, the United States lacks a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto, but that could be changing in 2025. Both Republicans and Democrats agree that such a framework is needed, and political momentum seems to be building for an overhaul next year.Right now, the system for regulating crypto is unclear and, at times, unfair. This is a point that cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global (COIN 7.84%) has argued over and over again, as it has been pulled into regulatory battles with the SEC. Keep in mind: The current system for regulating crypto is based on a 1946 Supreme Court case that was originally designed to settle a dispute over Florida citrus groves. It's getting harder and harder to see how these ancient rules apply to modern business issues.Thus, 2025 could see the introduction of new legislation that clearly spells out how crypto should be regulated, as well as who should be regulating it. Right now, the SEC is the primary regulator, but the current thinking among pro-crypto advocates is that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) should be in charge. At the very least, look for the replacement of SEC head Gary Gensler in 2025 with someone with a more pro-crypto attitude.Bitcoin could become a new strategic imperative for the U.S. government in 2025. Already, there are calls for greater government support for the Bitcoin mining industry, as well as suggestions that the U.S. might be pulled into a Bitcoin \"arms race\" with the likes of China and Russia.Some politicians have even suggested that Bitcoin could become part of a solution to the $35 trillion national debt problem. The logic here is very simple: As long as Bitcoin can increase in price faster than the national debt can grow in size, there might be a chance to pay off all this debt one day. Granted, it's going to be tough sledding, given that the U.S. debt is growing by $1 trillion every 100 days. By way of comparison, that's equivalent to the total market cap of Bitcoin right now.As part of a potential solution, U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyoming) has already introduced legislation for a strategic Bitcoin reserve that is based on the idea of buying 1 million BTC over a period of several years. Over time, part of that reserve could theoretically be used to pay down debt.Granted, the chances of any of this happening are directly tied to the electoral success of Donald Trump, who claims to be the first pro-Bitcoin president in history. He has already said that he wants to make America the \"crypto capital of the planet.\" For some people, this might sound terrifying. But for crypto investors, it could be a dream come true.The big question facing investors in 2025 is how to position a portfolio to take advantage of these potential changes. The simplest solution, of course, is to load up on Bitcoin. Much of the political and regulatory focus seems to be on Bitcoin, which still accounts for more than one-half of the market cap of the entire crypto market. So any change to crypto is going to have an effect, first and foremost, on Bitcoin.The real-world effect of any new crypto legislation is harder to predict. A clue here might come from other nations attempting to enact new crypto legislation. For example, the European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation will go into full effect in December. This will establish a comprehensive legal framework for the issuance, investment, and trading of crypto assets across the EU.For now, keep an eye on the 2024 presidential election. The outcome there could have a huge effect on the crypto market for years to come. If there's a big post-election rally, you can be confident that big changes will be coming for crypto in 2025.",

    "content": "Former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown voiced strong support for former President Donald Trump during a rally in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, asserting that Trump embodies the values of hard work and loyalty.Speaking to a crowd at Arnold Palmer Regional Airport, Brown reflected on his time with the Steelers and how he learned to represent the \"blue-collar, hardworking people\" of Pittsburgh.He emphasized that his journey from being a sixth-round draft pick to a celebrated NFL star taught him the importance of resilience and dedication. \"I came to Pittsburgh as a sixth-round draft pick and underdog, but the people in the city really embraced me. They knew what it was like to be an underdog,\" Brown stated. \"My time here taught me to embody the spirit of Pittsburgh, a blue-collar, hardworking people, that are resilient and face challenges head-on.\"FREE Trump Fighting For America Gold Coin - Fight Fight Fight!Brown noted that he was \"blessed to be surrounded\" by values such as loyalty and hard work, which he said he carried with him onto the football field.He continued by expressing his admiration for Trump, saying, \"I'm here today, repping a man -- representing a man who carries those same values, Donald Trump.\"He further praised Trump for his understanding of success and his commitment to making America great again.During his remarks, Brown acknowledged that everyone experiences \"highs and lows\" in life, including his own career as a Super Bowl champion and his role as a father to seven children.He pointed out that Trump, too, has faced adversity throughout his life, despite the challenges posed by the media and political opponents. \"And, to be real, we all got to experience highs and lows, especially me and my career as a SuperBowl champion. I have experienced low points and have to overcome adversity just how it was,\" Brown said. \"Donald Trump overcame adversity. No matter what the media threw at him, no matter what people say to try to bring him down, he continued to push forward and keep getting back up.\"Brown declared that Trump believes in the potential for greatness within the United States, further stating, \"We all need to possess courage and keep pushing forward to bring a better future.\" He rallied the crowd by declaring support for Trump, stating, \"Speaking of pushing forward in a better future, we are here to support our 45th president, soon to be the 47th president, Donald J. Trump.\"He emphasized that Trump embodies the values instilled in him by the city of Pittsburgh and that, under Trump's leadership, America could achieve greatness.This is not the first time Brown has expressed his support for Trump.In May, he remarked that Trump was \"a good businessman\" and had been \"a good president,\" highlighting the former president's positive impact on individuals such as Lil Wayne and Kodak Black.As the 2024 presidential election approaches, Trump continues to garner support from various public figures, with Brown's endorsement reinforcing the former president's connection to the working-class demographic in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state.The opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of Objectivist.

    "title": "MARK HALPERIN: Kamala battles to regain momentum after late-summer swoon",
    "content": "'The Story' panelists Lisa Boothe and Mark Penn unpack 2024 presidential election polling.Before she became her party's nominee for president, Kamala Harris had not made a substantial, discernable positive public impact during her nearly four years in the White House. She largely operated under the radar and fell short regarding some of her most high-profile assignments.She had not universally distinguished herself as a leader. She had not won over swaths of new fans. She had not fully earned her place as next in line. She was known more in Washington circles for her rocky relationships with her staff members and her sagging approval ratings than for anything she had actually accomplished.HARRIS STRUGGLES TO NAME 'ONE POLICY' DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HER AND BIDENTo be sure, through the first few years of the Biden-Harris administration, the vice president received praise for assuming an outsize role in the fights for abortion and voting rights, and for building solid relationships with important foreign allies. Although mocked for her word salads and piercing guffaws, she did not overtly undercut the administration's agenda. For those who saw her up close, she was impressive but not iconic, charismatic but not yet a superstar.And on July 21, when Joe Biden stepped aside and Harris stepped in, she was good enough. Democrats and Never Trumpers had said it time and again. They just wanted someone healthy. Someone normal. Someone sane. Someone different. Someone not Biden, someone not Trump. Someone else.I would vote for any functioning politician over Biden and Trump.I would vote for that squirrel in that tree over Trump.There's no such thing as a perfect candidate.The country needs to turn the page on tired, wacky, old men.On that sticky summer Sunday afternoon when Biden announced his decision to drop out of the presidential race and endorsed his number two to be the Democratic nominee for president, no one, not even Harris herself, knew what was going to happen.A collective derecho-sized sigh of relief rose up from Democrats coast to coast, north to south, and every Blue enclave in between.President Biden's disastrous June debate performance had exposed the extent of his decline and put a glaring and unequivocal spotlight on his limitations as a candidate and as a prospective second-term president. Democratic voters and staunch party loyalists, Trump detractors, Trump loathers, and Trump Derangement Syndrome sufferers had all feared the worst: They were stuck with an acuity-compromised octogenarian who could not deliver the votes and would surely lose the election. And then, their unthinkable, impossible nightmare would occur -- Donald Trump would return to the White House.After several weeks of party pressure and serpentine political machinations the likes of which have rarely been seen in this country, Biden agreed to withdraw his reelection bid. Bypassing a Democratic Party nomination fight, he handed the torch to Harris. In a statement, Biden asserted that bringing in Harris as his vice president was \"the best decision I've made,\" and offered \"my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year.\"\"Democrats,\" he added, \"it's time to come together and beat Trump.\"This vigorous affirmation was standard but phony. Biden and his team, even members of the vice president's office, had long thought Harris was not yet prepared to be president, and would be a weak candidate against Trump, maybe a doomed one. Some White House staff clung to the belief that Biden, with all his visible infirmity, remained the less risky option. Regarding their long-held view of Harris, they were as certain as they were worried.Once Harris accepted the mantle from Biden, she seemingly became a political supernova overnight. She expanded, she leaned in, she improved. She showed charm and grit, confidence and swagger, grace and guts. She was, for the imperatives of the moment, great.Democrats, once despondent over candidate Biden, now cheered as loudly as they had exhaled. The Dominant Media was euphoric -- a fantastic story to cover, a Democratic heroine to bolster. The newspaper headlines and cable pontification surged beyond mere hagiography and well into farce. The blinders were firmly in place. The buzz words of summer were vibe shift and joy, and, of course, brat.Harris chose a running mate lickety-split, selecting Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz after a drastically abbreviated vetting process, and pulled off a strong convention in Chicago, which managed to be both dignified and buoyant. Harris was in command. Her polls were competitive, her fundraising boffo.But vibes can't sustain a presidential campaign, and supernovas, no matter how luminous and intense the explosion, fade within a few weeks. When the glow dissipated, voters were left with the same Kamala Harris they had before, the same Kamala Harris that always had been, the one about whom there were substantial doubts in her own camp.That Kamala Harris had no clear theory of the case for winning the race or governing, nor tested presidential-level skills. Reality set in. She began to stall.By Labor Day, the brat summer had largely evaporated. The mood shift, it turned out, was not a national phenomenon at all, but rather a instinctive and manic reaction from the Democratic base.By Labor Day, the brat summer had largely evaporated. The mood shift, it turned out, was not a national phenomenon at all, but rather a instinctive and manic reaction from the Democratic base.Independents, double haters, and undecided voters, meanwhile, had taken a pause and paid attention, waiting to learn more about Harris' positions and policy plans. But Harris didn't set forth a rationale for her presidency, beyond blocking a second Trump term. By Labor Day, Harris had not challenged herself by sitting for a tough interview, nor offered consistent straight answers about her intentions once in office, nor reached out to Red America. She had not risked the customary \"What my party has gotten wrong\" concession on anything, eschewing a way to show boldness and political self-awareness which every elected president since Bill Clinton had made a core part of their pitch.Harris supporters enjoyed a fresh burst of adrenaline on Sept. 9 when Harris and Trump faced off in the presidential debate. Harris was performatively strong, but the debate ironically only highlighted her fundamental problem. She looked and sounded good, appeared relaxed and unflinching, and brilliantly manipulated Trump's ego, but in front of a huge audience of engaged citizens, she neglected to hammer any hard facts or clarify her own agenda. It was a chillingly short-sighted example of style over substance, and an egregious wasted opportunity.It was time for Harris to stop coasting on vibes and parables and start doing the work.But could she?Her professional history indicated that the arduous task of crafting a message and headlining a full-blown campaign might be an uphill climb. Biden and many White House operatives still feared Harris could not beat Trump, and their failed efforts to prepare her both for the presidency and the race remained still fresh in their minds.Even those with short memories know that Harris had not in the past shown she was adept at assembling the basic building blocks of a viable national candidacy. During her extensive and prominent career in California, Harris made as many foes as friends, with a significant number of local Democrats, both political operatives and regular citizens, declining to support her enthusiastically or, in some cases, under any circumstances.Nor had Harris been a particularly distinguished or popular member of the Senate, unable to impress many colleagues on either side of the aisle. Indeed, some of her biggest detractors to date have been fellow senators who worked with her in the Capitol, although to be fair, she barely had time to establish herself in the position before moving out and up to the vice presidency.The presidential bid she launched in January 2019 ended before the year was up; she failed to convey a winning message or gain any traction, and she ran out of money before a single ballot was cast. Postmortems on her campaign emphasized her apparent lack of decisiveness, authenticity, direction, and guiding principles.CNN DATA EXPERT SAYS HARRIS' MOMENTUM HAS 'STALLED' WHILE TRUMP IS MORE POPULAR THAN IN PAST ELECTIONSThe various criticisms that have threaded throughout Harris' professional rise are intertwined with the weak filaments of her current campaign. For most of the fall, it has been difficult for her to drive a message. She has struggled to produce a winning soundbite from an interview or rally. Despite a freshly honed oratorical style, Harris has been too vague and cautious in her rhetoric to spark a crystallizing moment, a revelation of the soul. Her travel schedule for almost the entirety of the campaign has been curiously light, with few rallies, no coast-to-coast blitzes, and a lack of interconnection within her organization, the calendar and the polls.The feeling remains strong, even among some Democrats who desperately want her to win, that the Harris who was on offer before her ascendancy to the nomination is the one too often on display now. These Democrats see someone who is living in the moment rather than rising to the occasion.If Harris loses on Nov. 5, it should be no surprise to anyone who has watched her political path these past several decades. The signs were all there.However, if Harris triumphs, sending Donald Trump once and for all into political retirement, at this point, it will be something somewhat short of a shock.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONWith less than three weeks to go, Harris is demonstrating new signs of life, hitting her stride and having more fun. Her latest anti-Trump tagline -- unhinged, unstable, and unchecked -- seems to have some resonance. She is emitting refreshing flashes of authenticity, as she pivots from something in which her heart seems divided (shredding her previously held liberal positions) to something she relishes (cheeky denunciations of Trump's fitness for office).Democrats are fired up, and the country is primed for a reset. Harris has millions of supporters who are champing to vote for her, and not merely because they dislike Trump, or want to cast a ballot for a woman, or are true-blue Democrats. These citizens are voting for Harris herself now, because they have an appreciation for her accomplishments. Harris' resume has always been solid and hard-earned -- one must demonstrate true skill, stamina, and determination to become a United States senator and vice president. Despite the odd confluence of events that presented her with the Democratic nomination, Harris is now holding her own, in it to be sure, and with the potential to win it.\nEven as the country hurtles towards Election Day, Harris still has time to meld her summer vibes with the steely gladiator focus that was on display this past week. Going up against Trump, one of the most formidable, most original, most agile campaigners of the modern era, is no simple feat. Among every other variable at issue in presidential campaigns, candidate quality matters a lot, perhaps most of all.And no one ever said that winning the White House would be easy, even for a candidate - especially for a candidate, perhaps - who was given her party's nomination without a fight.",

    "title": "3 Big Changes That Could Be Coming For Cryptocurrency in 2025",
    "content": "2024 has already been a watershed year for the crypto industry, thanks to the launch of the new spot Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) ETFs in January. For the first time ever, both individual and institutional investors have a quick, easy, and regulator-approved way to get direct exposure to Bitcoin without entering the cryptocurrency market through a crypto-trading brokerage.But there could be even bigger changes ahead in 2025. Many, of course, will be the result of the 2024 presidential election, which has seen crypto introduced as a political campaign issue for the first time ever. Here are three big changes on the horizon, ranked from most likely to least likely to occur.More crypto ETFsThe new spot Bitcoin ETFs have surpassed all expectations, bringing in more than $30 billion of investor capital. Yes, there was a brief rough patch in August, when it looked like investor inflows would dry up. But inflows are now back on a bullish pace, and these ETFs are being accepted by everyone from the smallest retail investor to the biggest billionaire hedge fund manager.Thus, the introduction of more crypto ETFs in 2025 is almost a no-brainer. July saw the launch of new spot Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) ETFs, and the current expectation is that a handful of other large market-cap cryptocurrencies could be next. The most likely prospects include Solana and XRP, both of which rank among the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies.A change in how crypto is regulatedCurrently, the United States lacks a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto, but that could be changing in 2025. Both Republicans and Democrats agree that such a framework is needed, and political momentum seems to be building for an overhaul next year.Right now, the system for regulating crypto is unclear and, at times, unfair. This is a point that cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN) has argued over and over again, as it has been pulled into regulatory battles with the SEC. Keep in mind: The current system for regulating crypto is based on a 1946 Supreme Court case that was originally designed to settle a dispute over Florida citrus groves. It's getting harder and harder to see how these ancient rules apply to modern business issues.Thus, 2025 could see the introduction of new legislation that clearly spells out how crypto should be regulated, as well as who should be regulating it. Right now, the SEC is the primary regulator, but the current thinking among pro-crypto advocates is that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) should be in charge. At the very least, look for the replacement of SEC head Gary Gensler in 2025 with someone with a more pro-crypto attitude.Bitcoin as a national strategic imperativeBitcoin could become a new strategic imperative for the U.S. government in 2025. Already, there are calls for greater government support for the Bitcoin mining industry, as well as suggestions that the U.S. might be pulled into a Bitcoin \"arms race\" with the likes of China and Russia.Image source: Getty Images.Some politicians have even suggested that Bitcoin could become part of a solution to the $35 trillion national debt problem. The logic here is very simple: As long as Bitcoin can increase in price faster than the national debt can grow in size, there might be a chance to pay off all this debt one day. Granted, it's going to be tough sledding, given that the U.S. debt is growing by $1 trillion every 100 days. By way of comparison, that's equivalent to the total market cap of Bitcoin right now.As part of a potential solution, U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyoming) has already introduced legislation for a strategic Bitcoin reserve that is based on the idea of buying 1 million BTC over a period of several years. Over time, part of that reserve could theoretically be used to pay down debt.Granted, the chances of any of this happening are directly tied to the electoral success of Donald Trump, who claims to be the first pro-Bitcoin president in history. He has already said that he wants to make America the \"crypto capital of the planet.\" For some people, this might sound terrifying. But for crypto investors, it could be a dream come true.How to profit from changes to cryptoThe big question facing investors in 2025 is how to position a portfolio to take advantage of these potential changes. The simplest solution, of course, is to load up on Bitcoin. Much of the political and regulatory focus seems to be on Bitcoin, which still accounts for more than one-half of the market cap of the entire crypto market. So any change to crypto is going to have an effect, first and foremost, on Bitcoin.The real-world effect of any new crypto legislation is harder to predict. A clue here might come from other nations attempting to enact new crypto legislation. For example, the European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation will go into full effect in December. This will establish a comprehensive legal framework for the issuance, investment, and trading of crypto assets across the EU.For now, keep an eye on the 2024 presidential election. The outcome there could have a huge effect on the crypto market for years to come. If there's a big post-election rally, you can be confident that big changes will be coming for crypto in 2025.Don't miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you'll want to hear this.On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \"Double Down\" stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you're worried you've already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it's too late.

    "title": "3 signs Bitcoin's 'parabolic phase' with a $250K target is about to begin",
    "content": "Bitcoin's BTC $68,374 price has climbed 55% so far in 2024, including 12.50% gains in October. Its recent increases have been fueled by an overall improving risk-on sentiment led by better-than-expected Wall Street earnings.Additionally, investors are increasingly pricing in potential Federal Reserve rate cuts in November, with pro-crypto Donald Trump's rising odds of winning the 2024 presidential election furthering the optimism.Related: Anthony Pompliano reveals key catalysts for next Bitcoin bull runFundamentally, Bitcoin appears well-positioned to enter a bull run cycle for the remainder of 2024 and beyond. Meanwhile, certain technical and onchain indicators suggest a similar upside outlook.Bitcoin price will hit $100K in 2025, fractal suggestsThe first signs of Bitcoin entering a new bull cycle come from its two-month logarithmic chart, which independent market analyst Coosh Alemzadeh shared on X.The chart marks Bitcoin's historical bullish phases, such as the 60x increase from around 2011, a 20x increase in 2017, and a 6x increase during the 2020-2021 bull run.These phases follow a pattern in which Bitcoin's price first consolidates before a big, almost vertical rally occurs.As of October 2024, Bitcoin was exhibiting signs of breaking out of its prolonged consolidation phase, which often signals the start of a bull run within the parabolic channel marked by two red dashed lines.Market analyst Ted Pillows echoed this sentiment, highlighting a similar breakout from Bitcoin's consolidation channel.He argues that Bitcoin's \"parabolic phase\" has started, aligning with historical patterns of rapid price acceleration.Alemzadeh's fractal analysis predicts that Bitcoin will rise above $100,000 in 2025 and $250,000 in the long term.Bitcoin whale data shows pre-COVID rally behaviorAnother bullish sign for Bitcoin comes from its onchain data tracking whale activity on spot exchanges.The \"Exchange Whale Ratio,\" represented by the 30-day moving average, currently mirrors patterns last observed in 2020 after the COVID-19 crash. In that instance, whales aggressively accumulated Bitcoin, which preceded the massive bull run that took Bitcoin to new all-time highs by the end of 2021.As of October 2024, a similar whale accumulation pattern suggests that large holders are positioning themselves for potential price gains, with CryptoQuant analyst Woominkyu noting:\"They  could be positioning themselves to benefit from the potential long-term price increase after the next Bitcoin halving.\"Stablecoin dominance is decliningThe third indicator focuses on stablecoin dominance. Market analyst Doctor Magic points out that the dominance of stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and DAI has steadily declined since mid-2024.Historically, when capital starts to rotate out of stablecoins, it has been a precursor to massive price increases across the top-ranking cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, as shown below.In other words, the decline in stablecoin dominance suggests that investors anticipate Bitcoin to appreciate in value vs. the US dollar, reflecting a growing risk appetite and confidence in the market.If this trend continues, it could be a powerful confirmation that Bitcoin's parabolic phase is beginning as more liquidity flows back into BTC, driving its price higher.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "content": "Chief Justice Gertrude Torkornoo and Parliamentary Speaker Alban BagbinRenowned Ghanaian lawyer Kwame Boafo Akuffo may be trading pointless pointless blows with himself, according to an old friend from our PERSCO Days and a top-notch University of Ghana and University of Michigan Law Schools Graduate whose legal opinion regarding the question of whether, indeed, the Torkornoo Court egregiously erred in promptly deciding to put a \"Stay of Execution\" order on the hotheaded decision by the National Democratic Congress-sponsored Speaker of Ghana's Parliament, Mr. Alban Sumana Kingsford Bagbin, to declare the seats of some four Members of Parliament who have declared by filing their documents with the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) to contest for their present Parliamentary Seats as Independent Candidates, after having legitimately lost the 2024 Parliamentary Primaries in their respective constituencies, in the upcoming December 7, 2024 Parliament Elections (See \"It's Absurd to Seek Stay of Execution in a Case the Court Has Not Made Any Orders - Renowned Lawyer on Supreme Court Ruling\" Modernghana.com 10/19/24).Well, in the informed and carefully considered opinion of my old lawyer friend and high school mate, who also noted that quite a slew of changes has been made to the manner and the quality of legal and judicial practice or jurisprudence in the country, his former lawyer colleagues back home may be obviously and unarguably far more conversant or intimately familiar with the intricacies of standard legal practices that presently prevail in Ghana. He was, however, also quick to add that unlike hereabouts the United States of America, in Ghana, where the New Patriotic Party's Parliamentary Majority Leader had swiftly applied to the Apex Court for a peremptory Stay of Execution injunction to be promptly placed on or against Speaker Bagbin's unilateral declaration of the vacancy created by the decision of the afore-referenced four current Members of the august House, it is deemed to be procedurally standard fare for the Supreme Court to issued an order in a matter or a case that had yet to be either formally or officially presented by the plaintiff to the Court in the form of an advisory.My legal maven friend further noted that ordinarily, Mr. Alexander Afenyo-Markin's petition to the Apex Court would have first been lodged at or with a lower court, such as the Accra High Court, after whose inability to satisfactorily resolve matters for both or one of the parties, the petitioner or the respondent would then have had to appeal to the Supreme Court for final redress. Fortunately or unfortunately, in Ghana, as already adumbrated in the preceding, the Supreme Court can be perfectly legitimately appealed to for what my \"legal luminary\" friend, as one morbidly cynical and complacent reader of one of the most recent pieces of Yours Truly's columns gibed a couple of days ago, referred to as the \"Advisory Opinion\" of the highest and the most powerful court of the land.For the part of the present author, however, it well appears that Speaker Bagbin and the Mahama and the Johnson \"The Mosquito\" Asiedu-Nketia Posse among the vanguard ranks of the country's main opposition National Democratic Congress had apparently predetermined well in advance that the strategically delaying tactic that has infamously come to be widely known as \"ATUGU-TRICKS,\" obviously from \"Atuguba Tricks,\" would be willy-nilly deployed by a characteristically snail-gaited or slow-placed and an unhealthily lethargic traditional Ghanaian Judicial System and Establishment to tarry matters just strategically long enough to ensure the irreversibility or the irrevocability of the Bagbin Declaration, which had been deliberately and deviously orchestrated and aimed at effectively \"minoritizing\" and thoroughly sabotaging the otherwise progressive agenda of the lame-duck Akufo-Addo-led government of the New Patriotic Party, thereby scoring cheap political points in the runup to the landmark and the watershed \"Breaking-The-Eight\" December 7, 2024 General Election, in particular the December 7, 2024 Presidential Election, on behalf of the politically desperate and the megalomaniacal leadership of the National Democratic Congress, as many adult-Ghanaian citizens of age wistfully and scandalously witnessed in the Matter of the then Candidate Akufo-Addo-led 2012 Presidential-Election Petition, in which a passionately pro-National Democratic Congress partisan and President of the unspeakably amateurish Panel of Apex Court Adjudicators, to wit, Associate Justice William Atuguba, vehemently insisted that true and time-tested justice could only be unimpeachably delivered or secured in the polling booth and from the ballot box, and not from the Atuguba-presided panel of Apex Court Jurists.In the wake of the handing down of the decision in the Akufo-Addo-led 2012 Presidential-Election Petition, which was widely deemed to have been one of the worst examples of the administration of justice by the Supreme Court in postcolonial Ghana, a veritable travesty of justice, to be certain, Justice William Atuguba would be generously rewarded by a euphoric and a clearly undeservingly triumphant President John \"I Have No Classmates in Ghana\" Dramani Mahama by almost immediately naming one of Justice Atuguba's relatives to the propinquitously cushy boondoggle portfolio of Executive-Secretary to the newly judicially elected President Mahama.Today, that William Atuguba relative, Dr. Raymond Atuguba, a Harvard Graduate School of Law alumnus, is the Dean of the University of Ghana Law School and is almost certain to be named, once again, to another boondoggle executive portfolio, in the highly unlikely event of the twice-rejected, one-term former President Mahama being returned to Jubilee House, so that \"He can correct his past mistakes\" and spend the present making even more egregious mistakes and blunders to be corrected by his next immediate successor.

    "title": "Kamala's Cookie Crumbles As Trump Dominates In Pittsburgh Bakery Sales [WATCH]",
    "content": "In the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election, a Pittsburgh-area bakery, Oakmont Bakery, has become a unique battleground for political preferences, showcasing cookies featuring the faces of presidential candidates.The bakery has a tradition of creating election-themed cookies, and this year is no exception.According to Tony Serrao, the general manager of Oakmont Bakery, sales figures reveal that former President Donald Trump is currently leading the cookie sales with a staggering 21,000 cookies sold.FREE Trump Fighting For America Gold Coin - Fight Fight Fight!In comparison, Kamala Harris has only managed to sell 6,200 cookies, while a third option labeled the \"sweetest candidate\" -- a Pączki cookie for those who are not supporters of either candidate -- has sold about 9,800 units.Michael Sullivan, the retail manager at the bakery, explained that the introduction of the \"sweetest candidate\" cookie was a fun way to offer an alternative to voters dissatisfied with the main candidates. \"Just to sort of keep it fun and loose, we have a third-party (cookie) this year,\" Sullivan stated.The KDKA-TV news team visited the bakery and reported that they did not encounter any customers purchasing the Kamala Harris cookies during their time there.One customer, Barb Gerding, shared her excitement over the Trump cookies, stating, \"I had to get my mom one because she's 87 years old and she loves Trump.\"This sentiment reflects a broader trend among customers who seem eager to support their preferred candidates through these baked goods.While the cookie sales have become a lighthearted way for voters to express their preferences, it's worth noting that the cookie tally did not accurately predict the outcome of the election in 2020. Serrao acknowledged this, saying, \"The cookies can't predict the election.\"Nonetheless, the current sales figures may be an encouraging sign for Trump's campaign, as new polling from Rasmussen Reports shows him leading Harris by three points in Pennsylvania.The cookies at Oakmont Bakery have sparked conversations not only about the candidates but also about the state of the race itself. \"I think a lot of people are getting the candidate they are supporting,\" Sullivan remarked. \"But then there are some people that are just like, I'm going to get this candidate so I can chomp into them.\"As the election approaches, these cookies serve as a playful reminder of the contentious political climate and the passion voters have for their preferred candidates.With Trump and Harris both vying for votes in a key battleground state, the bakery's cookie sales could be seen as a reflection of the broader sentiment among Pennsylvania voters.As the campaign heats up, the unique approach of using cookies as a measure of political support will likely continue to draw attention, providing a fun and tasty way for locals to engage with the electoral process.The opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of Objectivist.

    "title": "Will lawmakers and congressional candidates commit to upholding the 2024 results? We asked",
    "content": "WASHINGTON ‒ With nearly half of the country's Republicans and a quarter of Democrats questioning whether next month's presidential election will be fair, USA TODAY wanted to know where members of the next Congress stand on the issue.So, we surveyed all 382 members of the House and 91 Senators who are either running for re-election or would still be in office in January, asking whether they would uphold the 2024 presidential election results, regardless of the winner. (The remaining lawmakers who were not surveyed either lost their primary races, are seeking a different office or are retiring from Congress.)We also polled 747 candidates running for the House and Senate whose names are on the ballot this year. USA TODAY couldn't find contact information for 23 additional candidates.Those who agreed without condition to support the results of the election, regardless of whether Republican Donald Trump or Democrat Kamala Harris is declared the winner include:Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.After the 2020 election, when then-President Donald Trump didn't want to accept that he had lost his bid for re-election against President Joe Biden, he tried to convince members of Congress to raise objections to the votes of several state's electors.More:We asked every lawmaker if they'd uphold the 2024 election results. Here's what was saidTypically, Congress simply witnesses the counting of the electors' votes. Under the Electoral Count Act of 1887, only a single member of the House and Senate was required to object to electors and state the reason for objection in writing.On Jan. 6, 2021, after rioters were cleared from the U.S. Capitol, 139 Republicans in the House and eight Republicans in the Senate objected to the electoral votes from Pennsylvania and Arizona, hoping to keep Trump in office.All Democrats in both congressional chambers accepted the 2020 election results. Numerous recounts, reviews and forensic audits have found the election outcome to be legitimate, and Trump himself has publicly acknowledged that he lost to Biden by a \"whisker.\"Since then, lawmakers passed the Electoral Count Reform Act ‒ a modernized version of the 1887 law ‒ so that objections must be signed by at least one-fifth of the members of the House and one-fifth of the Senators.The Congress elected this year, which will be sworn in on Jan. 3, 2025, will witness the counting of the electoral votes three days later. Whether they will accept the results and the winner is the question.Formality turned politicalOne example of how fraught this largely ceremonial practice has become: A Republican lawmaker who once eloquently defended the importance of Congress upholding the election results won't commit to doing so again.\"Congress cannot overrule millions of votes certified by those states. It's a threat to our federalist system and would play into the hands of those seeking to end the Electoral College,\" Congresswoman Victoria Spartz, of Indiana, said in 2021.But recently, Spartz, who held off eight Republican primary challengers, answered USA TODAY's query by saying: \"This question cannot be answered now, since we do not know what is going to happen in November and what the circumstances will be.\"Fairness is in the eye of the beholderA dozen sitting House members and four Senators said they would only certify the election results if they believed the results to be \"fair,\" which they defined in various ways.\"You got to stick to what the law says, what the Constitution says,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican of Missouri told USA TODAY.\"Look as long as everybody's following election law in the states, I have no problem,\" said Byron Donalds, a Republican Congressman whose district covers much of Southwest Florida, including Fort Myers and Naples. Donalds voted against certification in 2021.Notably, two Republican senators who upheld the 2020 election results also attached certain caveats to accepting this year's results.Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La. said he would want the process of appeals to be exhausted before he would accept any results.Susan Collins, R-Maine., said she would uphold the results as long as she believed \"the election was conducted in a fair way.\" Collins was one of the main instigators of the Electoral Count Reform Act, which she said would hopefully avoid \"another Jan. 6.\"Among Democrats, Rep. Frederica Wilson, of Florida, was one of seven sitting legislators who expressed concerns about election fairness.\"Under normal circumstances, I would fully accept and certify the election results without hesitation,\" she told USA TODAY.But she and other Democrats were upset about a recent move to hand-count ballots in Georgia, which she said could open the results up to abuse. A Georgia judge blocked the rule Tuesday after USA TODAY conducted the interviews, but Republicans are appealing the ruling.Still, she said, \"should any lawsuits arise, once the U.S. Justice Department has completed the legal process and (reviewed the) election process, I will accept and certify the election results, no matter the outcome.\"Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., said that \"any Republican effort to once again impose phony electors to rig the electoral college will be met with my full resistance when the U.S. House is required to certify the election.\"No answer and non-answersA total of thirty lawmakers and candidates responded but said they couldn't answer USA TODAY's question.\"How can I commit to anything with an election that hasn't taken place yet?\" said Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Republican of Colorado, adding she still has the same hesitations about the results that she did in 2020, when she declined to certify.Republican candidate Randall Arrington, who's running in Louisiana, said he couldn't commit one way or the other but would make a decision based on his \"rational assessment of the election process, and whether or not voter fraud has taken place.\"Other House and Senate lawmakers declined to respond at all, including 201 Republicans, 100 Democrats and two independents.One of those, Republican Sen. JD Vance, of Ohio, Trump's running mate, did not answer whether he would challenge this year's election results in the vice presidential debate earlier this month. However, at a campaign stop in Pennsylvania Thursday, Vance said that Trump did not lose in the 2020 election \"by the words I would use.\"House Speaker Mike Johnson did not reply to USA TODAY's request for comment, but said in a press conference last month that he would follow the Constitution if the election is free, fair and safe. Johnson shepherded an amicus brief in support of a Texas lawsuit aimed at overturning the 2020 election results in four swing states.Agreeing to certifyOnly one lawmaker who voted against certification in 2021 said he would uphold the results this time, regardless of the outcome. Rep. John Carter, R-Texas, told USA TODAY in an interview at the Capitol that \"if Congress does have to certify, I will certify.\"Among the candidates, some are making election integrity an issue in their campaign.About half of the Democrats and third-party candidates are running in deep red states against opponents who objected to the electoral results in 2021.\"I have a problem with any incumbent and any person who was there that voted to not certify the election results,\" said Rodney Govens, a Democrat running in Arkansas' first congressional district against Rep. Steve Womack, a Republican.Others are running in races where the incumbent could lose. Although it could enable election deniers to come into office, several candidates said they would uphold the 2024 election results ‒ including two Republicans running in toss-up seats in Pennsylvania and Colorado.Two lawmakers, Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., and Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., spearheaded a bipartisan unity agreement to acknowledge that the election winner is certified on Jan. 6, 2025, and serve as a voice for calm, hoping to avoid a repeat of the violence of Jan. 6, 2021.\"Peaceful transfer of power is a key part as core to our Constitution, our democracy and it's our responsibility to give the American people faith in our electoral process,\" Gottheimer told USA TODAY.Twenty-nine other Democrats and five other moderate Republicans up for re-election ‒ many of them running in tight races ‒ signed the pledge.Sen. Kevin Cramer, from North Dakota, didn't sign but was among 10 Republicans who told USA TODAY they would uphold the 2024 election results regardless of the results.\"Our role is not to determine whether to certify or not, but our role is to certify when the real certification happens at 50 states and some territories,\" Cramer said. \"That's the way I view it ... It's really the state's jobs to certify the electors, and then ours is to sort of validate that.\"",

    "title": "'I Would Rather Be Kamala Harris Than I Would Donald Trump'",
    "content": "When Joe Biden's top political aides started setting up his campaign early last year, Jim Messina was one of their first calls. Messina, who managed Barack Obama's re-election campaign, had plenty of thoughts on building a machine to get a second term for an unpopular president with a bad economy. For a while he sought to be helpful with occasional advice from the outside, including when he tried reminding Democrats of Biden's (narrow) possible paths to victory.But then those paths closed, Kamala Harris took over, and Democrats had a whole new race on their hands. Messina now leads Democracy Defenders, a super PAC that's backing the party's legal battles against Donald Trump and Republicans' challenges to voting rules and their rigged-election claims. He is also closely monitoring the campaign as one of the party's most wired-in operatives, who has worked closely with just about everyone atop Harris's team. I called him with about two weeks left until Election Day to talk about what he sees as her best shot at victory, Democrats' best ways to talk about abortion and January 6, and how nostalgia is buoying Trump over Harris when it comes to the economy.Play oracle for me for a second. How would you map out Kamala Harris's most likely path to 270 electoral votes?I've always said, all along, that the \"blue wall\" states are the path of least resistance for the Harris campaign. If she can win Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, plus the blue dot in Nebraska, then Harris will be our first woman president.But getting there is tough. When I ran President Obama's campaign, one of my jobs was to create as many pathways to 270 electoral votes as possible, and I think that's what they're doing -- they have backup states. Georgia is tied, and I was recently talking to the governor of North Carolina, who feels very good about what he's seeing. You combine Arizona and Nevada, you could lose one of the blue wall states. I think they have several pathways to get there.As I look at it -- and every night we run 66,000 simulations of the election and look very closely at it -- I would rather be Kamala Harris than I would Donald Trump for two reasons. One, I think she has room to grow. After three presidential campaigns, there isn't a voter who doesn't have an opinion of Trump. There are still people trying to figure out what she's about and what she can do to make their lives better. And the second thing is I think enthusiasm matters. The number that I looked at every day as a presidential campaign manager was enthusiasm. Why? Because really you want voters to do three things. Obviously you want them to vote for you, and then you want them to give you all their money. But almost as importantly, you want them to persuade their friends and family to vote. And in looking at enthusiasm, Harris has built a big enthusiasm lead over Trump. You see that in the rallies, you see his rallies not selling out. I'm not throwing a mean punch at him -- it's hard the third time, everyone's seen him in these states over and over and over.But look at her volunteer shifts. I did an event in the second district of Nebraska, and we thought there were going to be 25, 30 people there, and like 150 people showed up to knock on doors. Not even the organizers on the ground knew those people were coming. And then you look at the early vote stuff. It's too early to draw a whole lot of conclusions, but what seems to be true is that Democratic voters are more enthusiastic than Republicans. And in 2016 that was really the metric that said Trump was gonna win.The other thing I'm looking at, which I think is one of the underreported things about this election, is the gender divide. It's really been the story of every election since Dobbs. I remember sitting with Cecile Richards, the former head of Planned Parenthood, the day after Dobbs happened. She said, \"This ruling is going to age very poorly. This throws it to the states, and you're going to see all sorts of chaos. People, individually, will get very upset about this and take it out on elected officials.\" After 2022, I said to her, \"You were right.\" She goes, \"Oh, no no, Jim. I was right in those places, but the first time it's really on the ballot nationally is in the 2024 presidential election.\"I've spent some time this cycle in states where abortion is front-and-center thanks to referenda, like in Arizona and Nevada. You'll see where I'm going with this question in a second, but as I think about those states, I'm reminded of the focus in recent weeks on Harris's relatively weak numbers with Latino and Black men. I asked David Plouffe about this the other day, and he more or less made the point that even if she lags where previous Democratic candidates were with those voters, Harris would over-perform with other groups, including women of all kinds. And that's largely because of the abortion issue. Do you buy that? I know some abortion-rights activists and strategists have been warning Democrats that even though they've won consistently since Dobbs, they have to work to keep the focus on the issue and make sure people are paying as much attention as they were two years ago.The Republicans are out there saying that in smaller turnout elections, in referendums, in 2022, this issue played bigger but that in a general election it won't play as big. I don't think that's true, for one really big reason. Right now, women voters are going for Harris over Trump by 16 points, and this race really depends on how much Harris wins women by. Specifically, white women and working-class white women without a college degree could be the decisive voter group. White women make up about 36 percent of the overall electorate. Traditionally, Republicans win these voters -- these are the voters who broke Hillary Clinton's heart. Mitt Romney beat us with white women by 9 points, Trump won them by 6 points in 2016 and 7 points in 2020. Right now, it's deadlocked. That's just a massive swing. Harris is polling better with white women than any Democratic presidential candidate this century. So if she can keep white women close, that puts her in a very strong position.Does that mean you don't need to focus on African American men and Latino men and the bedrock of the Democratic Party, which is Black women? Of course it doesn't. You can walk and chew gum. You can do two things. There's this absolutely fucking stupid argument in my party that says you either turn your voters out or you persuade. The campaigns that win at the presidential level do both, and that is the campaign that Kamala Harris has built. She has the biggest field operation on the ground that we've ever seen to turn her vote out and to focus on some of the groups we've talked about: African Americans, Latinos, young people. And then she has a persuasion machine for these women. Now, these women are the same women who walked away from Hillary at the end after the Comey report, and she lost a very close election. So I agree that you can never stop talking about the abortion issue, and I think the Harris campaign knows this. It's now the single most important issue to women under 30, with 4 in 10 saying it's their top issue.Gretchen Whitmer is one of the best messengers we've ever seen on this. Think about how she talks about it: Abortion, IVF, and fertility treatments are pocketbook issues with women. And you can now see the Harris campaign talking about it in that way. There's this argument that, Well, in the end these women aren't abortion voters, they're economic voters and they're going to walk away from Harris in the end because of the economy. But Harris has made significant strides in eroding Trump's lead on this issue, and nearly two-thirds of women surveyed said inflation and the economy were an important issue as they decide their vote. Of these women, now 46 percent prefer Harris on the economy and 38 percent Trump. If she can keep it that close with these white-working class women and get them to vote like more educated women, she's going to win this election.You're talking about the movement we've seen on who voters trust more on the economy, specifically. One reason Harris has until recently struggled with this is clearly that she's part of an administration that many voters have problems with, especially when it comes to the economy. So when you study these latest positive shifts for her, do you interpret them as the product of Harris successfully differentiating herself from Joe Biden and his White House? Or is it just that people feel better about the economy now than they did a few weeks or months ago?I don't think any of those reasons are right. I think it's because she's become the change candidate. She's now the person that voters say is more like change, and it's not because she's distanced herself from Joe Biden. It's two reasons. Donald Trump's now running for the third time, and always makes it about himself every single day, so he is functioning as the incumbent in this race. And two, she embodies change in her story and her positions and who she is. With her positive campaign and laying out a clear agenda for where she wants to take this country, she's made it clear this is her campaign, not Joe Biden's, or Barack Obama's, or Bill Clinton's.When I look at the numbers on \"Who represents change in this election?\" questions and she leads, that is really important, because the overhanging thing for Democrats is 70-some percent of Americans think we're on the wrong track. Now, that's not a Joe Biden number. They blame both parties, they're unhappy with the partisanship, they're unhappy with a lot of things. But she is not bearing the brunt of a lot of that because she is viewed as the change candidate in this election.And yet, Trump is still at the absolute center of this race, for obvious reasons. What do you see him doing from a campaign perspective that concerns you now that we're two weeks out?Two things. It's incredibly cynical, but I think his team has done a great job hiding him. He's mostly stuck to his right-wing media bubble and voters are not seeing him as much. The problem for him is that the more people see him, the less they like him. He reminds them of the part of him they didn't like. And the second thing is that he still has a lead on the economy and that is a challenge. We need to blunt this weird nostalgia, voters thinking they were better off with him. This voter amnesia -- people forget we lived through the hell of his COVID policy, he was talking about injecting bleach, and the economy tanked!Sure, but isn't the evidence fairly clear at this point that voters aren't responding to messaging that says something like, \"Remember how bad COVID was? It was all Donald Trump's fault.\"What people are receptive to is the January 6 stuff. And he's playing right into that because he's talking about it over and over. If I was his campaign manager I'd be throwing my desk out of the office.Okay, so what's the best way you've seen for Harris to talk about this, or about Trump as a threat to democracy? Clearly Biden tried to center this issue for over a year when he was running, and it never stuck as the issue in the race.I really like this new thing where she reads his comments on January 6, and what he's said recently. In both the campaign and super PAC ads, they're now showing Trump talking about it. It really is a twofer issue for the Democrats. One, it really reminds the base how important this is, and two, we know swing voters just want all of this to go away. They've made their decision on January 6 -- they've made their decision on whether or not he lost -- and they just don't want to talk about it anymore. He reminds them. Her just going straight at it and saying, \"Let's just talk about what he said yesterday,\" I love that tactic.I want to talk about how you're preparing for legal war. Tell me what you'll be looking for when the polls close on November 5.One thing we know for sure is that if Trump loses he will try to steal this election. He and his allies are already laying the groundwork now. You've already seen over 100 lawsuits before the election, in all the battleground states and around the country, trying to change the rules. In Georgia, they tried to change the rules a month before the election and the court stopped them. They tried to disenfranchise 225,000 people in North Carolina, and they're trying to change who can vote and when they should vote in Arizona. This stuff is all happening and it's going to get worse after Election Day. It's not just me saying this: Every day Trump is lying about millions of people voting illegally and about illegal immigrants voting.I'm curious: How do you respond to the fairly common argument from some Democrats that all this is clearly true, but that there's a massive difference between now and 2020 because Trump was president then, and it's something entirely different trying to seize power versus trying to keep it?Some of this is damage on the front end. We know what their goal is: to create chaos and confusion and weaken the trust in the electoral system. We know that some of these lawsuits pre- and post-election are meant to scare voters and make it seem like it's going to be really hard. He's already saying he's going to send supporters to \"watch the polls,\" which means voter intimidation. And when people see those stories they start to get worried and they say, \"Jesus, is it even worth going to vote?\"I also think we shouldn't assume that the Supreme Court is going to be a rational actor on some of this stuff. Let's not assume that it means much that we are in government now. We need to have a long memory from the 2000 election and understand that things can happen. I'm just not as confident as people who think that. It's more serious than some well-meaning Democrats think it is.",

    "title": "'Walking on a tightrope': Divided city in Michigan braced for US election unrest",
    "content": "The swing state of Michigan is on a knife-edge, with polling putting Kamala Harris just 0.6 percentage points aheadIN LANSING, USA - It is less than four years since tanks rolled into Michigan's capital city of Lansing.Days after thousands of rioters stormed the Capitol in Washington, DC demanding the 2020 election result be overturned - spurred on by Donald Trump who claimed the vote had been rigged - authorities in Lansing received intelligence that their state house had been identified as a target for further unrest.\"We had to have the National Guard called out. I had tanks and troop carriers on the streets of my city, which I had never seen before,\" Andy Schor, Lansing's Democratic Mayor, told .\"It was awful to see that our political system had gotten to that point where people could not fathom a peaceful transition of power.\"The violence Lansing had braced for in 2021 never materialised. Mayor Schor believes rioters were deterred by the scale of the security. But as the next presidential election looms, the swing state city is once again preparing for the possibility of unrest.Michigan is one of a handful of key \"purple\" states set to define the 2024 presidential election, and residents say it feels more politically divided than ever.Polling shows that Michigan's race is on a knife-edge; FiveThirtyEight's most recent poll put Trump at 47 per cent and Vice-President Kamala Harris at 47.6.\"It's going to be close regardless. So if  loses by 100,000 votes, there are going to be claims of electoral fraud,\" says Mayor Schor.\"We know that the systems work. We have Republicans and Democrats saying the systems work, but he just can't believe it if he loses. If he loses, and it's close, then I'm extremely concerned that they'll try and intimidate electors.\"The mayor declines to share details, but says Lansing has \"contingency plans\" in case of political violence and local officers on standby working with state police.\"I think this election is one of the most important in our lifetimes,\" he says. \"It's very divided. People are very aggressive. If they love Trump, they love him, and if they hate him, they hate him. The Democrats, they hate Trump. When we say democracy is at stake, we believe it. It's almost like a heat right now. It's very aggressive and hot, and people are ready for this election to be over.\"At Lansing's elections office, groups of election workers are undergoing final training sessions before polling day.In a double-locked room, the mail-in ballots already returned are being stored. In another, Dominion voting systems are prepared for counting, a year after Dominion settled a $787.5m (£635m) lawsuit with Fox News over false claims that its voting technology was compromised in the 2020 election.At the entrance to the elections office, voters are greeted with a life-size cardboard cutout of Lansing's beaming county clerk, Chris Swope.Mr Swope's job is politically neutral: to oversee elections, manage election staff and issue ballots. But in the last presidential election, workers like Mr Swope found themselves at the centre of Trump's firestorm.\"A good friend of mine who was a clerk got a threat and she left the profession. It's sad that people think... someone must have cheated if it didn't go the way I wanted,\" says Mr Swope, who has been in the post for 19 years.\"It does feel calmer . But it feels like there's the potential that it could rapidly change.\"This election year, Lansing has seen greater engagement than in any other vote Mr Swope can recall.His office has issued more absentee ballots than ever before, including to Lansing natives now living overseas, and 40 per cent have already been returned three weeks before the election - an unusually swift turnaround. Election officials are getting more queries than usual from people \"very nervous\" to check they've filled in their ballots correctly.\"I can remember past elections where voters would say, 'I'm not voting, there's not a dime a difference between the two'. I have not heard anyone say anything close to that at this time,\" he says.\"There's that heightened awareness and excitement, but that's what kind of makes me a little bit nervous, that it could take an ugly turn. When people are so excited, something not going their way could cause someone to react in a negative way.\"Lansing's election staff are in regular contact with their police department to ensure smooth communication in case of violence, and have been through several training sessions on how to respond.\"It just feels like walking on a tightrope a little bit,\" Mr Swope says.Though arguably more heated this year, Michigan's political divisions are not new.Since 1992, the state has voted almost exclusively Democrat in the presidential election, but bar Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, no candidate has won by more than 52 per cent of the vote.In 2020, the state was won by Joe Biden with a narrow margin of 2.8 percentage points, and in 2016, Trump beat Hillary Clinton by just 0.3 percentage points.\"A lot of it has to do with the fact that we're a very diverse state,\" says Mr Swope, regarding the history of swinging between candidates.\"We have the city of Detroit, which has hundreds of thousands of people in a single city, all the way to townships that are seven miles by seven miles and have 25 people living in them, and everything in between. We're also very diverse in jobs: we have agriculture to manufacturing to the auto industry. Michigan puts the world on wheels. With that kind of diversity, you're bound to have a lot of differences.\"Lansing city council member Brian Jackson believes the divide deepened in 2008.\"It's been polarised, honestly, ever since Obama was elected,\" he says. \"I think things started getting more hyper-partisan then, and that was really in reaction to Obama being the first black president and the fear that comes with that for some people.\"Since then, it's been so hyper-polarised and partisan. There might be swing people, but it's mostly about turnout. Swing voters exist, it just doesn't seem like at this point, there's a lot of them.\"Mayor Schor says that Michigan's voters tend to vote for candidates rather than party allegiance. This year, he believes that the candidates' approach to the economy will play the biggest role in how they vote.\"People will think about the prices going up. When they went to the restaurant it was $20, now it's $30. When they buy their jug of milk, it was $4 now it's $6,\" he says.\"I think people are always thinking about their pocketbook issues. But at the same time it's our job to remind people that things are more expensive, but they're also making more money. Unemployment is way down. Salaries are going up because businesses have to pay more in order to get talent.\"Trump's outspoken character is both a draw and a repellant for Michigan voters. While some value his directness, other traditional Republicans or swing voters struggle to stomach his more outlandish claims and apparent disregard for democratic norms.One of those is 74-year-old swing voter John Houston, a mortician-turned-taxi driver in Lansing.Mr Houston says he couldn't vote for Trump - but if Nikki Haley, who dropped out of the race to be Republican candidate in March, was the candidate, he may well be voting for her.\"He couldn't tell the truth if he wanted to,\" says Mr Houston. \"He's a convicted felon. He wants pardons for people who participated in the insurrection. I'm not going to vote Republican this election. I think it's time for a female president. Trump is going to be 81 if he takes office again. If he can't complete his term, it'll fall to JD Vance, who only has two years of political experience.\"Reproductive rights are important to Mr Houston, and many other voters speaks to in Lansing. \"I think government shouldn't be telling a woman what to do with her body. Anybody who thinks that, I can't support.\"Andrew, a 25-year-old government worker, says he is still undecided but is likely to vote for Trump.\"I don't like his rhetoric. I think a lot of people agree with me on that. It's more policy-wise; immigration policy, economic policy,\" he says. \"That's not to say social issues aren't also important, but the cost of living has gone up and that's because of the policies of the current administration. A lot of people are feeling the hurt from it. I don't get paid a lot, and I'm feeling the prices at the grocery store, and gas prices.\"Devon Ducharme, a 31-year-old web developer in Lansing, says he was voting for Harris reluctantly, saying the Democrats had been \"awful\" on Gaza and \"sound like the Republicans on immigration\", but said that the Republican Party was \"more insane\".\"Neither choice is all that great, but one is clearly more awful than the other.\"Mr Ducharme says he expecting riots if Trump loses, but adds: \"Even if they storm the capitol again, are 300 million people going to forget the result of an election they just saw? They can smash windows all they want to. I don't think anything changes.\"",

    "title": "Judges punishing  Jan. 6 rioters say they fear more political violence  as Election Day nears |    Jefferson City News-Tribune",
    "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- During the past four years, judges at Washington's federal courthouse have punished hundreds of rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol in an unprecedented assault on the nation's democracy. On the cusp of the next presidential election, some of those judges fear another burst of political violence could be coming.Before recently sentencing a rioter to prison, U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton said he prays Americans accept the outcome of next month's election. But the veteran judge expressed concern that Donald Trump and his allies are spreading the same sort of conspiracy theories that fueled the mob's Jan. 6, 2021, riot.\"That sore loser is saying the same things he said before,\" Walton said earlier this month without mentioning the Republican presidential nominee by name. \"He's riling up the troops again, so if he doesn't get what he wants, it's not inconceivable that we will experience that same situation again. And who knows? It could be worse.\"Walton, a nominee of President George W. Bush, is not alone. Other judges have said the political climate is ripe for another attack like the one injured more than 100 police officers at the Capitol. As Election Day nears, judges are frequently stressing the need to send a message beyond their courtrooms that political violence can't be tolerated.\"It scares me to think about what will happen if anyone on either side is not happy with the results of the election,\" Judge Jia Cobb, a nominee of President Joe Biden, said during a sentencing hearing last month for four Capitol rioters.Judge Rudolph Contreras lamented the potential for more politically motivated violence as he sentenced a Colorado man, Jeffrey Sabol, who helped other rioters drag a police officer into the mob. Sabol later told FBI agents that a \"call to battle was announced\" and that he had \"answered the call because he was a patriot warrior.\"\"It doesn't take much imagination to imagine a similar call coming out in the coming months, and the court would be concerned that Mr. Sabol would answer that call in the same way,\" Contreras, a President Barack Obama nominee, said in March before sentencing Sabol to more than five years in prison.Trump's distortion of the Jan. 6 attack has been a cornerstone of his bid to reclaim the White House. The former president has denied any responsibility for the crimes of supporters who smashed windows, assaulted police officers and sent lawmakers running into hiding as they met to certify President Joe Biden's 2020 victory.Trump has vowed to pardon rioters, whom he calls \"patriots\" and \"hostages,\" if he wins in November. And he said he would accept the results of the upcoming election only if it's \"free and fair,\" casting doubts reminiscent of his baseless claims in 2020.Judges have repeatedly used their platform on the bench to denounce those efforts to downplay the violence on Jan. 6 and cast the rioters as political prisoners. And some have raised concerns about what such rhetoric means for the future of the country and its democracy.\"We're in a real difficult time in our country, and I hope we can survive it,\" Walton said this month while sentencing a Tennessee nurse who used a pair of medical scissors to smash a glass door at the Capitol.\"I've got a young daughter, I've got a young grandson, and I would like for America to be available to them and be as good to them as it has been to me,\" he added. \"But I don't know if we survive with the mentality that took place that day.\"More than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes related to Jan. 6 siege, which disrupted the peaceful transfer of presidential power for the first time in the nation's history. More than 1,000 rioters have been convicted and sentenced. Roughly 650 of them received prison time ranging from a few days to 22 years.Justice Department prosecutors have argued in many cases that a prison sentence is necessary to deter convicted Capitol rioters from engaging in more politically motivated violence.\"With the 2024 presidential election approaching and many loud voices in the media and online continuing to sow discord and distrust, the potential for a repeat of January 6 looms ominously,\" prosecutors have repeatedly warned in court filings.Prosecutors argue that defendants who have shown little or no remorse for their actions on Jan. 6 could break the law again. Some rioters even seem to be proud of their crimes.The first rioter to enter the Capitol texted his mother, \"I'll go again given the opportunity.\" A man from Washington state who stormed the Capitol with fellow Proud Boys extremist group members told a judge, \"You can give me 100 years and I'd do it all over again.\" A Kentucky nurse who joined the riot told a television interviewer that she would \"do it again tomorrow.\"A Colorado woman known to her social media followers as the \"J6 praying grandma\" avoided a prison sentence in August when a magistrate judge sentenced her for disorderly conduct and trespassing on Capitol grounds. Rebecca Lavrenz told the judge that God, not Trump, led her to Washington on Jan. 6.\"And she has all but promised to do it all over again,\" said prosecutor Terence Parker.Prosecutors had sought 10 months behind bars. After her April trial conviction, Lavrenz went on a \"media blitz\" to defend the mob, spread misinformation, undermine confidence in the courts and boost her celebrity in a community that believes Jan. 6 \"was a good day for this country,\" Parker said.Magistrate Zia Faruqui sentenced Lavrenz to six months of home confinement and fined her $103,000, stressing the need to \"lower the volume\" before the next election.\"These outside influences, the people that are tearing our country apart, they're not going to help you,\" Faruqui told her.Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump gestures at a campaign event, Friday, Oct. 18, 2024, in Detroit.

    "title": "Two Texas cities represent divide between those who vote and those who can, but often don't |    Jefferson City News-Tribune",
    "content": "LEWISVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Deep in the heart of Texas' sprawl, the city of Lewisville embodies the Lone Star State.Bisected by Interstate 35 and ribboned with six- and eight-lane thoroughfares lined with chain stores, Mexican restaurants and pawn shops, Lewisville, 23 miles north of Dallas, is the prototypical slice of the nation's second most populous state. Its typical resident is about 36 years old, the same as in Texas. Similar to statewide, 6 out of 10 residents are not white, and about two-thirds of its voters cast ballots in the 2020 presidential election.Next door is the city of Flower Mound, a swath of swanky subdivisions with names such as Teal Wood Oaks and Chaucer Estates. Flower Mound looks more like the electorate that has kept Texas dominated by Republicans for decades. It is wealthier than Lewisville, more than two-thirds of its residents are white, and 78 percent of them voted in 2020.That discrepancy, between the diverse, potential electorate of Lewisville and the actual, heavily white electorate of Flower Mound, has been the subtext for the past two decades of U.S. politics.For a long time, the presumption has been that closing that gap between Lewisville and Flower Mound -- getting more people to vote and having the electorate better represent the country's actual population -- would help Democrats and hurt Republicans. That's because a larger electorate would mean more minorities voting, and those groups historically lean Democratic.That presumption helped spark the Great Replacement conspiracy theory among some conservatives, imagining a plot to import immigrants to substitute for more conservative white voters. It's been part of the fuel behind Republican-led efforts to make it tougher to vote, especially in Texas, which has some of the strictest election laws in the country. But this presidential election has flipped the script.Republicans have built their field campaign for Donald Trump around reaching what they believe is a vast population of infrequent, conservative-leaning voters. His campaign is counting on support from younger, Latino and African American voters who are less likely to go to the polls.Democrat Kamala Harris is relying on Black and Latino voters, but also on increasing her support among college-educated voters, a growing group that's both highly likely to vote and helped put Democrat Joe Biden in the White House in 2020.Middle class \"ends up running everything\"The contrast is clear in the neighboring cities in north Texas.In Flower Mound, Republicans who used to dominate voting in the suburb fear it's trending Democratic. In more diverse Lewisville, those who rarely vote or cannot are warming to Trump.\"I think Trump would make a difference,\" said Brandon Taylor, 35, who cannot vote because of criminal convictions but is trying to persuade his girlfriend, Whitney Black, to cast a ballot for the former president. \"We need that extra vote,\" he told Black as the two, now homeless, sat on a bench outside Lewisville's public library.Meanwhile, Martha Mackenzie, a retired Naval officer in Flower Mound, is a former Republican who left the party over Trump.\"I just can't get behind a lot of the BS behind Trump,\" McKenzie said, scoffing particularly at Trump's insistence that the 2020 election he lost to Biden was stolen from him.There are, of course, plenty of Harris supporters in Lewisville and numerous Trump voters in Flower Mound. The contrast between the towns goes beyond partisan politics and more to an age-old adage voiced by Sally Ortega Putney on a recent night in a Flower Mound office park.Putney, 59, and a handful of other volunteers were calling voters on behalf of the Democratic Party. She recalled spending hours outside Lewisville Latino markets trying, unsuccessfully, to find new voters.\"We got our hearts broken trying all sorts of different outreach. The lower class, they don't have the time, they're too busy trying to feed their kids,\" Putney said between calls that she and two other volunteers were making to voters.She gestured around the room: \"It's the middle class that ends up running everything, because we have the time to do it.\"Republicans use their power to maintain controlFor decades in Texas, Republicans have run things. The party has controlled the Legislature for more than 20 years and won every statewide race since 1994. As Texas has steadily grown more diverse, Republican margins have narrowed, but the GOP has taken steps to protect its hold on power.Texas Republicans have drawn some of the most notorious gerrymanders in the country, reshuffling the lines of state legislative and congressional districts to protect GOP politicians and push the Democratic voters who could oust them into a few oddly shaped districts. That ensures Democrats remain the minority in the Legislature.The Legislature in 2021 tightened election laws in response to Trump's false fraud claims. Lawmakers banned election offices from holding 24-hour voting after that had become popular in a major Democratic-leaning county and they prohibited anyone from sending mail ballot applications to eligible voters.Since then Texas Republicans have continued to push back against a perceived menace of improper additional voters.Attorney General Ken Paxton sued two of the state's largest and most Democratic-leaning counties to stop their voter registration drives, and his office raided the homes of leaders of Latino civil rights groups in what it said was an investigation of possible election fraud.\"There's no question that the design of a lot of Texas' election laws, both old and new, is rooted in the idea of demographic change and that new voters won't support the people in power,\" said Michael Li, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice in New York, who grew up in Dallas and still watches the state carefully.GOP is more than \"a bunch of rich white people\"Texas has had recent experience with a surge of new voters, and it didn't turn out as badly for Republicans as the party feared.In 2018, Democrat Beto O'Rourke challenged Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. The little-known congressman became a national phenomenon for his populist message and get-out-the-vote pushes. He lost 51 percent to 48 percent.Jim Henson, a political scientist at the University of Texas, said the new voters who turned out in 2018 were evenly split between Republicans and Democrats -- only slightly more Democratic than the normally conservative-leaning Texas electorate.\"There are untapped voters for both parties,\" he said.Lacey Riley is one Republican who thinks Texas' voting laws are just \"safeguarding the election,\" not making it tougher for new voters.\"I think everyone should vote,\" said Riley, chair of the Denton County Republican Party.A Flower Mound resident, Riley said she's excited to see the GOP reaching new voters, including ones in Lewisville.\"The Republican Party has changed,\" she said. \"It's not a bunch of rich white people.\"Riley acknowledges that Flower Mound, which has a population of 80,000, is changing. She was stunned to watch a friend running for local school board get heckled in public for being conservative -- something unthinkable in times past.The city was founded in 1961 to prevent its patch of prairie from being swallowed by other fast-growing suburbs. For decades, it has prized slow growth and single-family housing, which has led to intense political fights over development.A city with a history of low political engagementIn contrast, Lewisville dates to the 19th century and has a small downtown with a few historic buildings.When the area began to grow, the city let various property owners do what they wanted with their land, leading to its hodge-podge of different types of development. While the city of 135,000 contains subdivisions that wouldn't look out of place in Flower Mound, about half its residential properties are apartment buildings that attract a younger, less wealthy and more diverse population.Delia Parker Mims, the Denton County Democratic Party chair, lives in Lewisville. The level of political engagement is just lower in the town than in Flower Mound -- so low that Mims failed to find enough people to form a local Democratic club and had to create a Lewisville-Flower Mound one to assemble a critical mass of members.Mims. however, blames local Republicans who run the county for keeping turnout in Lewisville down by forcing voters to go to the polls at assigned precincts that often change location from election to election, rather than at central vote centers where anyone can vote.Lewisville's comparative marginalization does not only come from its eligible voters not voting, though. One-fifth of its residents are foreign-born, and many are not citizens. That means they are shut out of the political process.That is unnerving for some like Jose Colmenares, 56, a former Venezuelan university administrator who fled to Texas last year. He notes that one of the candidates in the presidential race, Harris, seems friendlier to migrants than Trump, who complains of an \"invasion\" of people from South America and promises mass deportations.\"All of us would support this candidate if we could,\" Colmenares said of Harris as he stood outside one of the city's Latino markets.Same body shop, different views on presidential raceAlex Salguero came to Lewisville from Guatemala in 1994 and started working as a mechanic. He eventually opened his own body shop in a custom-built building on a downtown corner. He is aghast at the way Trump talks about immigrants -- \"it hurts our heart\" -- and said many Latinos in town feel that way, but were dispirited by the complexities of the U.S. election system.He cited 2016, when Democrat Hillary Clinton won 3 million more votes than Trump nationally but lost because Trump beat her in the Electoral College.\"That's when you go back and say, 'Why did I vote?'\" said Salguero, who remains a regular Democratic voter.Ivan Barrera, 32, works in Salguero's shop and shares his boss' concern about the former president's rhetoric on immigration. Still, he is leaning toward Trump because Barrera normally votes Republican.\"I don't want nothing given to me,\" Barrera said, \"because I know nothing was given to my parents growing up.\"Barrera's trying to persuade his parents, Mexican immigrants who live outside Lewisville, to support Trump.There's a catch. His parents have been citizens for decades, but they still are not registered to vote.A water tower sits near businesses in Lewisville, Texas, Wednesday, Oct. 2, 2024.

    "title": "Will lawmakers and congressional candidates commit to upholding the 2024 results? We asked",
    "content": "WASHINGTON ‒ With nearly half of the country's Republicans and a quarter of Democrats questioning whether next month's presidential election will be fair, USA TODAY wanted to know where members of the next Congress stand on the issue.So, we surveyed all 382 members of the House and 91 Senators who are either running for re-election or would still be in office in January, asking whether they would uphold the 2024 presidential election results, regardless of the winner. (The remaining lawmakers who were not surveyed either lost their primary races, are seeking a different office or are retiring from Congress.)We also polled 747 candidates running for the House and Senate whose names are on the ballot this year. USA TODAY couldn't find contact information for 23 additional candidates.Those who agreed without condition to support the results of the election, regardless of whether Republican Donald Trump or Democrat Kamala Harris is declared the winner include:After the 2020 election, when then-President Donald Trump didn't want to accept that he had lost his bid for re-election against President Joe Biden, he tried to convince members of Congress to raise objections to the votes of several state's electors.Typically, Congress simply witnesses the counting of the electors' votes. Under the Electoral Count Act of 1887, only a single member of the House and Senate was required to object to electors and state the reason for objection in writing.On Jan. 6, 2021, after rioters were cleared from the U.S. Capitol, 139 Republicans in the House and eight Republicans in the Senate objected to the electoral votes from Pennsylvania and Arizona, hoping to keep Trump in office.All Democrats in both congressional chambers accepted the 2020 election results. Numerous recounts, reviews and forensic audits have found the election outcome to be legitimate, and Trump himself has publicly acknowledged that he lost to Biden by a \"whisker.\"Since then, lawmakers passed the Electoral Count Reform Act ‒ a modernized version of the 1887 law ‒ so that objections must be signed by at least one-fifth of the members of the House and one-fifth of the Senators.The Congress elected this year, which will be sworn in on Jan. 3, 2025, will witness the counting of the electoral votes three days later. Whether they will accept the results and the winner is the question.One example of how fraught this largely ceremonial practice has become: A Republican lawmaker who once eloquently defended the importance of Congress upholding the election results won't commit to doing so again.\"Congress cannot overrule millions of votes certified by those states. It's a threat to our federalist system and would play into the hands of those seeking to end the Electoral College,\" Congresswoman Victoria Spartz, of Indiana, said in 2021.But recently, Spartz, who held off eight Republican primary challengers, answered USA TODAY's query by saying: \"This question cannot be answered now, since we do not know what is going to happen in November and what the circumstances will be.\"A dozen sitting House members and four Senators said they would only certify the election results if they believed the results to be \"fair,\" which they defined in various ways.\"You got to stick to what the law says, what the Constitution says,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican of Missouri told USA TODAY.\"Look as long as everybody's following election law in the states, I have no problem,\" said Byron Donalds, a Republican Congressman whose district covers much of Southwest Florida, including Fort Myers and Naples. Donalds voted against certification in 2021.Notably, two Republican senators who upheld the 2020 election results also attached certain caveats to accepting this year's results.Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La. said he would want the process of appeals to be exhausted before he would accept any results.Susan Collins, R-Maine., said she would uphold the results as long as she believed \"the election was conducted in a fair way.\" Collins was one of the main instigators of the Electoral Count Reform Act, which she said would hopefully avoid \"another Jan. 6.\"Among Democrats, Rep. Frederica Wilson, of Florida, was one of seven sitting legislators who expressed concerns about election fairness.\"Under normal circumstances, I would fully accept and certify the election results without hesitation,\" she told USA TODAY.But she and other Democrats were upset about a recent move to hand-count ballots in Georgia, which she said could open the results up to abuse. A Georgia judge blocked the rule Tuesday after USA TODAY conducted the interviews, but Republicans are appealing the ruling.Still, she said, \"should any lawsuits arise, once the U.S. Justice Department has completed the legal process and (reviewed the) election process, I will accept and certify the election results, no matter the outcome.\"Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., said that \"any Republican effort to once again impose phony electors to rig the electoral college will be met with my full resistance when the U.S. House is required to certify the election.\"A total of thirty lawmakers and candidates responded but said they couldn't answer USA TODAY's question.\"How can I commit to anything with an election that hasn't taken place yet?\" said Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Republican of Colorado, adding she still has the same hesitations about the results that she did in 2020, when she declined to certify.Republican candidate Randall Arrington, who's running in Louisiana, said he couldn't commit one way or the other but would make a decision based on his \"rational assessment of the election process, and whether or not voter fraud has taken place.\"Other House and Senate lawmakers declined to respond at all, including 201 Republicans, 100 Democrats and two independents.One of those, Republican Sen. JD Vance, of Ohio, Trump's running mate, did not answer whether he would challenge this year's election results in the vice presidential debate earlier this month. However, at a campaign stop in Pennsylvania Thursday, Vance said that Trump did not lose in the 2020 election \"by the words I would use.\"House Speaker Mike Johnson did not reply to USA TODAY's request for comment, but said in a press conference last month that he would follow the Constitution if the election is free, fair and safe. Johnson shepherded an amicus brief in support of a Texas lawsuit aimed at overturning the 2020 election results in four swing states.Only one lawmaker who voted against certification in 2021 said he would uphold the results this time, regardless of the outcome. Rep. John Carter, R-Texas, told USA TODAY in an interview at the Capitol that \"if Congress does have to certify, I will certify.\"Among the candidates, some are making election integrity an issue in their campaign.About half of the Democrats and third-party candidates are running in deep red states against opponents who objected to the electoral results in 2021.\"I have a problem with any incumbent and any person who was there that voted to not certify the election results,\" said Rodney Govens, a Democrat running in Arkansas' first congressional district against Rep. Steve Womack, a Republican.Others are running in races where the incumbent could lose. Although it could enable election deniers to come into office, several candidates said they would uphold the 2024 election results ‒ including two Republicans running in toss-up seats in Pennsylvania and Colorado.Two lawmakers, Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., and Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., spearheaded a bipartisan unity agreement to acknowledge that the election winner is certified on Jan. 6, 2025, and serve as a voice for calm, hoping to avoid a repeat of the violence of Jan. 6, 2021.\"Peaceful transfer of power is a key part as core to our Constitution, our democracy and it's our responsibility to give the American people faith in our electoral process,\" Gottheimer told USA TODAY.Twenty-nine other Democrats and five other moderate Republicans up for re-election ‒ many of them running in tight races ‒ signed the pledge.Sen. Kevin Cramer, from North Dakota, didn't sign but was among 10 Republicans who told USA TODAY they would uphold the 2024 election results regardless of the results.\"Our role is not to determine whether to certify or not, but our role is to certify when the real certification happens at 50 states and some territories,\" Cramer said. \"That's the way I view it ... It's really the state's jobs to certify the electors, and then ours is to sort of validate that.\"",

    "title": "Opinion: Best outcome for Republican Party is to lose 2024 election, return to its roots",
    "content": "The Republican Party stands at a critical juncture in its history, and the best path forward is a temporary setback in the 2024 presidential election. A loss by Donald Trump to Kamala Harris would provide the impetus needed for the GOP to return to its core principles and broaden its appeal.Fiscal responsibility and deficit reductionThe Republican Party has long championed fiscal conservatism, but this commitment has wavered in recent years. Donald Trump's policies, particularly the 2017 tax cuts and increased spending, contributed significantly to the record rise in the budget deficit.A return to Ronald Reagan's approach of balancing tax cuts with spending reductions is crucial. The party should recommit to responsible budgeting and deficit reduction to ensure long-term economic stability.Immigration reform and economic growthLegal immigration can be a powerful tool for economic expansion and provide a critical labor supply for small businesses and the construction trades. Reagan recognized this, supporting the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which provided a path to legal status for millions of undocumented immigrants. He understood that immigrant labor could help address workforce shortages and fuel economic growth. The GOP should embrace this perspective, advocating for streamlined legal immigration processes to expand the labor pool and reduce inflationary pressures on wages and make housing more affordable.Sensible abortion policyThe party's hardline stance on abortion has alienated many moderate voters. A more nuanced approach, allowing exceptions for rape, incest, and to save the mother's life, would align better with public opinion. Additionally, clearly defining emergency contraceptives legal under federal law would demonstrate a commitment to personal freedom and medical autonomy. This middle ground could help the party appeal to a broader range of voters while still respecting the deeply held beliefs of its base.Balanced approach to gun rightsWhile staunchly defending Second Amendment rights, Reagan also recognized the need for some firearm regulations. He supported the Brady Bill, which mandated federal background checks on firearm purchasers. The GOP should consider a similar balanced approach, potentially supporting assault weapon bans while vigorously protecting the right to bear arms for self-defense and sporting purposes. This nuanced stance could appeal to both gun rights advocates and those concerned about gun violence.Moving beyond divisive rhetoricDonald Trump's approach to politics, characterized by inflammatory rhetoric and fear-mongering, has limited the party's ability to expand its base beyond white male voters. This strategy may energize a portion of the electorate but alienates many others, including women, minorities, and younger voters. By rejecting these tactics and embracing a more inclusive message, the Republican Party can broaden its appeal and build a diverse coalition capable of long-term electoral success.In conclusion, a temporary setback in 2024 could provide the Republican Party with an opportunity for introspection and renewal. By returning to its roots of fiscal responsibility, embracing sensible immigration reform, adopting a more moderate stance on social issues, and rejecting divisive rhetoric, the GOP can position itself for future success. This approach would honor the legacy of leaders like Ronald Reagan while adapting to the realities of 21st century America, ensuring the party's relevance and competitiveness in the years to come.",

    "content": "Early voting for the Nov. 5, 2024, presidential election runs from Oct. 18-29 in Louisiana. (Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana set a new record for the first day of early voting, slightly exceeding its total from four years ago when officials had to take measures for the coronavirus pandemic.A total of 176,882 voters cast ballots Friday for the Nov. 5 election, according to the Louisiana Secretary of State's office. That's 1.3% more when compared with 174,533 votes submitted on day one of early voting in the 2020 election.This year's early voting period in Louisiana ends Oct. 29, with polls open 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily except for Sundays.Early voting has been available in Louisiana since 2008. Turnout by party has historically leaned heavily in favor of Democrats, who have accounted for roughly half or more of the state's early voters in each of the past four presidential elections.However, Republicans held a slight edge on day one of early voting this year. They totaled 75,455 votes to 74,311 for Democrats. \"Other\" voters accounted for 27,166 votes.Another early trend: Far more women voted early than men in Louisiana, with 102,178 showing up on day one. That was 31% more than their male counterparts.Black early voter turnout in Louisiana was down on day one from four years ago. They cast one-fourth of all ballots Friday compared with nearly one-third in 2020. Over the entire early period in 2020, Black voters made up nearly 30% of all voters.The high mark over an entire early voting period in Louisiana was set four years ago with 986,428 for the presidential race between Joe Biden and Donald Trump.Louisiana governor's elections have drawn far fewer people during the early voting period when compared to presidential election years. Just less than 369,000 showed up for the October 2023 primary that Jeff Landry won outright.In the much closer 2019 governor's election, more than 503,000 voters participated in the runoff between John Bel Edwards and Eddie Rispone, up from approximately 386,000 in the primary.Louisiana Illuminator is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

    "content": "Ohio politics reporter Haley BeMiller explains three different ways that you can cast a vote in the upcoming November election.Early voting for the 2024 presidential election has already begun. If you were not one of the early birds, I ask that you spend time studying the qualities and platform of both candidates and hopefully make a decision based on what is best for all residents of the United States - not just those of one party or the other for your personal preferences.In Ohio, we have a hotly-contested senatorial race and Issue 1 that need serious investigation. But whatever you do, just vote. One vote can and has made a difference. If you believe in a Supreme Being, you might spend some time in prayer and then vote.I had a doctor's appointment in Columbus early Wednesday morning. I couldn't believe the change in colors of leaves in the past seven days. The landscape just gets more beautiful with each passing day.Speaking of landscape - were you able to see the Northern Lights last week with the naked eye? Such brilliants shades of purple, green and blue. Many folks shared their pictures on social media and more were shared by various broadcasts on television. Mother Nature at her finest.Mother Nature taking toll through Helene and MiltonAnd while we in the northern states are enjoying colorful leaves and cosmic sights, there are thousands in the south who have devastatingly lost everything - either from Hurricane Helene or Milton or both. I have friends in Bradenton, Florida, that ended up with three feet of sand throughout their home once the water left. I can't fathom shoveling sand out through a window or door in order to accurately assess total damages.Other friends have had flood waters around them but not in their house. It will take months to clean up and repair what is repairable. Having to start over again will not be an easy task, especially for older folks who have limited income.I sent two large boxes of various clothing with a local church group going to a staging area to drop off supplies and volunteer where they could. I also sent cleaning supplies, toothbrushes and toothpaste, some bedding, pop-open soups and a case of water. Have you tried to find a manual can opener lately? They are few and far between.Bad ref calls during OSU game; time change comingI really don't want to say this, but the refs clearly won the game between the Ohio State Buckeyes and Oregon Ducks. A few bad calls toward the end of the game were obvious bad calls in my opinion and also that of Joel Klatt. He is still hashing it out on TV. Spitting in an opposing players face was one of the most disgusting things I've ever witnessed in a sport.If I were the coach, this person would be turning in his uniform and helmet. Intentionally sending 12 men to the field after a timeout was a blatant call by the opponent. Upward and onward Buckeyes. Show your class.As a reminder, Daylight Saving Time ends at 2 a.m. Nov. 3. The clock will fall back one hour.Let me leave you with this quotation by Paul Boese: \"Forgiveness is not changing the past, but it does enlarge the future.\"Until next week, be safe and be kind.",

    "title": "By using military against 'enemy within,' Trump would end democracy",
    "content": "As the 2024 presidential election enters its final phase, Donald Trump has gone full bore in following the frightening playbook of wannabe dictators. He also plans to dust off old laws that will allow him to carry out his anti-immigrant crusade and use the American military against people he calls the \"enemy within.\"At a rally in Aurora, Colo., on Oct. 11, the former president promised to be America's protector. He said that \"upon taking office we will have an Operation Aurora at the federal level\" and undertake a mass removal of illegal immigrants.Even as he has ramped up his chilling threats, his poll numbers have been rising. Parts of his message seem to be resonating with voters.To take one example, polls now show that \"More than half of all Americans, including a quarter of Democrats, support the mass deportation of immigrants who are living in the country illegally.\" Public support for such a draconian policy has increased by 11% since 2021.Last May, Trump made clear that he would \"have no problem using the military, per se,\" to deport millions of people. He now openly acknowledges that mass deportations would be \"a bloody story.\"The former president contends that laws meant to prevent the use of the military against civilians inside the United States would not be applicable if he ordered the military to round up migrants. \"These aren't civilians,\" Trump argues. \"These are people that aren't legally in our country. This is an invasion of our country.\"With just weeks left in the presidential campaign, and as Trump reiterates his plan to use the military against civilians and his political opponents, retired generals who served in the Trump administration need to step out of the shadows. People like James Mattis (Trump's first secretary of defense), John Kelly (who served as chief of staff) and Mark Milley (chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff) must come forward and remind voters about what they have said about the threat Trump poses to American democracy and the freedom that Americans now enjoy.In the meantime, what Trump said in Aurora cannot be dismissed as an off-the-cuff remark. Reading from his teleprompter, Trump promised that as soon as he got back to the Oval Office he would invoke \"the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 ... to target every migrant criminal network operating on American soil\" and expedite their removal.The way that act has been used in the past is a stain on our history.As the Brennan Center for Justice observes, \"The Alien Enemies Act of 1798 is a wartime authority that allows the president to detain or deport the natives and citizens of an enemy nation.\" The act refers specifically to \"invasions,\" which may explain why Trump regularly refers to the influx of illegal immigrants into this country in those terms.The law \"permits the president to target these immigrants without a hearing and based only on their country of birth or citizenship ... it can be -- and has been -- wielded against immigrants who have done nothing wrong, have evinced no signs of disloyalty, and are lawfully present in the United States.\"No wonder Trump can't wait to get his hands on it.If he does, he will follow in the footsteps of President Woodrow Wilson, who invoked it during World War I to target people from Germany living in the United States. The act also provided the legal basis for the infamous internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.Wilson continued to use the act after the war ended, a precedent followed by President Harry Truman, who relied on it for authority to continue the internment and deportations started under Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The Supreme Court upheld the Truman administration's extended reliance on the Alien Enemies Act.Can anyone imagine that the court's current MAGA majority would do anything different?Trump's speech at Aurora didn't stop with his remarks about the Alien Enemies Act. He went on to offer some thoughts about the role of the military if he is reelected.\"We have,\" Trump told a cheering audience, \"the greatest military in the world, but you have to know how to use them. It's the enemy from within. All the scum that we have to deal with that hate our country. That's a bigger enemy than China and Russia!\"A week ago, he reprised the \"enemy from within\" line in a Fox News interview.In response to a question about whether he was worried about violence on Election Day, the former president quickly pivoted to his usual anti-immigrant riff. \"I think,\" Trump insisted, \"the bigger problem is the enemy from within, not even the people that have come in and destroying our country and by the way, totally destroying our country. ... I think the bigger problem are the people from within.\"Leaving nothing to the imagination Trump went on to say, \"We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics. It should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard or, if really necessary, by the military.\"Though he did not say it to Fox, the former president plans, as the Brennan Center reports, \"to invoke the Insurrection Act, which allows the president to use the military as a domestic police force, on his first day in office.\" Like the Alien Enemies Act, the Insurrection Act has a long history.It was first enacted in 1792 and does not define what counts as \"insurrection\" and \"rebellion.\" The Insurrection Act was kept on the books a century later when Congress prohibited \"the president from using federal troops to enforce civilian law under most circumstances.\"Stirring up fear of internal enemies and radical leftists also has a long history. That history offers a troubling warning about Trump's musings about what he will do to people he considers \"very bad.\"That prospect underlines the urgency of the present moment. If Trump wins on Nov. 5, we would be left with freedom for those who do not offend the powerful, and repression -- enforced by the military -- for everyone else.Is that the future that people who spent their lives wearing the uniform of our country want for themselves or the branches of the armed forces that they led? If it is not, then Mattis, Kelly and Milley need to speak out loudly and repeatedly.Recall that in 2020, Mattis denounced Trump's plan to use the military against protesters after the murder of George Floyd. He warned that doing so would \"erode ... the moral ground that ensures a trusted bond between men and women in uniform and the society they are sworn to protect, and of which they themselves are a part.\"He said that Trump's behavior in office made a \"mockery of our Constitution.\"In 2023, Kelly went on the record to describe the former president as \"A person that has no idea what America stands for and has no idea what America is all about. ... A person who admires autocrats and murderous dictators. A person that has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution and the rule of law.\"And just this year, Milley apparently told The Washington Post's Bob Woodward that Trump is a \"fascist to the core\" and \"the most dangerous person to this country.\"Those retired military leaders, all of whom have served their country so well, can do so again by going on television and using social media every day to remind moderates and undecided voters of their warnings about Trump. There is no time to waste.Austin Sarat is the William Nelson Cromwell professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College. He wrote this for The Fulcrum.",

Enjoy a taste of Malaysia, everyday with Ayam Brand™ local pastes SHAH ALAM: Fact: Every time Malaysians travel abroad, we almost immediately miss the taste of home. You don't need to be homesick to celebrate Malaysia's rich culinary heritage when you can savor the authentic taste of Malaysia in your own home with Ayam Brand™ cooking pastes. Read more However, the programme was expanded to cover 52 million people across Indonesia, head of the Presidential Communications Office, Hasbi Hasan, said in a video released on BPJS Kesehatan's YouTube channel on September 25, 2024.\"The government will push for medical check-up(s),\" he added. In the first year of implementation, the new government will prepare hospitals and improve health services to support the program.\"In the first year in 2025, perhaps almost 30 new hospitals will be prepared. The capacity of first-level health services at Puskesmas (Community Health Centers) will also be seriously increased,\" he said. Besides health screenings, which were pursued by the Health Ministry under President Joko Widodo's government, the program will include comprehensive blood pressure, blood sugar, uric acid, and other screenings to detect potential catastrophic diseases, Hassan informed.Regular medical check-ups are considered necessary so that people can get to know the condition of their own health. They are also important to prevent non-communicable diseases and other catastrophic diseases.The program will be implemented as part of the government's efforts to improve public health through preventive measures and to increase public awareness by promoting a healthy lifestyle.\"So, a healthy lifestyle will also be promoted by the next government so that they are not only surprised when they fall ill, but they can prevent the disease. So, that is also part of a very important program,\" he explained.The planned budget allocation for the free medical check-up program is around Rp3.2 trillion, which will be sourced from the State Budget (APBN), according to data from the Ministry of Finance.The medical check-ups of 52 million people will be conducted once or twice a year. \"So, Indonesian people will be able to carry out routine medical check-ups once a year or twice a year,\" Hasan said.The 2023 Indonesian Health Survey (SKI) conducted by the Ministry of Health found a high prevalence of hypertension and diabetes, which are the main risk factors for heart and blood vessel diseases.Compared with the results of the Basic Health Research (Riskesdas) in 2018, the 2023 SKI showed a decline in the prevalence of hypertension.However, the incidence of diabetes mellitus in the population aged 15 years and above increased from 2.0 per cent to 2.2 per cent.Further, the incidence of the disease increased from 1.5 per cent to 1.7 per cent for all age groups.The increasing trend of diseases classified as catastrophic diseases must be addressed seriously by the government to achieve healthy and quality human resources.Realising healthy and quality human resources is one of the important priorities for President Prabowo's administration to realize a Golden Indonesia, in line with his vision of \"Moving Forward Together Toward Golden Indonesia 2045,\" which he has often highlighted since the election.To realize the vision, Prabowo and Gibran have devised eight missions called Astacita. One of the missions is to strengthen human resource development.Referring to the mission, Prabowo said that quality national development lies in the welfare of its people.Prabowo and Gibran believe that by making human resource development a top priority, Indonesia can build a strong foundation for future generations.In view of this, they are committed to building quality human resources, including by implementing a number of initiatives in the health sector.The free medical check-up program is considered important to improve the quality of public health with the help of preventive measures and by promoting a healthy lifestyle.",

The survey also finds dishonesty remaining a central theme of the election, with \"lies\" the most common word used in conjunction with Trump's campaign.That divide reflects something about each campaign's strategy with just over two weeks to go until Election Day. While both Harris and Trump have been holding rallies and speaking with podcasters, Harris has ramped up her media appearances. Trump, meanwhile, has held or will hold large-scale rallies -- including ones in solidly blue states like California and New York -- that, some of his advisers have argued, draw attention both from the media and from voters who typically tune out political content.The poll, conducted by SSRS and Verasight on behalf of a research team from CNN, Georgetown University and the University of Michigan, was fielded from October 11-14. During that time, the survey found, both candidates remained squarely in the public eye: 69 percent of Americans reported having heard, read or seen something related to Harris over the previous week, while a similar 73 percent said the same about Trump.And for both of them, mentions of the broadly defined topic of \"campaigning\" outpaced anything else. Mentions of the campaign made up 36 percent of the responses about Harris, and 28 percent of the responses about Trump, a 10-point rise for each candidate compared with the start of the month.But the specifics for each candidate differed. The word most commonly used in describing the news about Harris was \"interview,\" with Americans referencing her appearances on CBS' \"60 Minutes\" and the podcast \"Call Her Daddy,\" as well as interviews with Howard Stern and Stephen Colbert. The audiences for these appearances, the poll suggests, often varied broadly - the average age of respondents mentioning \"Call Her Daddy\" in reference to Harris was 32, for instance, while the average age of those mentioning \"60 Minutes\" was 52.\"(I) have heard many things about Kamala Harris in the last days,\" one respondent wrote. \"She is doing the media blitz everyone wanted.\"By contrast, when Americans were asked to describe the news about Trump, \"rally\" was the second-most commonly word used in response. Responses mentioned events that Trump held in cities ranging from Aurora, Colorado, to Coachella, California, as well as his plan for an upcoming rally in New York City's Madison Square Garden.\"I follow him on Instagram,\" wrote another respondent. \"He's been posting all of his political rallies there.\"Democrats, in particular, were also likely to mention Detroit. During remarks at the Detroit Economic Club, Trump called the city a \"developing area,\" warning that \"our whole country will end up being like Detroit\" if Harris wins the presidency.The poll's field dates came just after Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida -- and, like the survey conducted a week prior, it found substantial attention to recent storms, with \"hurricane\" among the top five words used in relation to both candidates. When Republicans talked about Trump's hurricane response, it was often in conjunction with the words \"victim\" or \"help,\" the poll found, while Democrats were more likely to mention it in the context of his spreading hurricane disinformation.The survey's results mark the fifth consecutive week during which \"lie\" was one of the top five words used in discussing Trump, and the first time it topped the list.\"I just hear him talking at his rallies on TV and all he does is LIE!\" one respondent wrote.The word has also been a fixture in responses relating to Harris, though neither as consistently nor as prominently. And the poll also finds that the sentiment of responses using the word \"lie\" is somewhat less negative when it comes to Harris than Trump -- possibly a reflection of some respondents using it in the context of Harris being lied about, rather than lying to others.\"I heard she is a liar,\" one respondent wrote. \"She isn't assisting with any of the two hurricanes that has happened in our nation.\"Another wrote: \"I read that Kamala Harris is pleading for people to stop lying about the hurricane relief and hurricane control.\"The sentiment behind the words Americans used to describe what they'd heard about Harris remained modestly more positive than the words they used to describe the news about Trump, but by a far smaller margin than the gaps seen following the Democratic National Convention and the ABC presidential debate. Sentiment doesn't refer to feelings about the candidates personally, but about how positively or negatively the terms and tones used to describe them tend to be framed.CNN's Jennifer Agiesta and Edward Wu contributed to this report.",

    "title": "2024 Election Showdown: Harris's America vs. Trump's Comeback Were Kamala Harris elected, the \"fundamental transformation of the United States of America\" into a one-party socialist redoubt would be complete. By Roger Kimball",
    "content": "A couple of days ago, The American Mind published a scary tale in which I pondered the question: what would America be like in the (admittedly unlikely) event that Kamala Harris should win the 2024 presidential election?The brief answer: it wouldn't be pretty.Although Harris has recently been pretending that she is in favor of border security (just as Donald Trump is), fracking (just as Donald Trump is), and law and order (ditto), she would quickly revert to form. The border would remain open and America's oil, gas, and coal would remain in the ground. Who knows what would happen to Trump's idea, also adopted by Harris, of exempting tips from federal income tax? We do know, however, that Harris would continue the Biden-Harris assault on free speech, weaponizing the DOJ against critics of her administration.Assuming the Dems got control of the Senate, Harris would pack the Supreme Court, reinstituting the left-wing bias that had prevailed throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Donald Trump and his close supporters would finally be neutralized, bankrupted, and jailed for life. The federal debt would continue to skyrocket, as would taxes and anything like economic innovation would be stamped out by regulatory zeal masquerading as environmental sensitivity. The left-wing sacrament of unrestricted abortion would be nationalized, nominally by the readoption of Roe v. Wade but in fact by the sanctification of infanticide. The discriminatory culture of ESG and DEI would be further institutionalized, thus undermining any support for meritocracy or such traditional values as colorblind justice.In short, though there would still be a place called the United States of America, the polity and the political values that existed under that name for nearly 250 years would have vanished, absorbed by the statist, freedom-tarnishing energies of an unaccountable administrative state. The masks would be dropped, the euphemisms retired. The basic hatred of what the United States has been would come to the fore. Harris gave us a little taste of what to expect in her remarks on Columbus Day (a holiday she wants to rebaptize as \"Indigenous Peoples' Day\"): \"European explorers,\" she said, \"ushered in a wave of devastation, violence, stealing land, and widespread disease.\" Were she elected, the \"fundamental transformation of the United States of America\" into a one-party socialist redoubt would be complete.As I say, I regaled readers with that horror story in my essay for The American Mind. Here I would like to offer a few thoughts on the alternative story: What if Donald Trump wins the election? What then?It is important to understand that Trump's election, supposing it happens, would be a process, not a single event. As I write, scarcely two weeks out from election day, pollsters are screaming that the race is \"a dead heat,\" \"too close to call.\" They warn that we may well see a reprise of Bush v. Gore in 2000, when the world was introduced to the phenomenon of the \"hanging chad\" and the election came down to a handful of votes in Broward County, Florida, and, then, the Supreme Court. If that is the case, the already-long election season, which starts well before November with early voting, absentee voting, and other expedients, is likely to dribble towards Thanksgiving or even later.As I have said on many occasions, I do not believe that will happen. Yes, I expect that the Democrats will cheat. There will, I predict, be a certain quote of posthumous voting, double, triple, or quadruple voting, and boxes of dubious votes from nursing homes, hospitals, prisons, and other institutions of the higher subterfuge. There may also be various \"anomalies\" introduced by the Dominion Vote Rigging Machines.Still, there is no COVID this time, and Republicans, though they are being outspent by a factor of at least 2 to 1, have a much stronger ground game than in the past. They also have at the top of the ticket the most charismatic politician since Ronald Reagan. Moreover, they have as their VP candidate the brilliant, articulate, and laser-focused J.D. Vance. They also have Elon Musk, RFK Jr., Vivek Ramaswamy, and Tulsi Gabbard.Then there is the GOP's secret weapon, the elephant in the room, the Empress With No Clothes. I mean, of course, Queen Kamala and her errant page Tampon-Tim Walz. The ambient static from the media is designed to distract us from the simple truth that they are fantastically bad candidates, deeply, irredeemably out of touch with most voters. Last week, I wrote about the campaign's horrible, no good, really bad week. Nothing in the following week, including Bret Baier's quiet but annihilating interview and her non-appearance at the Al Smith dinner, did anything to undo the damage.All of which means that the election will not be close. Trump will win in something close to a landslide. We will know the results late November 5 or sometime November 6. But that doesn't mean that he will simply coast into the Oval Office on January 20, 2025. Get ready for some serious insanity. The loser females in the pink hats at the mall at Trump's 2017 inauguration will seem like a garden club outing compared to what will happen this time. Expect the NeverTrumpers to reprise gambits like appealing to electors to betray their oaths and refuse to vote for Trump. Rep. Jeremy Raskin (D-MD) has already suggested that should Trump win, Congress should deploy Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to declare him ineligible to be seated.No, absent a successful assassination attempt, Trump will win comfortably.

    "title": "US-Ukraine Relations: Where Do Trump and Harris Stand?",
    "content": "As the United States prepares for the 2024 presidential election, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris will look to persuade Americans for their votes. The candidates will discuss their policy stances on a variety of topics, ranging from the economy, abortion rights, and education to border security, immigration, and foreign policy. Another important voter issue will be the Russian invasion of Ukraine.This is not the first time the US-Ukraine relationship will be a voter issue. The Eastern European state has played an important role in American politics over the past eight years. For example, during the 2016 presidential election, then-candidate Trump accused the Ukrainians of interfering in the US electoral process. He claimed the Ukrainians conspired against him and his campaign, and he stated that a Ukrainian company hacked a computer server belonging to the Democratic National Committee.The Federal Bureau of Investigation examined the claims made by then-candidate Trump. The organization found that there was \"zero evidence that Ukraine  anything to do with  server.\" In addition, beliefs that Ukraine had meddled in the 2016 election were debunked.Aside from investigation conducted by the FBI, members of the Trump-Pence administration also dismissed Ukrainian meddling. For example, Dr. Fiona Hill, the National Security Council's Senior Director for Europe and Russia under then-President Trump, stated that claims again Ukraine were fictitious. She also said that the \"fictions  harmful\" for US-Ukraine relations. Several other government officials who worked in the Trump administration agreed with Hill's statements, saying that Ukraine did not interfere in the 2016 presidential election.Beyond Trump's false accusations of Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, he also found himself in a serious matter with Ukraine. In July 2019, President Trump called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss US-Ukraine relations. During their meeting, President Trump requested that President Zelensky launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his family. The phone call occurred several days after President Trump had blocked a new shipment of defense aid to Ukraine.Members of the House of Representatives and Senate then launched an investigation to determine if President Trump broke the law by asking a foreign entity to aid him in a personal matter. Democratic members in the House unveiled two impeachment charges against President Trump. During the event, lawmakers argued that the president had abused his power while in office, and that he had obstructed Congress. The House voted to impeach President Trump, and after the impeachment, the Senate held trials for two months. While the votes in the Senate to convict the president was bipartisan, they were not enough to oust the president from office. The hold on Ukrainian aid was then dropped, and the US government sought to repair its relationship with Ukraine.Following these events, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were elected. After the 2020 US presidential election, the Biden-Harris administration has worked closely with Ukraine. From 2021 to 2024, the United States provided Ukraine with nearly $200 billion in aid. This has included defense, medical, humanitarian, and financial aid. Then, throughout Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the United States has said that it will stand with Ukraine \"for as long as it takes,\" and that it will continue to provide aid for as long as it can.Harris has also met with President Zelensky on seven occasions. Prior to the Russian full-scale invasion in February 2022, Harris traveled to Europe, where she met with Zelensky in Germany. During their meeting, she told him how the United States would react to a potential Russian invasion. The White House stated, \"Vice President Harris  been a strong proponent of enduring US support for Ukraine.\"More recently, Vice President Harris traveled to Switzerland during the Ukraine Peace Summit in June 2024. During her visit, she met with Zelensky to discuss the war and how the US could continue to provide aid to Ukraine. She also announced a new $1.5 billion aid package. Vice President Harris said that it was in America's \"interest to uphold international rules and norms,\" and that Ukraine has helped bolster \"America's security and prosperity.\"Now, millions of Americans are curious about what US-Ukraine relations may look like under President Trump and Vice President Harris. Recent statements and political platforms have provided important information.First, former President Trump. In a series of recent interviews, the former president stated that if he were to be elected, he would \"end the Russia-Ukraine war in one day.\" He claimed that he would force President Zelensky to meet with Vladimir Putin. The former president also argued that the US is providing too much support to Ukraine. On the campaign trail, he also said that Ukraine should be forced to compromise with Russia and that President Zelensky should negotiate with Putin.Trump restated his points during the presidential debate on Sept. 10. When asked about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the former president said that he knows President Putin \"very well,\" and that the Russian leader respects him. Then, when asked if it was in America's interest for Ukraine to win the war, the former president responded by saying that it was in the \"best interest to get the war finished.\" He did not answer, however, if Ukraine should win the war. Instead, he suggested that he would force Zelensky and Putin to speak with one another so that they can negotiate an end to the war.Following the debate, former President Trump held a series of campaign rallies in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia. During these events, he reiterated that the US was sending too much aid to Ukraine, and he argued that the US should be pressuring Ukraine to negotiate with Russia.\"Ukraine is gone, it  not Ukraine anymore,\" Trump said at his rally in North Carolina last week. \"You can never replace those cities and towns and you can never replace the dead people. \"If  a bad deal, it would have been much better.\" Instead, the US has \"continue to give billions of dollars to a man who refuses to make a deal , Zelensky.\" Ukraine should have \"given up a little bit\" to Russia, he added. In other words, former President Trump has implied that Ukraine should have succumbed to the Russian invasion rather than fighting for its sovereignty. He has also pushed for Ukraine to negotiate with Russia rather than continue the fight for independence.The former present then met with Zelensky in late September. During the meeting, the former American president said that he has a \"very good relationship\" with Putin, and he said that he was going to do what he could to bring an end to the war. When asked if his opinion on the Russian invasion of Ukraine had changed after meeting with President Zelensky, former President Trump said that his stance had not changed. Rather than offering to provide additional aid to Ukraine to help the Ukrainians to defeat Russia, Trump said that Ukraine must make a deal with Russia.Trump's stance on the Russian invasion of Ukraine is also shared by some members of US Congress. It is believed that Trump advised House and Senate Republicans to delay future assistance to Ukraine. From October 2023 to April 2024, Democrats and Republicans debated new foreign supplemental aid to the country. The assistance was first proposed in October 2023, but was put on hold during the holiday recess after Democrats and Republicans did not reach a consensus. The proposed aid package was finally passed by the Senate in February 2024, but the House continued to stall the bill. Eventually, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson brough the bill to a vote, and it was finally passed in April 2024, nearly seven months after the bill had been proposed.Finally, prominent Republicans gathered in Milwaukee in July for the Republican National Convention. During the three-day event, the Republicans announced their new party stance ahead of the election. The Russian invasion of Ukraine was not mentioned in the document, and a plan to support Ukraine and end the war was not presented. Instead, several members of the Republican Party echoed Trump stating that the war needs to end.In contrast, Harris has argued that \"it is in the strategic interest of the United States to continue\" its support for Ukraine. She supports a \"just and lasting peace\" for Ukraine, and that the US should continue to do what it can to help this Eastern European country.During the Democratic National Convention in August, the Democratic Party launched its new platform ahead of the election. In the platform report, the Democrats called for additional assistance to Ukraine. The Democrats stated they will \"stand with Ukraine to stop Putin's atrocities,\" and that they will work to \"constrain Russia's threat to allied nations and America's vital interests.\" Finally, during her speech at the Democratic National Convention, Vice President Harris said that she would \"stand strong with Ukraine.\"Harris echoed these points during the recent presidential debate. During the event, she was asked to comment on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In her response, she said that it is the duty of the US to ensure \"that there is stability , and ensuring that the  stands up for its principles.\" She also stated that through her work and the work of others, dozens of countries around the world came together to aid Ukraine during its time of need. Harris concluded that the US, its allies, and partners would continue to help \"preserve the ability of  Zelensky and the Ukrainians to fight for their independence.\"Finally, Harris recently met with Zelensky. During her meeting, she said that the US will continue to provide assistance to Ukraine during the invasion. She said that she would continue to help Ukraine stand up to Russia, and that she would work to ensure that \"Ukraine prevails in  war.\" She concluded that only Ukraine could conclude how the Russian invasion ends, and that the United States will stand strong with Ukraine.In short, both US presidential candidates have a long history with the Ukrainians. They have had visits with President Zelensky, and they have contributed to the US-Ukraine relationship. Previous engagements between the US and Ukraine during the Trump-Pence administration and the Biden-Harris administration show that both groups took different approaches to the US-Ukraine relationship. These events, as well as the recent presidential debate and their meetings with President Zelensky, also foreshadow what may come following the 2024 presidential election.Time will tell how the US-Ukraine relationship will unfold after the election. In the meantime, Americans and Ukrainians will await the results anxiously.",

    "title": "Our Current U.S. Government Is Unconstitutional As The 'Federal Borg,' An Unelected Fourth Branch Of Government, Has Declared War Against God And Middle-Class Prosperity",
    "content": "September 17 was Constitution Day, a day set aside for American patriots to commemorate the moment 237 years ago, when delegates to the Constitutional Convention signed that document. It's all the day when a prominent Philadelphia matron, Elizabeth Willing Powel, ambushed Benjamin Franklin as he left Constitution Hall. Spying Franklin, she pounced with the interrogatory, \"Well, Doctor, what have we got, a republic or a monarchy?\" This is the famous question to which Franklin uttered his famous response: \"A republic, if you can keep it!\"TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/Today's patriots commemorate this brief colloquy precisely because of the chilling fact that we haven't \"kept\" that republic. Since at least WWII, we have let the republic slip through our fingers with the exponential growth of the administrative state.In Washington Goes to War, David Brinkley details how the DC bureaucracy exploded during the war, aided in no small part by FDR's New Deal. Today, notwithstanding that the Constitution makes the federal government a republic and, in Article IV Section 4, guarantees that each of the 50 states is a republic, in all 51 jurisdictions, the republican form has been eclipsed by the administrative bureaucracy that dominates the federal and state governments.These administrative bureaucracies are, in effect, a fourth branch of the government in all 51 jurisdictions. These fourth branches are wholly unelected, hence nullifying self-government. These fourth branches enact more laws than their corresponding legislative branches and exercise their own powers of prosecution, adjudication, and sentencing.Because the personnel of these fourth branches are appointed by the corresponding executive branches and their superintendent deep states, these fourth branch personnel exhibit a distinct cyborg persona, which renders them adverse to the human citizens of the states. Although it might perhaps be justly claimed that we are still in the early stages of this Borg rule, the general outlines and conflicts of that rule are already clearly apparent.For this reason, the 2024 presidential election is only superficially labeled \"Trump versus Harris.\" Matthew G. Andersson noted it would more correctly be labeled \"Trump versus the Federal Borg.\" And Eric Utter recently pointed out that the US federal government has become a criminal organization.Although much work remains to be done to flesh out the full ramifications of this concept, even at this early stage of development, two specific Federal Borg wars can be clearly identified.(1) The Federal Borg War Against Middle-Class ProsperityThe Federal Borg has imported the migrant waves precisely because the invaders' dependency on the government is calculated to generate the votes that will keep the Federal Borg in power. Along with their political loyalty, they also bring crime, disease, chaos in education, and the dislocation of employment.(b) Banning Practical EnergyA recent Wall Street Journal editorial tells us that notwithstanding the proven sheer impracticality of it, the new greenhouse gas emissions rules that the Environmental Protection Agency promulgated require that battery-powered and plug-in hybrid vehicles constitute 32% of new automobile sales by 2027, and 71% by 2032. Never mind that EVs are vastly inferior to gasoline-powered vehicles and extremely dangerous because they catch fire in minor accidents.Still, coal, gas, and nuclear are out, and wind and solar are in. The hills are alive with solar and wind farms, but what do they plan for when the sun's not shining and the wind's not blowing? Where can you find a charging station when you need one, how long will it take to charge your EV, and how far can you drive before you next charge? Since one terrorist with a .22 rifle can take out a substation, we might want to contemplate life without electricity.(2) The Federal Borg War Against GodIn the fearsome smoke and thunder of Mount Sinai, YHVH made crystal clear that it matters to Him how the denizens of Solar III behave toward Him and toward each other, and He delivered ten commands to drive home the point. Searching the first five books of the Bible (also known as the \"Torah\"), the Jewish sages have ferreted out from the text of the scripture an additional 603 divine commands, making a total of 613 divine commands listed in the Old Testament alone. A handful of those commands that our federal government notoriously transgresses would include the following:(a) \"Choose Life\" (Deuteronomy 30:19)YHVH commands a pro-life stance and condemns a pro-death stance as profoundly immoral. Yet the sitting Vice President of the US federal government supports unlimited abortion. So does her party, which is the party of the Borg Federal Government and the deep state. The Democrat party is pro-death.",

    "title": "Judges punishing Jan. 6 rioters say they fear more political violence as Election Day nears - The Malta Independent",
    "content": "Over the past four years, judges at Washington's federal courthouse have punished hundreds of rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol in an unprecedented assault on the nation's democracy. On the cusp of the next presidential election, some of those judges fear another burst of political violence could be coming.Before recently sentencing a rioter to prison, U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton said he prays Americans accept the outcome of next month's election. But the veteran judge expressed concern that Donald Trump and his allies are spreading the same sort of conspiracy theories that fueled the mob's Jan. 6, 2021, riot.\"That sore loser is saying the same things he said before,\" Walton said earlier this month without mentioning the Republican presidential nominee by name. \"He's riling up the troops again, so if he doesn't get what he wants, it's not inconceivable that we will experience that same situation again. And who knows? It could be worse.\"Walton, a nominee of President George W. Bush, is not alone. Other judges have said the political climate is ripe for another attack like the one injured more than 100 police officers at the Capitol. As Election Day nears, judges are frequently stressing the need to send a message beyond their courtrooms that political violence can't be tolerated.\"It scares me to think about what will happen if anyone on either side is not happy with the results of the election,\" Judge Jia Cobb, a nominee of President Joe Biden, said during a sentencing hearing last month for four Capitol rioters.Judge Rudolph Contreras lamented the potential for more politically motivated violence as he sentenced a Colorado man, Jeffrey Sabol, who helped other rioters drag a police officer into the mob. Sabol later told FBI agents that a \"call to battle was announced\" and that he had \"answered the call because he was a patriot warrior.\"\"It doesn't take much imagination to imagine a similar call coming out in the coming months, and the court would be concerned that Mr. Sabol would answer that call in the same way,\" Contreras, a President Barack Obama nominee, said in March before sentencing Sabol to more than five years in prison.Trump's distortion of the Jan. 6 attack has been a cornerstone of his bid to reclaim the White House. The former president has denied any responsibility for the crimes of supporters who smashed windows, assaulted police officers and sent lawmakers running into hiding as they met to certify President Joe Biden's 2020 victory.Trump has vowed to pardon rioters, whom he calls \"patriots\" and \"hostages,\" if he wins in November. And he said he would accept the results of the upcoming election only if it's \"free and fair,\" casting doubts reminiscent of his baseless claims in 2020.Judges have repeatedly used their platform on the bench to denounce those efforts to downplay the violence on Jan. 6 and cast the rioters as political prisoners. And some have raised concerns about what such rhetoric means for the future of the country and its democracy.\"We're in a real difficult time in our country, and I hope we can survive it,\" Walton said this month while sentencing a Tennessee nurse who used a pair of medical scissors to smash a glass door at the Capitol.\"I've got a young daughter, I've got a young grandson, and I would like for America to be available to them and be as good to them as it has been to me,\" he added. \"But I don't know if we survive with the mentality that took place that day.\"More than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes related to Jan. 6 siege, which disrupted the peaceful transfer of presidential power for the first time in the nation's history. Over 1,000 rioters have been convicted and sentenced. Roughly 650 of them received prison time ranging from a few days to 22 years.Justice Department prosecutors have argued in many cases that a prison sentence is necessary to deter convicted Capitol rioters from engaging in more politically motivated violence.\"With the 2024 presidential election approaching and many loud voices in the media and online continuing to sow discord and distrust, the potential for a repeat of January 6 looms ominously,\" prosecutors have repeatedly warned in court filings.Prosecutors argue that defendants who have shown little or no remorse for their actions on Jan. 6 could break the law again. Some rioters even seem to be proud of their crimes.The first rioter to enter the Capitol texted his mother, \"I'll go again given the opportunity.\" A man from Washington state who stormed the Capitol with fellow Proud Boys extremist group members told a judge, \"You can give me 100 years and I'd do it all over again.\" A Kentucky nurse who joined the riot told a television interviewer that she would \"do it again tomorrow.\"A Colorado woman known to her social media followers as the \"J6 praying grandma\" avoided a prison sentence in August when a magistrate judge sentenced her for disorderly conduct and trespassing on Capitol grounds. Rebecca Lavrenz told the judge that God, not Trump, led her to Washington on Jan. 6.\"And she has all but promised to do it all over again,\" said prosecutor Terence Parker.Prosecutors had sought 10 months behind bars. After her April trial conviction, Lavrenz went on a \"media blitz\" to defend the mob, spread misinformation, undermine confidence in the courts and boost her celebrity in a community that believes Jan. 6 \"was a good day for this country,\" Parker said.Magistrate Zia Faruqui sentenced Lavrenz to six months of home confinement and fined her $103,000, stressing the need to \"lower the volume\" before the next election.\"These outside influences, the people that are tearing our country apart, they're not going to help you,\" Faruqui told her.",

    "title": "Moldova votes in election, EU referendum in shadow of alleged Russian meddling",
    "content": "Moldovans vote on Sunday (October 20, 2024) in a Presidential election and EU referendum at a pivotal moment that could bolster the small agricultural economy's drive to join the European Union, after allegations of Russian election meddling.As the war in Ukraine rages to the east and turns the political and diplomatic spotlight on the former Soviet republic, it has accelerated its push to escape Moscow's orbit and embarked on the long process of EU accession talks.Also read | Ukrainian and Moldovan entry could destabilise EU: RussiaPolls show pro-Western incumbent Maia Sandu has a comfortable lead over her 10 rivals on the ballot, though the race will go to a Nov. 3 run-off if she fails to reach the 50% threshold to win outright.Polls show she is likely to face Alexandr Stoianoglo, a former prosecutor-general backed by the traditionally pro-Russian Party of Socialists, if the vote goes to a second round.Sandu hopes to see a resounding \"yes\" at the referendum, which will decide whether to insert a clause into the constitution defining EU accession as a goal.\"Our fate is decided on Sunday. Everyone's vote matters, no matter where we are,\" she wrote on Facebook on Friday.Polls show a majority support joining the 27-nation bloc, though five of the candidates have told their supporters to vote \"No\" or boycott, saying the timing of the referendum is a ruse to boost Sandu's haul at the election.The referendum needs a turnout of at least a third of the people listed on electoral rolls for it to be deemed valid, even though the lists have not been updated in years despite many people emigrating.A weak outcome for Sandu would set the tone for next summer's parliamentary elections, where political analysts say her PAS party will face a challenge to retain its majority.Flanked by Romania and Ukraine, the nation of under 3 million people has alternated between pro-Western and pro-Russian courses since the 1991 Soviet breakup.Ties with Moscow have deteriorated since Sandu came to power in December 2020. Her government has condemned Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, accused Russia of plotting her overthrow and diversified energy supply after Russia reduced gas supplies.ALLEGED MEDDLINGThe campaign has been overshadowed by election-meddling allegations.The police have accused Ilan Shor, a fugitive tycoon who lives in Russia, of trying to pay off a network of at least 130,000 voters to vote \"No\" and back a specific candidate.Shor, who was jailed in absentia for fraud and theft and is under western sanctions, has openly offered to pay Moldovans to persuade others to vote \"No\" and back \"our candidate\". He denies wrongdoing and says the money is his.In the run-up to the vote, state radio in Chisinau has run adverts telling people not to vote for money and asking them to report any such offers to the authorities.On Thursday, law-enforcement agencies said they had uncovered a programme in which hundreds of people were taken to Russia to undergo training to stage riots and civil unrest.Russia denies interfering in Moldova and has long accused its government of \"Russophobia\".Police chief Viorel Cernauteanu told Reuters on Saturday there had been a slew of voice and text messages sent from abroad in recent days, telling Moldovans to either boycott the referendum or to vote \"No\".He said the police had done everything to prevent any impact on the vote.\"There will be some kind of impact in any case, but I think it will not influence the votes overall.\"Published - October 20, 2024 09:44 am ISTRead Comments",

    "title": "Austin Bay: Free world air-space defense must defeat super fast and very slow",
    "content": "Austin BayOn Oct. 13, a Hezbollah-launched unmanned aerial vehicle (drone) evaded Israel's air and space defense system. The slow suicide bomb struck a troop mess hall on an Israeli base about 40 miles from the Lebanon-Israel border.In this attack, Hezbollah launched two drones -- \"wingmen,\" in airpower slang. Israeli defenders shot one down over the Mediterranean Sea. The explosive drone \"that got through\" killed four Israeli Defense Forces soldiers and injured over 60.Four soldiers dead. That's the largest number of Israeli troops lost in an air or space weapon attack on a target within Israel since the Hamas atrocities and Iran's proxy war on Israel began in October 2023.The drone was a propeller-powered one-way bomb -- a cheap long-range killer.Aerial drones have a deadly -- and sneaky -- combat record. The U.S. Predator drone looked like the prank mating of a toy propeller airplane and a bald duck, not a potent emblem of American 21st-century hyper-war. Despite its slow speed, it caught terrorists in Yemen, Somalia, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq by surprise. They didn't anticipate its computer brain, digital nerves and crosshair robotic eyes connected to CIA operators pulling the trigger.The Iranian drone Hezbollah used was the smart and digitally programmable equivalent of a Nazi Germany V-1 buzz bomb -- a one-way suicide missile.Why did it get through Israel's sophisticated air and space defense system? According to a couple of wire service reports quasi-quoting Israeli sources, Hezbollah used the wingman drone and a rocket barrage to confuse Israeli defenses.But being small and slow can be a plus. In 1987 a (West) German teen in a single-engine Cessna evaded Soviet Russian air defenses.Recall, in 1983 Soviet fighters shot down (South) Korean Air Lines Flight 007 after it accidentally entered Russian airspace. Two hundred sixty-nine human beings died.1987: The teenager, Mathias Rust, flew from Finland and landed his aircraft near Red Square. He was detected, but his detectors dismissed his plane as a nuisance or -- a bird?My tactical, operational and strategic point: Rust's air defense-evading Cessna is an odyssey akin to deadly 2024 one-way drones.Iranian prop drones fly slowly. Many are made of plastic/ceramic components, hence a weak radar reflection. Flying low makes their target trajectory tough to estimate.The background headline to this column is Israel's fabulous success in air-space defense. Since April -- after Iran's first ballistic missile and long-range drone attack on Israel -- I've written two columns examining the Israeli air-space antimissile and antiaircraft systems.These expensive, complex but so necessary defensive systems work. On Oct. 1, Iran fired some 180 missiles into Israeli territory. The missile attack was defeated, like the April 13-14 attack, when Iran fired 350 to 370 long-range drones, ballistic missiles and cruise missiles.The \"fast movers\" -- ballistic missiles -- and slower systems -- cruise missiles and long-range drones -- were detected and shot down.The April and October Israeli successes should be U.S. 2024 presidential election issues. For over two decades, often-hysterical opposition from the American political left stalled deployment of an operational missile shield. Their hysteria was a fossil rite drawing on their Cold War opposition to President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.In 2003, then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi opined: \"The United States does not need a multi-billion-dollar national missile defense against the possibility of a nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile. What we need is a strong nonproliferation policy with other nations to combat the most serious threat to our national security.\"Sad -- very dead wrong.Thanks to American and Israeli antimissile programs, we can stop the fast movers.We can stop the short-range slow movers. Aircraft and space \"look-down/shoot-down\" platforms -- including balloons and helicopters -- can detect. Acoustic systems can hear drone engines. Thermal detectors identify engine heat. Drone versus drone -- not so sci-fi. Cheap anti-drone drone squadrons can loiter for weeks, then perform \"suicide\" interception of attackers.Ukraine uses .50-caliber machine guns directed by human eyes. If it sounds World War II -- the drone still goes down.Austin Bay is a syndicated columnist and author.Copy the Story LinkSend questions/comments to the editors.Related Stories Latest Articles",

    "content": "Pennsylvania is undoubtedly a focal point in the 2024 presidential election. Residents have become accustomed to endless TV ads, stuffed mailboxes, and even the occasional canvasser knocking on their doors. Both campaigns have been relentlessly criss-crossing the state looking for any advantage in a race with razor-thin margins.Recent rumors have circulated that internal polling from both camps is starting to show a swing in momentum toward the Trump campaign. Trump and his surrogates have been pressing that advantage with events and rallies in the Greater Pittsburgh region. But evidence of Trump's momentum may have come from Senator Bob Casey.Casey is running for reelection against Dave McCormick and, until recently, had a comfortable 9-point lead. The polls have tightened and are now within the margin of error. Casey has been avoiding Harris like the plague, then he released this ad on Friday. Those internals must be brutal!Meanwhile, in Oakmont, PA the famous Oakmont Bakery is also running a poll. Cookies with images of both candidates are being sold and the results aren't even close!That's a pretty good start to the weekend for Team Trump. Saturday would bring another huge crowd at a rally in Latrobe, PA. A couple of former Steeler greats would get the crowd fired up.Antonio Brown and LeVeon Bell may not make national news, but this is Pittsburgh, and they were Steelers.But the night's biggest surprise would come when Donald Trump called local Steel Workers to the stage.Union voters have been the lifeblood of Democrat politics in Pennsylvania for generations. Rank and file Steel Workers joining Teamsters, Firefighters, and Police supporting Trump could mean big trouble for Kamala Harris! No wonder Casey is putting as much distance as possible between himself and Harris.Trump's weekend doesn't end in Latrobe. The Steelers are playing the New York Jets on Sunday night and Trump will be attending the game.Trump hanging out with 70,000 screaming Yinzers after a solid 10-hour tailgate party! Now that's must-see TV! Speaking of tailgating, campaign surrogates will be making a day of it as well.There you have it. Trump is surging, Casey is reeling, and Kamala?

    "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Over the past four years, judges at Washington's federal courthouse have punished hundreds of rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol in an unprecedented assault on the nation's democracy. On the cusp of the next presidential election, some of those judges fear another burst of political violence could be coming.Before recently sentencing a rioter to prison, U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton said he prays Americans accept the outcome of next month's election. But the veteran judge expressed concern that Donald Trump and his allies are spreading the same sort of conspiracy theories that fueled the mob's Jan. 6, 2021, riot.\"That sore loser is saying the same things he said before,\" Walton said earlier this month without mentioning the Republican presidential nominee by name. \"He's riling up the troops again, so if he doesn't get what he wants, it's not inconceivable that we will experience that same situation again.

Sabol later told FBI agents that a \"call to battle was announced\" and that he had \"answered the call because he was a patriot warrior.\"\"It doesn't take much imagination to imagine a similar call coming out in the coming months, and the court would be concerned that Mr. Sabol would answer that call in the same way,\" Contreras, a President Barack Obama nominee, said in March before sentencing Sabol to more than five years in prison.Trump's distortion of the Jan. 6 attack has been a cornerstone of his bid to reclaim the White House. The former president has denied any responsibility for the crimes of supporters who smashed windows, assaulted police officers and sent lawmakers running into hiding as they met to certify President Joe Biden's 2020 victory.Trump has vowed to pardon rioters, whom he calls \"patriots\" and \"hostages,\" if he wins in November. And he said he would accept the results of the upcoming election only if it's \"free and fair,\" casting doubts reminiscent of his baseless claims in 2020.Judges have repeatedly used their platform on the bench to denounce those efforts to downplay the violence on Jan. 6 and cast the rioters as political prisoners. And some have raised concerns about what such rhetoric means for the future of the country and its democracy.\"We're in a real difficult time in our country, and I hope we can survive it,\" Walton said this month while sentencing a Tennessee nurse who used a pair of medical scissors to smash a glass door at the Capitol.\"I've got a young daughter, I've got a young grandson, and I would like for America to be available to them and be as good to them as it has been to me,\" he added. \"But I don't know if we survive with the mentality that took place that day.\"More than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes related to Jan. 6 siege, which disrupted the peaceful transfer of presidential power for the first time in the nation's history.

    "title": "Trump Delivers Urgent Message To Pennsylvania Voters After Telling Risqué Story About Golf Legend's MANHOOD - Ny Breaking News",
    "content": "Donald Trump delivered an urgent message to supporters in Pennsylvania on Saturday, urging them to register to vote before a looming deadline, but not before telling a rather intimate story about golfing great Arnold Palmer.The seven-time major championship winner grew up near Latrobe Airport, which is now named in his honor.Trump entertained his supporters as the sun set with the story of Palmer's early life, describing how the talented young golfer rose to become a wealthy champion who bought the local golf club and put his father in charge.But that wasn't the most impressive part of his life, Trump added, warming to the theme.\"Arnold Palmer is all man,\" he said.Former President Donald Trump appeared before thousands of supporters at Pennsylvania's Arnold Palmer Regional Airport on Saturday evening'I mean no disrespect to women, I love women, but he was all man.\"When he went to take a shower with the other professionals, they came out and said, 'Oh my God.' I had to tell you...I had to tell you the shower part because it's true.\"That's what the crowd came for, a few celebrity stories mixed with a dose of Dem bashing.After delighting the crowd with that salacious story, Trump got down to the serious business of the evening: laying out the stakes of what he said was the most important election in the country's history.Monday is the deadline to register to vote in Pennsylvania. And nowhere is the race closer.Trump will spend the weekend campaigning from west to east, from Pittsburgh to Pennsylvania, in a sign of its importance.\"If we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole damn thing,\" he told several thousand supporters gathered on the airport tarmac.Trump is all in for Pennsylvania this weekend.On Sundays he mans a McDonald's fry station near Philadelphia, has a town hall in Lancaster and will be at the Pittsburgh Steelers game in the evening.His speech included all his greatest hits: exaggerated crowd sizes, complaints about a \"weaponized\" justice system and a promise to tell Vice President Kamala Harris, \"You're fired.\"Trump spends two days in Pennsylvania before the voter registration deadlineArnold Palmer won seven major championships and grew up near the airport now named in his honor, just outside PittsburghTrump's plane delighted fans when it landed on Saturday eveningFormer Pittsburgh Steeler Antonio Brown got the crowd moving before Trump arrivedBut he also revealed that he had spoken during the day with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a leader who is at a crucial juncture amid the war in the Middle East and is weighing when and how to attack Iran.The main message, however, was to encourage supporters to vote early and beat the Democrats at their own game\"Early voting in Pennsylvania is now underway. Just go and vote,\" he said. \"If you haven't registered to vote, you have two days.\"He told his crowd that their vote will decide \"whether we give up America, or whether we save America.\"And he promised them a 'new golden age'.\"A hundred years from now, the 2024 presidential election will be seen as America's greatest victory,\" he said. 'We have been through so much together and the finish line is finally in sight.'Pennsyvlania has 19 electoral college votes, making it a key battlegroundJL Partners surveyed 800 likely voters in Pennsylvania about their voting intentions from October 5 to 8 using a variety of methods. The results have a margin of error of 3.5 percentOf the seven swing state battlegrounds, Pennsylvania is the most consistent.The state is likely to be the turning point in the elections. The 19 electoral college votes could push one or the other candidate past the threshold for victory on November 5.To win, Trump needs high turnout in the deep-red counties surrounding the working-class city of Pittsburgh, to counter Harris' support in major metropolitan areas.Trump won the state in 2016 by fewer than 70,000 votes. Four years later he lost it by slightly more.The latest survey from DailyMail.com/JL Partners shows this couldn't be closer.If the election were to take place tomorrow, each candidate would win 47 percent of the vote.Harris spent Saturday at a voting event in Detroit, Michigan, along with Michigan-born rapper Lizzo, on the first day of early voting.She would then travel to Atlanta, Georgia, for a meeting with pop singer Usher.",

    "title": "The One Stat the Media Underplays Because It Will Sink Trump",
    "content": "For the next 16 days expect to hear non stop white noise. Political news is like static on a television set after the broadcast signal is shut off. But if you keep reading enough articles there are repetitive themes that keep cropping up which will help you find out what you need to know. The most repetitive theme is that the polls indicate the 2024 presidential election is a nail biting race. This sets most of us to ripping our hair out. But bear in mind, you know how far off the polls can be, at least if you remember 2016, 2018, 2020 and 2022, with particular emphasis on 2016 and 2022. So forget about the polls as an indicator one way or the other.What does that leave you? A lot. An awful lot. Here's the basic lay of the land:Now, bearing all that in mind, here's what Trump's plan was and here's why it's flopping. And yes, I'm going to tell you the one statistic. Very simply, Trump needs an unpopular candidate, like Hillary was, or a candidate who aged in the job, as Joe did, and he doesn't have that right now to attack. He also -- and this is key -- does not have the advantage of being the untried product. Back in 2016, Trump was the Shell Answer Man, he knew what to do and only he could do it. We saw what he did for four years in office. We saw it all too well.So everything mentioned here is a factor. But there is one factor which isn't being mentioned and it's the very one that will hang Trump: voter turnout. 2016 was a low turnout election with two \"flawed\" candidates, as it was put at the time. 2020 was a higher turnout election and so far, 2024 is looking to be high turnout as well. Georgia, Michigan, and Pennsylvania smashed voting records when early and mail-in voting started.That is the Rosetta Stone of this election, I believe. Trump must have a low voter turnout to win and he doesn't have it. And on top of that, Trump's Get Out The Vote effort is flailing. He's got no ground game, he's got no volunteers, he's outsourced his Get Out The Vote effort (I guess he didn't ask Ron DeSantis how that went, when DeSantis tried it) and the Democrats are out-fundraising the Republicans by an incredible margin.So all of these factors should be taken into account but none so much as the voter turnout. Because that is what is going to determine this race. And the pollsters can tap dance about how Kamala's numbers need to come up with male voters, bla bla, but it's all empty rhetoric if there's terrific early voting, mail-in voting and in person voting at the polls on Election Day.Keep your eyes on early and mail-in voting stats. That will give you an overall concept of how the turnout will be this election. And if it's a high turnout election, look for Trump to sink like an anvil.",

As Election Day nears, judges are frequently stressing the need to send a message beyond their courtrooms that political violence can't be tolerated.\"It scares me to think about what will happen if anyone on either side is not happy with the results of the election,\" Judge Jia Cobb, a nominee of President Joe Biden, said during a sentencing hearing last month for four Capitol rioters.Judge Rudolph Contreras lamented the potential for more politically motivated violence as he sentenced a Colorado man, Jeffrey Sabol, who helped other rioters drag a police officer into the mob. Sabol later told FBI agents that a \"call to battle was announced\" and that he had \"answered the call because he was a patriot warrior.\"\"It doesn't take much imagination to imagine a similar call coming out in the coming months, and the court would be concerned that Mr. Sabol would answer that call in the same way,\" Contreras, a President Barack Obama nominee, said in March before sentencing Sabol to more than five years in prison.Trump's distortion of the Jan. 6 attack has been a cornerstone of his bid to reclaim the White House. The former president has denied any responsibility for the crimes of supporters who smashed windows, assaulted police officers and sent lawmakers running into hiding as they met to certify President Joe Biden's 2020 victory.Trump has vowed to pardon rioters, whom he calls \"patriots\" and \"hostages,\" if he wins in November. And he said he would accept the results of the upcoming election only if it's \"free and fair,\" casting doubts reminiscent of his baseless claims in 2020.Judges have repeatedly used their platform on the bench to denounce those efforts to downplay the violence on Jan. 6 and cast the rioters as political prisoners. And some have raised concerns about what such rhetoric means for the future of the country and its democracy.\"We're in a real difficult time in our country, and I hope we can survive it,\" Walton said this month while sentencing a Tennessee nurse who used a pair of medical scissors to smash a glass door at the Capitol.\"I've got a young daughter, I've got a young grandson, and I would like for America to be available to them and be as good to them as it has been to me,\" he added. \"But I don't know if we survive with the mentality that took place that day.\"More than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes related to Jan. 6 siege, which disrupted the peaceful transfer of presidential power for the first time in the nation's history. Over 1,000 rioters have been convicted and sentenced. Roughly 650 of them received prison time ranging from a few days to 22 years.Justice Department prosecutors have argued in many cases that a prison sentence is necessary to deter convicted Capitol rioters from engaging in more politically motivated violence.\"With the 2024 presidential election approaching and many loud voices in the media and online continuing to sow discord and distrust, the potential for a repeat of January 6 looms ominously,\" prosecutors have repeatedly warned in court filings.Prosecutors argue that defendants who have shown little or no remorse for their actions on Jan. 6 could break the law again. Some rioters even seem to be proud of their crimes.The first rioter to enter the Capitol texted his mother, \"I'll go again given the opportunity.\" A man from Washington state who stormed the Capitol with fellow Proud Boys extremist group members told a judge, \"You can give me 100 years and I'd do it all over again.\" A Kentucky nurse who joined the riot told a television interviewer that she would \"do it again tomorrow.\"A Colorado woman known to her social media followers as the \"J6 praying grandma\" avoided a prison sentence in August when a magistrate judge sentenced her for disorderly conduct and trespassing on Capitol grounds. Rebecca Lavrenz told the judge that God, not Trump, led her to Washington on Jan. 6.\"And she has all but promised to do it all over again,\" said prosecutor Terence Parker.Prosecutors had sought 10 months behind bars. After her April trial conviction, Lavrenz went on a \"media blitz\" to defend the mob, spread misinformation, undermine confidence in the courts and boost her celebrity in a community that believes Jan. 6 \"was a good day for this country,\" Parker said.Magistrate Zia Faruqui sentenced Lavrenz to six months of home confinement and fined her $103,000, stressing the need to \"lower the volume\" before the next election.\"These outside influences, the people that are tearing our country apart, they're not going to help you,\" Faruqui told her.",

    "content": "The star of a documentary series that gripped viewers worldwide during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic is now in his own state of quarantine in Texas. Joseph Maldonado-Passage, better known as Joe Exotic of the Netflix series Tiger King, said recently that he is one of 140 inmates at Federal Medical Center in Fort Worth infected with scabies.Maldonado-Passage told TMZ on Oct. 11 that the prison didn't have enough medication to treat all of the infected inmates, and that about 300 of them, including himself, were in quarantine.The Dallas Morning News on Tuesday received confirmation from the prison that one of its housing units had experienced a scabies outbreak.One of Maldonado-Passage's lawyers told the Morning News that their client had experienced unsanitary conditions including seeing rats in beds. The prison denied this assertion to the Morning News.\"We make every effort to ensure the physical safety and health of the individuals confined to our facilities through a controlled environment that is secure and humane,\" a spokesperson for the prison told the Morning News.Maldonado-Passage, 61, is serving a 21-year sentence in prison for plotting to kill Carole Baskin, the CEO of Big Cat Rescue in Hillsborough County, Fla. The documentary Tiger King, which garnered plenty of attention after its release in March 2020, chronicled the feud between Baskin and Maldonado-Passage, a big-cat collector and private zoo owner.While imprisoned, Maldonado-Passage, who claimed he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer, announced his candidacy in the 2024 presidential election. Originally he sought a place on the Libertarian Party ticket, but one month later he changed to Democrat. In August, Maldonado-Passage ended his campaign and announced his support for President Donald Trump.",

    "content": "Dominion Voting Systems, which manufactures voting machines used across the U.S., says it is prepared to counter \"lies\" and \"seek accountability from those who spread them\" regarding its voting systems and election integrity following a revival of 2020 conspiracy claims from Elon Musk and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene.In the past few years, Dominion has been at the center of several election integrity conspiracy theories. In 2020, supporters of former President Donald Trump falsely claimed that Dominion machines had \"flipped\" votes from Trump to President Joe Biden. Others claimed the machines deleted Trump votes altogether.Despite the claims being repeatedly debunked, Representative Greene and tech billionaire Musk separately cast doubt on Dominion systems in speeches this week.Dominion has filed dozens of lawsuits against individuals and media organizations that have spread the misinformation. Fox News settled one suit for $787.5 million.In a Saturday update on its webpage titled \"Setting the Record Straight: Facts About Dominion,\" the company reiterated that the claim has been \"repeatedly debunked.\" It also noted that \"a record-breaking 1.1 million voters in the state of Georgia\" have cast their ballots using Dominion machines. Georgia is a key battleground state in the tight 2024 presidential election.The update comes the day after Greene, a Trump loyalist, said during an interview with Infowars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones that \"someone\" saw their Trump vote change after casting a ballot on a Dominion machine this year in Georgia. She also wrote on social media that it happened in her district in Whitfield County, Georgia.\"They marked Donald Trump and they marked who they were voting for the rest of the way down their ballot on the machine,\" Greene said. \"When this voter printed their ballot and they looked, it had changed. It was not Donald Trump, it was not me and it was not the other ones they had voted for. It had switched.\"\"So they had to start over, and they went through it several times and it kept on making the same error,\" she continued. \"It kept on switching the votes.... It sounds similar to what we heard in 2020.\"A Dominion spokesperson told Newsweek on Friday that the company \"has been the target of ongoing defamation, including long-debunked claims\" like the one Greene pushed on Friday.In the Saturday update, Dominion wrote on its website, \"The false claim that voting machines can switch votes has been repeatedly debunked. As both state and local election authorities have confirmed, the issue reported in Whitfield County was due to voter error. The county provided the voter with an opportunity to mark and print a new ballot with their correct choices and the issue was quickly resolved.\"Newsweek has reached out to Greene's campaign for comment via email on Saturday.At his first solo event supporting Trump's presidential campaign on Thursday, Musk responded to a question about election fraud, sarcastically remarking it must be a coincidence that Dominion voting machines were used in Philadelphia and Maricopa County, Arizona, two battleground states won by President Joe Biden in 2020.Dominion issued a statement following the event, clarifying that its machines were not used in Philadelphia. \"These are not matters of opinion. They are verifiable facts,\" Dominion said in its statement.Dominion voting systems are certified by the U.S. government.",
