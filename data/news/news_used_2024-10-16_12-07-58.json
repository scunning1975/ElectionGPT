    "title": "FBI 'Quietly Revises' Violent Crime Stats",
    "content": "Last year, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) initially issued its \"final\" nationwide crime data for 2022, the bureau reported that the country's violent crime rate decreased by 2.1 percent. Democrats quickly latched onto this purported percent change to counter Donald Trump's claims that crime is soaring under the Biden-Harris administration.However, a year later, the FBI has \"quietly revised\" those numbers, according to a RealClearInvestigations report by crime watchdog Dr. John Lott, correcting the dataset to show that violent crime actually increased in 2022 by 4.5 percent. This means the FBI was way off -- by 6.6 percentage points. These additions include thousands more murders, rapes, robberies, and aggravated assaults, Lott says.The federal law enforcement made no mention of this \"stealth edit\" in its September 2024 press release.Lott, who served as senior adviser for research and statistics in the Office of Justice Programs and the Office of Legal Policy at the U.S. Justice Department, discovered this correction through \"a cryptic reference\" on the FBI website stating: \"The 2022 violent crime rate has been updated for inclusion in CIUS, 2023.\" The vague editor's note did not disclose that those figures increased. Lott says the change can only be seen by downloading the FBI's newly edited crime data and comparing it to the initial file released in 2023.According to Lott's analysis, the revisions are \"extensive.\" There were 80,029 more violent crimes than in 2021, including an additional 1,699 murders, 7,780 rapes, 33,459 robberies, and 37,091 aggravated assaults. How did the FBI originally miss so many murders, given that the vast majority of them are reported to authorities?\"The question naturally arises: should the FBI's 2023 numbers be believed?\" Lott also asks, as the FBI's initial underreporting casts doubt on the reliability of its data past and present. Data hawks are also wondering whether the federal agency is fudging the numbers and raising concerns of data manipulation in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election.It's been more than three weeks since the FBI released the revised 2022 data, and it has yet to make a public announcement explaining the discrepancy. \"The Bureau's lack of acknowledgment or explanation about the significant change concerns researchers,\" Lott observes.\"This FBI report is stunning because it now doesn't state that violent crime in 2022 was much higher than it had previously reported, nor does it explain why the new rate is so much higher, and it issued no press release about this large revision,\" David Mustard, a professor at the University of Georgia who extensively researches crime, told Lott. \"This lack of transparency harms the FBI's credibility.\"\"I have checked the data on total violent crime from 2004 to 2022,\" Carl Moody, a professor at the College of William & Mary who specializes in studying crime, commented. \"There were no revisions from 2004 to 2015, and from 2016 to 2020, there were small changes of less than one percentage point. The huge changes in 2021 and 2022, especially without an explanation, make it difficult to trust the FBI data.\"\"It is up to the FBI to explain what they have done, and they haven't explained these large changes,\" Dr. Thomas Marvell, president of Justec Research, a criminal justice statistical research organization, remarked.The FBI did not respond to Lott's repeated requests for comment.Lott notes that the FBI's revisions reveal how much guesswork is truly involved.As Townhall previously covered, the FBI's calculations are not based on simply counting crimes. Instead, it offers estimates by extrapolating data from police departments that report only partial-year data. This includes estimations for cities that fail to report any data to the federal government. According to reporting rates monitored by the Marshall Project, nearly one-third of local law enforcement agencies (31 percent of the 18,000) were MIA from the FBI's 2022 crime statistics.According to how the U.S. Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics describes the estimation model:\"It is the statistical process which allows inferences to be made about an outcome of interest in a population (e.g., the number of murders in the United States), even if information about the outcome is only known for part of the population  Not all law enforcement agencies submit all their crime data; some provide only partial data, or no data at all, on crimes and arrests.\"In other words, the FBI figures are \"a guess - albeit an informed guess - built on assumptions to fill in data that is often otherwise known (i.e., the number of homicides in Los Angeles in 2021 - 402),\" says the Coalition for Law, Order, and Safety (CLOS), a public safety group comprised of law enforcement officials and analysts. Because the Los Angeles Police Department did not submit data, the FBI inferred what the number would likely have been, despite the data being publicly available.The FBI's process for estimating unreported figures has \"long been a black box,\" Jeffrey Anderson, who served as director of the Bureau of Justice Statistics from 2017 to 2021, wrote for City Journal.Anderson said that when he headed the Bureau of Justice Statistics, \"We definitely would have highlighted in a press release or a report the 6.6% change recorded for 2022, which moved the numbers from a drop to a rise in violent crime.\"Another issue with the FBI crime data is its reliance on reported crimes, Lott notes. Many crimes go unreported; only about 45 percent of violent victimizations and 30 percent of property crimes were brought to the police's attention in 2023, according to the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS).Since the FBI only tracks reported incidents, researchers caution that when the media pounce on preliminary crime rates generated by FBI data, they should clarify that it reflects \"reported\" crime but does not accurately capture America's crime crisis.Meanwhile, other measurements show sharper rises in crime.",

    "title": "Is swing state business in better shape than it was four years ago? Here's what the data says",
    "content": "Five of the seven swing states in the 2024 presidential election improved their overall business climates during the Biden-Harris administration, according to CNBC's annual America's Top States for Business study. But that does not necessarily mean the states are better off economically, in an election cycle where the economy has consistently ranked at or near the top of voters' concerns.Since 2007, CNBC has been ranking all 50 states across ten categories of competitiveness to determine the best overall states in which to do business. Behind the rankings are dozens of metrics that offer a detailed picture of each state's business and economic climate.We compared the most recent rankings, published in July, with those from 2019 -- the last full year of data before the Covid-19 pandemic, and in many ways the peak of the Trump economy. Of the seven biggest battlegrounds in terms of polling and Electoral College heft, only Nevada and Wisconsin saw their overall rankings decline.The other 5 swing states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania -- all improved their standing.Of course, competitiveness is complicated. It often has every bit as much, or more, to do with state policies than what is happening in Washington. Still, there are plenty of statistics for both the Trump and Harris campaigns to either claim credit for, or to run away from.Here is how the business climates break down in the battlegrounds.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. first announced in 2020 that it would make its U.S. home in Arizona with a $12 billion investment -- a big win for the Trump administration.But Arizona's semiconductor industry, which dates back to Motorola in the 1950s, really took off with the CHIPS and Science Act, signed into law by President Biden in 2022.Spurred by $6.6 billion in CHIPS Act funding, TSMC has raised its Arizona investment to $65 billion, including three giant chip fabrication plants. Intel is investing $30 billion. And Arizona now ranks third behind California and Texas for semiconductor manufacturing and related facilities, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.The state has the infrastructure to handle all this development, including one of the nation's most reliable power grids. But it is struggling in other areas, like the rising cost of living.Arizona's Workforce ranking falls to No. 6, as state workforce training programs try to keep up with demand. And the state ranks No. 47 for education, with large class sizes and underfunded schools. Last year, TSMC announced it was delaying until 2025 the start of production in Arizona -- which had been scheduled for this year -- due to a labor shortage.The Biden administration designated Phoenix as a Workforce Hub under another CHIPS and Science Act program designed to encourage public-private partnerships, and to nourish Arizona's relatively dry talent pipeline.Georgia's top ranked Infrastructure puts The Peach State at the heart of any company's location search. The state has always been a powerhouse in that area, starting with the world's busiest airport -- Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International. The airport is getting a $45 million facelift under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.But much of Georgia's infrastructure prowess is homegrown, including the state's well-regarded site readiness program, Georgia Ready for Accelerated Development (GRAD), which currently offers 60 shovel-ready sites. That has helped the state become a center for electric vehicle production, with Kia, Hyundai and Rivian all locating facilities there. The Georgia Department of Economic Development boasts more than $27 billion in EV investments since 2018.The Inflation Reduction Act, for which Vice President Kamala Harris cast the deciding vote in 2022, aims to boost the EV industry with new and extended tax credits. But Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, has claimed that the IRA has done the opposite by pushing the industry too fast and fanning a backlash against the technology.Georgia ranks 40th for Quality of Life due to poor health care, weak worker protections, and a six-week abortion ban, which the Georgia Supreme Court reinstated this month.Michigan burst into the top ten in 2023, moving up to ninth place this year, following years of mediocrity.The Wolverine State is a supremely affordable place to live, with the nation's third lowest Cost of Living. Michigan's Cost of Doing Business ranking is solid too, thanks in large part to generous incentives. And the state has improved its Business Friendliness ranking by cutting regulations.All of this has made Gov. Gretchen Whitmer a rising Democratic star, and a busy surrogate for the Harris campaign. In 2022, Michigan Democrats achieved their first trifecta in state government in 40 years, winning control of both houses of the state legislature in addition to the governorship. The new majority promptly repealed Michigan's right to work law, approved new protections against discrimination and enshrined abortion rights.Whitmer promised that those changes would help attract workers to the state, but it has not worked out that way yet. Michigan lags the nation in attracting workers, according to Top States data.Economic growth was sluggish last year, though there have been signs of an upturn to start 2024. The slowdown in the electric vehicle industry forced Ford Motor to scale back its plans for a $3.5 billion battery plant in Michigan. The state, in turn, scaled back the $1.7 billion in incentives it was prepared to pay, revising the package to $409 million.Nevada's highest in the nation unemployment rate -- 5.5% as of August -- is nothing to brag about. And it can't help the mood of the voters as Election Day approaches. But for employers, it means The Silver State has a wealth of available talent. It is one of the reason's Nevada's Workforce ranking has surged into the top ten in 2024.Nevada is also attracting workers to move there, ranking No. 8 in this year's Lightcast Talent Attraction Index, developed exclusively for CNBC. Economic growth has slowed in 2024 but it was solid last year, helping to Nevada's Economy improve to No. 8.But Nevada's overall competitiveness has suffered during the Biden-Harris years. The state's Education system is now America's worst. At 24 students per teacher, Nevada's class sizes are the largest in the nation, according to National Education Association data. Support for higher education is meager, and there is just one public community college. K-12 test scores rank 47th in the nation.Nevada ranks No. 46 for Technology and Innovation, with relatively little presence in key emerging industries like semiconductors and artificial intelligence. The state did win a coveted Tech Hub last year under the CHIPS and Science Act, developing the next generation of lithium-ion batteries.The Tar Heel State has always been competitive, a Top States contender nearly every year -- no matter who was in the White House -- since CNBC began ranking the states in 2007. This year, North Carolina came tantalizingly close to a first-ever Top States three-peat. After notching back-to-back first place finishes in 2022 and 2023, the state slipped to second place behind Virginia in 2024 by a mere three points.While North Carolina still has America's third-best Workforce, the fourth-best Economy, and comes in second behind North Dakota for Business Friendliness, the state fell to No. 20 for Infrastructure as its electric and water utilities struggled to keep up with growth.That growth has also hurt North Carolina's Cost of Living and Cost of Doing Business rankings, and more trouble could be on the way. While the state had managed to weather the insurance crisis ravaging much of the nation this year, Hurricane Helene could change that. North Carolina was among the hardest hit by the monster storm, which caused devastating floods in western parts of the state not normally associated with hurricane damage.Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro, who took office last year and made it onto the short list for Vice President Harris' running mate in 2024, has made education -- and school funding in particular -- a central issue.\"We're facing real challenges in education and with our workforce that will hold us back in the future if we don't take action right now,\" Shapiro said in his annual budget address in February.The state has made some important strides. It now ranks third in Education, behind Virginia and Massachusetts. The state ranks ninth for higher education funding, a Shapiro priority, up from No. 34 in 2019, according to the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association.Pennsylvania is also a relatively affordable place to live. And the fact that 144 million people live within a day's drive improves the state's otherwise mediocre Infrastructure ranking.But Pennsylvania's Economy is lackluster -- ranking No. 34. Job growth is poor, and the state finishes dead last for new business formations. It probably does not help that Pennsylvania is America's twelfth-most regulated state, according to the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.Pennsylvania lags the nation in migration of college educated workers to the state, and it has just 18 community colleges in a state with 13 million people. Both statistics hurt the state's Workforce ranking.The promise by President Trump in 2018 that \"the eighth wonder of the world\" was coming to southeastern Wisconsin turned into a major embarrassment for Trump and then-Gov. Scott Walker when Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn largely abandoned its plans to build a massive facility near Racine.Walker, a Republican, promised Foxconn more than $3 billion in state and local subsidies. The failure of the deal, which was already apparent by November of 2018, may have helped cost him his re-election.His Democratic successor, Gov. Tony Evers, renegotiated the Foxconn deal. Today, Microsoft is building data centers on the site, with a fraction of the jobs that Foxconn promised. Separately, the state won a coveted Tech Hub designation under the CHIPS and Science Act, along with a $49 million grant to develop its burgeoning bio-health sector.Despite all of that, Wisconsin's overall competitiveness ranking declined this year, largely due to a big drop in its Education ranking, dropping to No. 26 from No. 9 in 2019. Evers, a former state school superintendent, has been unable to head off a big decline in state support for higher education. Wisconsin finished No. 41 in that metric this year, compared to No. 4 in 2019.",

    "title": "More Than 30M Christians Could Sit Out 2024 Presidential Election, Study Reveals",
    "content": "Upwards of 104 million people of faith -- including some 32 million self-identified Christians who regularly attend church services -- are expected to sit out of the 2024 presidential election.They are likely to hold back from the Nov. 5 contest due to a lack of interest, according to new data from Arizona Christian University's Cultural Research Center, operated by evangelical pollster George Barna.Voter enthusiasm, the study found, decreased significantly from 2020 to 2024.\"The research asked people who indicated they were not likely to vote to explain the reasons for that choice,\" wrote the researchers. \"The most common reason, offered by two-thirds of the non-voters (68%), was a lack of interest in politics and elections.\"More than half of survey respondents -- 57% -- said they dislike both leading candidates, Vice President Kamala Harris and President Donald Trump. And 55% said they don't feel either candidate reflects their values.Researchers reportedly believe that, if the survey's findings prove true on Election Day, Trump's re-election is less likely and Harris could more easily pull off a victory.Barna is encouraging pastors and ministry leaders to use their positions to urge churchgoers to practice their civic duty by casting their ballots on Nov. 5.\"Pastors often seek opportunities to have a positive influence in people's lives and upon the culture, and to help the community in which their church is located,\" he said. \"This research underscores the fact that simply encouraging people to vote in order to fulfill their biblical responsibility would not only be seen as doing their job while helping the community, but an estimated five million regular churchgoers would be likely to vote as a result of that simple exhortation.\"Last month, Dr. Jeff Myers, an author, speaker, and president of Summit Ministries, appeared on CBN's \"Faith vs. Culture,\" where he addressed the question: \"Should Christians avoid politics?\"When stepping into the ballot box, Myers urged Bible-believers to consider \"constitutional principles\" like \"life, liberty,  property,\" because those \"are the three things the Constitution said it's developed in order to provide.\"He explained, \"How do I support life with my vote? How about liberty -- things like religious liberty and free speech? What about property? Who's going to be most likely to think that people ought to have their own property and own businesses? Because there are a lot of worldviews out there, let's be honest, who say the abolition of private property would be a preferable state. So which candidate for any given office is going to be most likely to lessen the evils that occur around life, liberty, and property? ... That is going to help inform my decision.\"While there is plenty in the election cycle that can be discouraging, Myers argued the Bible calls Christians to participate in the process, noting that, in a constitutional republic like the U.S., the people are responsible for forming and holding to account their government.\"Who are the governing authorities?\" Myers asked rhetorically. \"The people. So, in this situation -- in the American context -- if you are a Christian and you are not involved, you are literally disobeying God's admonition to be obedient to the governing authorities.\"",

    "title": "Call to Action: Armed Self-Defense is the Key to Preserving All American Freedoms",
    "content": "OpinionEditors Note: This is a condensed version of Arbalest Quarrel's longer article \"NRA's Doug Hamlin Is Right: Armed Self-Defense Extends To All Other Rights,\" which you can read here.On May 20, 2024, Doug Hamlin was elected as the NRA's new Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President. His election comes at a critical time for the NRA and gun owners across America, as the stakes for the upcoming 2024 presidential election could not be higher. In his first message to NRA members, published in the July 2024 issue of America's 1st Freedom, Hamlin delivered a powerful message:\"We are resolute. We know our mission. We are all in this together . . . There has never been a more important time for us to get back on our feet than right now. The American people want their freedom. No, they demand their freedom. And now the NRA has righted its course . . . Now is the time to come together. Now is the time to be bold.\"Hamlin's words were more than just a call for unity. They were a call for action. He emphasized that the future of American freedom, and specifically the Second Amendment, depends on what gun owners do in the coming months. His message -- \"Now is the time to be bold\" -- resonated deeply with those who understand that armed self-defense is the cornerstone of preserving all other rights.In the October 2024 issue of America's 1st Freedom, Hamlin expanded on his concerns about the upcoming presidential election, making it clear that the stakes could not be higher. His remarks echoed those of countless other Second Amendment advocates who have long warned that the right to keep and bear arms is under attack like never before.Hamlin's address struck a particular chord with Stephen L. D'Andrilli, Co-Founder of The Arbalest Quarrel, who voiced his agreement in the magazine's \"Mail Call\" section. D'Andrilli echoed Hamlin's urgency, stating that if gun owners do not heed this call to action, \"all is lost, forever.\"He and his business partners at The Arbalest Quarrel recognize that the liberties hard-fought and won in 1776 have been under assault ever since, and the battle has only intensified in recent years. The forces behind the Biden-Harris administration, D'Andrilli warns, have come dangerously close to achieving their goal: transforming the U.S. into a Marxist dictatorship, ultimately merging it into a global Marxist empire.Had Donald Trump won the 2020 election, this Marxist trajectory would have been halted. But the 2020 election, fraught with unethical tactics and outright illegal strategies employed by the Democrat Party, ensured a victory for Joe Biden. Many gun owners made the fatal mistake of sitting out that election, and Hamlin and D'Andrilli agree that this must not happen again.\"We need to vote and make sure all gun owners vote,\" Hamlin said. \"If we do, we will retain our freedom.\" His message is clear: the upcoming election in November is the last chance for gun owners to turn the country around.In his July address, Hamlin described the Second Amendment as a \"keystone\" to American freedom. Without the right to armed self-defense, he warned, none of the other rights enshrined in the Constitution are secure. The Second Amendment allows Americans to defend their lives, their property, and their freedoms. Without it, every other right is in jeopardy.Hamlin's assertion strikes at the heart of the gun rights debate. While some may argue that other rights, like freedom of speech, take precedence, Hamlin rightly points out that the Second Amendment is what guarantees that those rights can be defended. Without the ability to physically defend oneself, freedom of speech and all other rights are hollow.This perspective directly challenges those who downplay the importance of the Second Amendment. Even within the NRA, voices like John C. Sigler, a Board Member, have argued that the First Amendment holds more significance. In an October 7 article in AmmoLand Shooting Sports News, Sigler claimed that the First Amendment is the bedrock upon which individual freedom is built since it makes democracy possible.However, D'Andrilli and his partners partially disagree with Sigler's assessment. While freedom of speech is crucial, it is the Second Amendment that protects all other freedoms. As D'Andrilli succinctly puts it, \"No, Mr. Sigler! You are wrong!\"The First Amendment is vital, but it does not stand alone. The right to dissent, to express one's thoughts freely, and to challenge government authority is ultimately safeguarded by the armed citizenry. Without the Second Amendment, the First Amendment and all other rights can be easily eroded by a tyrannical government. The Second Amendment is what ensures the balance of power between the people and the state.As we approach the November 2024 presidential election, the stakes could not be higher. Hamlin's message is clear: if gun owners do not turn out to vote for Donald Trump, the country will face a future in which freedom and liberty are extinguished. The forces working behind the scenes to support Kamala Harris are pushing a Marxist agenda that will destroy America's Constitutional Republic.D'Andrilli echoes Hamlin's warning, stressing that this election is the last opportunity to preserve the Republic. \"Rarely does a person get a second chance to undo a past horrible mistake,\" he says. \"We, Americans, do have that chance now.\"If Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, win the White House, the Marxist takeover of America will be complete. The Constitution will be rewritten, the Bill of Rights will be eviscerated, and the free Republic will collapse into despotism and tyranny. Gun confiscation will be at the top of their agenda, and millions of Americans who cherish their right to bear arms will find themselves disarmed and defenseless.However, there is still time to avert this disaster. As D'Andrilli points out, there are millions of gun owners across the country who have not yet registered to vote. If these gun owners register and vote in November, they can turn the tide of the election and ensure that Donald Trump returns to the White House.The battle for America's soul comes down to two opposing visions: one that embraces individualism, freedom, and the principles of the American Revolution and another that seeks to impose collectivism, control, and Marxism. Only one of these visions can prevail, and the outcome will determine the fate of the nation for generations to come.Hamlin understands this reality all too well. His call to action is both a plea and a warning. If gun owners fail to vote in 2024, the consequences will be dire. There will be no third chance to reclaim the White House in 2028. The future of America hangs in the balance, and it is up to the armed citizenry to protect it.As Hamlin states, \"Your freedom is unequivocally on the ballot.\"The NRA's mission has always been to protect and defend the Constitution, especially the Second Amendment. Since its founding in 1871, the organization has been the oldest civil rights organization in the United States, dedicated to ensuring that Americans retain their right to bear arms. Hamlin seeks to revitalize this mission and remind gun owners that their votes are crucial in preserving the Republic.Throughout history, it has been the armed citizenry that has stood as the ultimate check on government power. From the American Revolution to the present day, the right to armed self-defense has ensured that the people remain sovereign over their government.In contrast, collectivist regimes -- like the one being pushed by the Harris/Walz ticket -- have always sought to disarm the population, knowing that an armed citizenry is the greatest threat to their control. If gun owners fail to vote in 2024, they risk losing not only their firearms but also their freedom.As D'Andrilli and Hamlin emphasize, the Second Amendment is not just about protecting other rights. It is an expression of freedom itself. The armed citizen is the embodiment of liberty, a living testament to the power of the individual to resist tyranny. Without this right, all other rights are vulnerable to government overreach.Hamlin's leadership comes at a critical time for the NRA and the nation as a whole. His bold vision for the future of the organization and his unwavering commitment to defending the Second Amendment offer hope to millions of Americans who cherish their right to self-defense.But this hope can only be realized if gun owners take action. The 2024 election is the last chance to turn the country away from the path of tyranny and toward a future of freedom and liberty. As Hamlin and D'Andrilli have made clear, the time for boldness is now.Gun owners must vote or risk losing everything!In the coming days, the future of America will be decided. Will we continue down the path of collectivism and tyranny, or will we reclaim the Republic and restore our freedoms? The answer lies in the hands of gun owners across the country.Doug Hamlin's call to action is clear: vote and ensure that Donald Trump returns to the White House. Failure to do so will lead to the destruction of the Republic, the loss of the Constitution, and the end of the Second Amendment.Gun owners must rise to the challenge, register to vote, and cast their ballots in November. The future of America depends on it.About The Arbalest Quarrel:Arbalest Group created 'The Arbalest Quarrel' website for a special purpose.

    "title": "Andres Reiljan on affective polarisation: Causes, impacts and solutions",
    "content": "What is affective polarisation, and what causes it?Affective polarisation refers to the mutual dislike between different societal groups. This phenomenon is predominantly studied in a political context: For example, in the United States, many individuals express positive feelings towards the Democratic Party while disliking the Republican Party, and vice versa. In the UK, a similar divide exists between Brexiteers and Remainers, and there are many other examples worldwide. Essentially, affective polarisation is about people's feelings, and an affectively polarised society is divided into mutually hostile political groups.The causes of affective polarisation are debated, but two central approaches have emerged. The first emphasises the role of identities: individuals who strongly identify with their political party may develop a \"tribal\" instinct and - as Lilliana Mason puts it - behave like sports fans rooting for their \"home team\", leading to hostility towards the opposing \"team\". This dynamic is strengthened when social and political identities align; for example, ethnic and sexual minorities in the US predominantly favour Democrats, while white evangelicals support Republicans. The second theory perceives policy disagreements as the central driver of affective polarisation: people dislike opposing parties because they perceive their positions on critical issues (e.g. abortion rights) as wrong or harmful. This approach underlines the rational roots of affective polarisation. Empirical evidence supports both theories to some extent, and in reality, affective polarisation is likely triggered by a combination of rational and tribal elements.Media and political elites play a significant role in either exacerbating or mitigating both mechanisms of affective polarisation. While they could promote consensus, they often choose to intensify conflict for financial or political gain, further deepening societal divisions.Could you give us examples of the intrusion of party cues in everyday life? In an earlier conversation, you linked stereotyping with affective polarisation. Could you provide more insight into your research on this issue and share some of your key findings?There is, indeed, clear evidence that individuals perceive their fellow citizens through a prejudiced lens based on political preferences. For instance, voters systematically assume that supporters of opposing parties are more selfish and less intelligent.A well-known set of indicators of affective polarisation's intrusion into daily life is social distance -- the extent to which people accept supporters of disliked parties within their social circles. In the US, nearly half of Democrats and Republicans express dissatisfaction if their child were to marry a supporter of the opposing party. Recent research by myself and several other scholars indicates that similar tendencies also exist in European countries, and in some cases, people may even want to avoid being coworkers or neighbours with someone who supports a disliked party.These findings stem from public opinion surveys, raising the question of whether such attitudes also translate into actual behaviour. Evidence suggests they do: for example, discrimination based on political affiliation can occur in the job market. A good (or actually sad) example of how affective polarisation leads to real-life consequences is a story of a pro-Trump tow truck driver who left a disabled woman stranded on the highway simply because he noticed a Bernie Sanders sticker on her bumper.In summary, an affectively polarised political environment can lead to a society where members of antagonistic political camps are unwilling to date, befriend, engage in civic or economic cooperation, or even live near one another.How harmful can affective polarisation be for democracy? Can we find a \"treatment\" in a scalable and stable way?Evidence shows that higher levels of affective polarisation are associated with democratic backsliding globally. Why? If people loathe the opposing party or parties, they view them not merely as rivals, but as enemies. This mindset can lead voters to accept democratic norm violations by their own party if it helps them defeat their adversaries.However, some studies argue that the dangers posed by affective polarisation may be overstated. Others suggest that it can even increase electoral turnout. A recent study found that both very low and very high levels of affective polarisation are linked to diminished support for democratic norms, while moderately polarised feelings can enhance democratic attitudes. Thus, there might be a \"sweet spot\" where citizens are polarised enough to care about election outcomes, but not so polarised that they perceive opponents as enemies that need to be destroyed.Addressing excessive affective polarisation is possible through interventions like priming common identities, encouraging cross-partisan dialogue, and correcting misconceptions about out-groups. However, the challenge lies in implementing these strategies on a larger scale. I believe the education system is key. Incorporating the topic of polarisation into civic education classes can help individuals learn to appreciate different views and disagree respectfully with one another.Voting advice applications could serve as valuable tools in this educational framework. Our preliminary research using data from the EU&I project for the 2024 European elections suggests that informing individuals about the actual positions of various parties can reduce dislike towards political opponents.In your recent paper, 'Patterns of Affective Polarization Toward Parties and Leaders Across the Democratic World,' which won the Best CSES Scholarship award, you explore how affective polarisation manifests in different political contexts. Could you elaborate on how the findings from that study might help us better understand the current political and public debate, particularly in light to the upcoming US elections? What similarities and differences do you observe between affective polarisation in the US and Europe, based on your research?This paper provides a broad cross-national comparison and helps us better understand the structural and institutional foundations of affective polarisation across 40 countries. Comparing the US with Europe, a key difference is that Americans exhibit more polarised feelings towards leading candidates than towards their parties, whereas, in Europe, parties as organisations are more polarising than their leaders. This is largely due to the US's presidential two-party system, which largely reduces the electoral competition to just two main candidates.Although affective polarisation in the US began before Donald Trump entered the political arena in 2015, he has intensified the existing hostility. Data also confirms his polarising appeal: after the 2020 election, for instance, Democrats disliked Trump more than the Republican Party itself, while Republicans viewed Biden slightly less negatively than the Democratic Party.Looking ahead to the 2024 presidential election, much depends on Trump. Will he win or lose, and how will he and his followers behave if he loses? If he does lose and exit the political arena, it may allow for a less controversial Republican leader to emerge, potentially reducing affective polarisation. However, the current race is very close and there are many reasons to be concerned about the upcoming US election. Given the high levels of affective polarisation, accepting the loss will be very difficult for either side.",

    "title": "'Weird' and 'Surreal': How Media Outlets Covered Trump's Musical Town Hall",
    "content": "This article is part of Media Bubbles, a regular feature that looks at how different news and opinion outlets -- large, small and often partisan -- are covering the 2024 presidential election.For about 30 minutes on Monday night, former President Donald J. Trump held an impromptu musical town hall outside of Philadelphia, standing onstage and swaying to songs like \"Time To Say Goodbye\" by Sarah Brightman and Andrea Bocelli, and \"Hallelujah\" by Rufus Wainwright.Both liberal and conservative media outlets described Mr. Trump's sudden broadcast of his campaign playlist as awkward -- but through far different lenses.Mr. Trump had been answering questions from a crowd of a few hundred people with Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota at the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center in Oaks, Pa. But after multiple medical emergencies in the crowd paused the question-and-answer portion of the event, Mr. Trump said: \"Let's not do any more questions. Let's just listen to music.\"Liberal outlets described the event using words like \"weird\" and \"disastrous.\" They said that the event was evidence of cognitive decline in Mr. Trump, and that he wasn't listening to the concerns of voters. Mr. Trump and his campaign have said he does not suffer from any cognitive impairment.Conservative outlets paid far less attention to the event, though those that covered it acknowledged that the scene was bizarre. Most also emphasized that the medical emergencies in the audience had caused the detour. Some accused Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris, of unfairly mocking Mr. Trump for his choice to play music and his movements onstage.Here's how a selection of outlets on the left and the right covered the news:FROM THE LEFTThe New RepublicThe New Republic, a liberal site, described the incident in one article as a \"weird musical detour.\" In that article, Hafiz Rashid, a writer for the site, said Mr. Trump's choices on Monday were part of a larger pattern of cognitive issues. He pointed to recent events in which Mr. Trump had stumbled over his words.\"It's the latest, and strangest, example of Trump showing clear signs of mental decline, even as he insists otherwise,\" Mr. Rashid wrote.Mr. Trump has dismissed concerns about his cognitive capability and insisted that he has passed cognitive tests. Steven Cheung, Mr. Trump's campaign communications director, rejected the notion that Mr. Trump had cognitive issues in a statement, saying he \"does multiple public events every single day and the public can see he is sharper and more focused than ever before.\"In a separate article, Parker Molloy, a contributor to The New Republic, wrote that the event \"wasn't a charming detour or a moment of levity; it was a bewildering departure from the friendly campaign event.\"\"With the election just weeks away, one would expect a candidate to seize every opportunity to address voters' concerns,\" Ms. Molloy wrote. \"Instead, Trump chose to play D.J., leaving many in the crowd puzzled.\"FROM THE LEFTHuffPostHuffPost, a liberal news site, ran several headlines in all-caps that seemed to make light of the town hall. One all-caps headline said: \"What. Was. That. Joker Twists Town Hall Into Musical.\" Another said, \"Don Gets Weird: 40-minute Musical.\"Igor Bobic, a senior reporter for HuffPost who covers Congress, the White House and political campaigns, wrote in a news article that Mr. Trump had been taking questions from the audience on the issues like housing affordability, but that he \"seemed to grow bored with the format after two people fainted in the audience.\"In another article, Ed Mazza, an overnight editor at HuffPost, wrote in a news article that the event came \"amid a new focus on his health and cognition due to speeches marked by slurred words, confusion over names and location, and lengthy, rambling digressions.\"FROM THE RIGHTThe Washington ExaminerThe Washington Examiner, a right-leaning site, ran an article with the headline, \"Trump town hall takes a turn for the surreal.\"Annabella Rosciglione, a breaking news reporter for the publication, described the town hall in vivid detail, offering a chronological exposition of the evening's events.She quoted Mr. Trump calling for the event organizers to play \"Ave Maria\" while medical professionals attended to one of the sick attendees, and noted that the song played two more times that night.She referred to the event as a \"music show,\" and said Mr. Trump played nine songs, which ranged in genre from opera to disco.\"During the musical portion, Trump performed some of his signature dance moves and sometimes pointed to audience members, but he mainly swayed onstage,\" she wrote.Ms. Rosciglione also reported that, \"on his way out of the event, Trump spoke to attendees to the tune of 'Memory' from the musical Cats.\"FROM THE RIGHTRedStateWriting for RedState, a conservative blog, Nick Arama, a contributor to the site, noted that Mr. Trump answered a range of questions at the event and said that Mr. Trump \"showed more concern for his supporters than for his own safety.\"\"One of the people who fell ill even appeared to feel better as 'Ave Maria' was playing and the crowd cheered,\" Mr. Arama wrote.He also focused on Ms. Harris's reaction to Mr. Trump's town hall. After her campaign team posted on X that \"Trump appears lost, confused, and frozen onstage as multiple songs play for 30+ minutes and the crowd pours out of the venue early,\" Ms. Harris's personal account reposted it with a short message: \"Hope he's okay.\"Mr. Arama said the post showed that Ms. Harris was \"resorting to more and more desperate measures\" to mock Mr. Trump because of her \"imploding\" campaign.",

    "title": "Will Inflation Be Worse Under Trump or Harris? Here's What Economists Say",
    "content": "Dollar Scholar Asks: Is There Any Smart Financial Advice on TikTok?Although the current rate of inflation in the U.S. is roughly within normal bounds, it remains one of the greatest concerns for voters heading into the 2024 presidential election. But comparing the candidates' approaches to inflation -- both in the past and in the future -- is difficult.On one hand, the Biden-Harris administration's record is abysmal if you simply measure it based on how much prices have risen since the day the duo took office. Cumulative inflation is about 20% since January 2021. This is considered one of Vice President Kamala Harris' greatest electoral weaknesses, especially because prices really started spiking the winter President Joe Biden was inaugurated.On the other, policies have lasting effects long after a president leaves office. Many experts say former President Donald Trump's response to the pandemic -- and the stimulus spending in that era -- contributed to inflation and the economic challenges Biden has had to deal with.So, who will be better for inflation moving forward? Despite 54% of voters saying in a recent Gallup poll that they favor Trump to lead the overall economy, most economists pick Harris.In a new survey of 50 economists by the Wall Street Journal, 68% said inflation would be higher if Republican Trump's policies were to go into effect, while only 12% said it would be higher under Democrat Harris' plans. The other 20% said there would be no material difference.The Journal cited Trump's proposed tariffs as a driver of the large gap between how economists predict the candidates would handle inflation. On the campaign trail, Trump has said he would enact a 60% tariff (tax) on some Chinese goods and a tariff on foreign goods in general of at least 10%. While tariffs could help some American manufacturers, they would likely lead to higher prices for everyday consumers.In a separate panel of economists conducted by the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, 94% of respondents said they agree or strongly agree with the statement that \"imposing tariffs results in a substantial portion of the tariffs being borne by consumers of the country that enacts the tariffs, through price increases.\"Harris' inflation plans include initiatives to lower drug prices and curtail corporate \"price gouging\" that she blames for things like grocery inflation. That same panel of economists, however, generally agrees \"there is little empirical evidence that price gouging is causing high grocery prices.\"Whether inflation will be worse under Trump or Harris is ultimately for voters to decide, and their choice will likely rest on who they blame for the last bout of increased prices.Some of the questions voters are now asking -- like who, exactly, is responsible for the latest inflation crisis, and who could prevent it from happening again? -- bear similarities to age-old debates over economic responsibility in election years.A semi-recent example is the 2012 election, when former President Barack Obama took heat for his economic record and the pace of the nation's recovery from the Great Recession in his first term. But his victory could be seen as an indication that many voters recognized that he inherited a poor economy from the previous president, George W. Bush.Fast-forward to 2024, and despite many voters blaming Biden for the high prices they're facing, others seem to realize that his policies aren't the only reason they're paying $5 for eggs. The debate now is whether they'll be willing to look past the weak inflation stats from the past (almost) four years while choosing the country's next leader.Best Credit Cards of October 2024Americans Think Inflation Will Get Worse After the Election.

    "content": "The opinions expressed by contributors are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of RedState.com.Aside from not being a great candidate, one of the biggest things that doomed then-Sen. Kamala Harris' 2020 presidential run was the behind-the-scenes chaos and infighting among campaign staff at the state and national levels, where no one was on the same page, everyone was playing pass the buck, and there was no singular unifying message.As the New York Times reported in November 2019 - just a few days before Harris dropped out of the race - \"to some Harris allies, her decline is more predictable than surprising.\"\"In one instance after another, Ms. Harris and her closest advisers made flawed decisions about which states to focus on, issues to emphasize and opponents to target, all the while refusing to make difficult personnel choices to impose order on an unwieldy campaign,\" the Times also noted at the time after talking with \"50 current and former campaign staff members and allies.\"FLASHBACK: She's Free, Freefallin': Kamala Harris Places 'a Distant Fifth' in New Presidential Poll ... in CaliforniaFast forward to just a few weeks before the 2024 presidential election, and it would appear some of those same mistakes are happening all over again in the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania, where there has been a lot of external and internal grumbling along with meetings called after repeated complaints that her HQ there did not have it together:Top Democrats in Pennsylvania are worried Vice President Kamala Harris' operation is being poorly run in the nation's biggest battleground state.They say some Harris aides lack relationships with key party figures, particularly in Philadelphia and its suburbs. They complain they have been left out of events and surrogates haven't been deployed effectively. And they've urged Harris staff in private meetings to do more to turn out voters of color.For some Pennsylvania Democratic elected officials, party leaders and allies, 20 of whom POLITICO spoke to for this article, they're anxious the in-state operation has set them back.And complaints about outreach to voters of color are common in Democratic politics in Pennsylvania.But this level of frustration and finger-pointing is not.Needless to say, with roughly two and a half weeks to go before Election Day, now is not the time for campaigns in the key states, especially one as close as Pennsylvania, to scramble to hit the \"reset\" button. Then again, these issues could be seen coming from miles away:We're at a point in the election cycle where these things should be running like well-oiled machines. The fact that Harris' Pennsylvania HQ isn't at this stage is a deeply troubling sign for her campaign. Not that I'm complaining, of course, but in an ideal world for Kamala HQ, lessons would have been learned from her last embarrassing presidential run.But as we've said before, Kamala Harris was and always will be her own worst enemy. Would be something else if that inconvenient fact ultimately proved to be her campaign's undoing.",

    "title": "Former Fulton County Prosecutor Nathan Wade Says He Did 'Nothing to Compromise' Trump Case",
    "content": "A former Georgia special prosecutor who was involved in a Fulton County case against former President Donald Trump and others appeared before a House committee hearing for a deposition on Tuesday.Earlier this year, Willis and Wade became embroiled in controversy after a Trump co-defendant's attorney submitted court papers and witness testimony showing the pair were involved in a romantic relationship. The two ultimately conceded the relationship weeks later, although both denied allegations that the pair financially benefitted from the arrangement.In March, Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee, who wrote that an \"odor of mendacity\" hangs over the case, ruled that either Wade needs to step down from his position as special counsel in the case or Willis should remove herself. Wade later submitted his resignation, denying any wrongdoing.According to Wade's testimony before the panel, he said that the Trump case was \"not politically motived\" and did \"nothing to compromise the integrity\" of the case.\"My team and I investigated the issues in the election interference case for more than two years. This case was not politically motivated. Rather, it was an independent investigation based upon facts, interviews, evidence, and the rule of law. I had no mandate other than to honestly seek the truth,\" he wrote.He also disputed previous claims from Republicans that officials in the White House, the White House counsel's office, the House Jan. 6 investigative committee, or the U.S. Department of Justice were involved in the case.When asked during a break about whether Wade would invoke the Constitution's Fifth Amendment that protects individuals from self-incrimination, Wade's lawyer, former Georgia Democratic Gov. Roy Barnes, suggested that no crime was committed.\"What crime has been committed here?\" he asked.\"We gave our testimony, cooperated, and we're through,\" Barnes told reporters in the Capitol as Wade was standing near him in the hall.When asked whether he believed it was an effective meeting, Barnes responded in the affirmative. When asked why, he responded, \"We answered questions.\"Wade did not respond to any questions that reporters had asked him. No further details were provided, and Barnes would not answer questions about Willis or the case.In a letter directed to Wade in her official capacity, Willis warned him that he had confidentiality obligations in connection to the Trump case.\"It is incumbent upon you, and your counsel, to guard against the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information by invoking all applicable legal protections and privileges\" during the House deposition, Willis wrote to Wade.In her letter to the Judiciary Committee's Chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), Willis said that Wade's deposition may \"interfere with ongoing proceedings\" in the case, further suggesting that the panel should call off Wade's testimony in the matter.Willis's office has accused the former president and more than a dozen other individuals of trying to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia as well as racketeering charges.Trump and most of the co-defendants in the case have pleaded not guilty, although several people who were initially charged came to a plea agreement with prosecutors, pleading guilty in exchange for lighter penalties. The former president, who faces separate charges in other jurisdictions, has said the cases are politically motivated attempts to sway the 2024 presidential election.A court filing submitted by Willis's office over the summer attempted to have the appeals court dismiss the disqualification bid because there was not enough evidence.The Epoch Times contacted the Fulton County District Attorney's office and Wade's attorneys for comment but received no reply by publication time.",

    "content": "Supporters cheers as US Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris arrives to speak at a campaign event at the Erie Insurance Arena in Erie, Pennsylvania, on October 14, 2024.Five of the seven swing states in the 2024 presidential election improved their overall business climates during the Biden-Harris administration, according to CNBC's annual America's Top States for Business study. But that does not necessarily mean the states are better off economically, in an election cycle where the economy has consistently ranked at or near the top of voters' concerns.Since 2007, CNBC has been ranking all 50 states across ten categories of competitiveness to determine the best overall states in which to do business. Behind the rankings are dozens of metrics that offer a detailed picture of each state's business and economic climate.We compared the most recent rankings, published in July, with those from 2019 -- the last full year of data before the Covid-19 pandemic, and in many ways the peak of the Trump economy. Of the seven biggest battlegrounds in terms of polling and Electoral College heft, only Nevada and Wisconsin saw their overall rankings decline.The other 5 swing states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania -- all improved their standing.Of course, competitiveness is complicated. It often has every bit as much, or more, to do with state policies than what is happening in Washington. Still, there are plenty of statistics for both the Trump and Harris campaigns to either claim credit for, or to run away from.Here is how the business climates break down in the battlegrounds.",

    "title": "Presidents of the United States: John Tyler, a man and president of many firsts",
    "content": "Editor's Note: This profile is part of a series taking a closer look at US presidents ahead of the 2024 presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.John Tyler was a man of many firsts.He was the first Vice President to be elevated to the top job after the death of his predecessor. Critics thus dubbed him 'His Accidency.'At 51, he was at the time the youngest man to serve as president.He was also the first president whose wife died while in office - and was the first president to marry while in office. Tyler also served as a representative of the Confederacy.Let's take a closer look at the 10th President of the United States.Early lifeTyler was born on March 29, 1790, in Virginia's Charles City county into a wealthy planter family. His parents were John Tyler and Mary Armistead.John was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates during the American Revolution. He later served as Governor of Virginia. Tyler was raised on the family plantation in Greenway. He was taught to be a strict constitutionalist - to adhere to the document as written above all things.He attended the College of William & Mary - after which he began an apprenticeship with his father and ex-United States Attorney General Edmund Randolph in preparation for a career in the law. In 1809, Tyler was admitted to the bar.In 1813, he married Letitia Christian and bought a patch of land nearby and constructed his own plantation.PoliticsLike his father, Tyler began his career in the Virginia legislature. Tyler on multiple terms in the legislature, served as a United States representative, Virginia Governor and US Senator.Throughout his career, he showed consistent support for states' rights. Tyler also opposed the Missouri Compromise.Though he was a Democrat, Tyler would oppose some policies of then-president Andrew Jackson (1829-1837) - whom critics had dubbed a 'tyrant' and 'King Andrew.'In 1840, the Opposition Whig Party nominated Tyler as Benjamin Harrison's vice president. Their hope was to attract the support of those who backed states' rights in the South and despised what was called Jacksonian Democracy.Harrison and Tyler, known as \"Tippecanoe and Tyler Too,\" defeated the Democratic incumbents Martin Van Buren and Richard M Johnson.Time in officeOn April 4, 1841, Harrison passed away. It had been just a month since the inauguration. Tyler now became the first vice president to take the Oval Office after the death of the president.At the time, a debate broke out over exactly how much power Tyler would hold. Tyler, though, was in no doubt. He quickly assumed the full powers of the presidency and moved into the White House.Though the Whigs were not unduly unhappy, they would soon find themselves in a face-off with the man who was leading the country. Nearly the entire Cabinet resigned after Tyler vetoed two bills that aimed to reestablish a national bank.The Whigs then threw Tyler out of the party. By now, Tyler had also alienated his friends in the Democratic Party. He was president, but he was also a man without a party.A year later, the first impeachment resolution ever against a president was introduced in the House of Representatives.Despite the issues with the Congressional Whigs, Tyler's administration actually achieved some of its goals. These included passing the Log Cabin Bill, establishing the United States Weather Bureau, ending the Second Seminole war and the rebellion against the Rhode Island government.Tyler would also sign legislation to annex Texas before leaving office - arguably the biggest accomplishment of his presidency.By then, Tyler's wife Christian had passed away - making her the first president's wife to die while he served in office. Tyler then married Julia Gardiner - becoming the first president to marry while in office.Tyler in 1844 entered the race for president but found few takers for his candidacy. He ultimately threw his support behind James K Polk. In 1845, Tyler left the White House.When states began seceding in 1861 before Abraham Lincoln's inauguration, Tyler tried in vain to stop them. When he failed, he returned to Virginia and began working to establish the Confederacy. Tyler was elected to the Confederate House of Representatives shortly before his death in 1862.He was given a full state funeral by his 'countrymen.'LegacyThough Tyler was not a massively successful president, he did tread new ground. His stepping into the top job and assuming all the powers of the presidency set an example that is followed to this day.It also showed that the line of succession and the orderly transfer of power worked. In short, the system held.",

    "title": "24% of Americans say the winner of the 2024 Presidential election helps determine whether 'I'm rich'",
    "content": "(BPT) - Beyond the U.S. economy, one in two Americans believe the outcome of the 2024 Presidential election will directly impact their own personal finances, according to new research from Empower, a leader in financial planning, investing, and advice. In fact, a quarter (24%) say that the winner of the election helps determine \"whether I'm rich or not\" -- a belief more firmly held by the Middle Class -- reaching 27% for those with an income $50k-$100k, compared to 22% for those making under $50k; and 23% for people with incomes greater than $100k.Americans can count the ways they're invested in this year's election, with 42% saying the amount of money they have will be tangibly more or less depending on who wins. One third (33%) say their \"Wallet Power\" -- or their overall ability to spend, save, and invest -- will either shrink (33%) or increase (31%). More than a third (34%) believe the Presidential election is a major predictor of their retirement timeline and financial security, with 30% saying the winner will impact those plans, causing them to work longer, or have a shorter retirement (40% Gen Z, 39% Millennials).\"The adage is that 'all politics is local' -- and when it comes to money, it hits very close to home, with many Americans seeing a direct link between their own prosperity and the highest office in the land,\" says Rebecca Rickert, head of communications at Empower. \"From their retirement timeline to their account balances, people feel there is a lot riding on the outcome of the election in terms of their own financial happiness.\"Chief among the issues at stake, many Americans (42%) believe the winner of the Presidential election will get inflation and prices under control, making things more affordable (47% men, 38% women) at a time when many Americans say they're feeling \"The Big Shrink.\" One third (33%) say the winner of the Presidential election will make it easier to reach their personal financial goals, such as the 33% who say the victor will make it more affordable to buy a home (42% Millennials).The money moves on the ballotPeople say they'll make concrete money moves based on who wins: 41% will add more money to their emergency savings, save more cash (41% overall, 48% Millennials), and be more frugal with their spending (45%).More Americans say they are closely following the 2024 Presidential race than the stock market (67% vs. 33%), and half (53%) agree that uncertainty about the outcome of the Presidential election impacts the markets. One in four (23%) will invest more in the stock market based on the outcome of the Presidential election (32% Millennials) or change their asset allocation (34% Millennials). Nearly 1 in 5 (18%) plan to take more drastic measures, and say they will withdraw their money/liquidate their investments (27% Millennials).More findings:Empower's \"The Ticket: Money and Politics\" study is based on online survey responses from 2,200 Americans ages 18+ fielded by Morning Consult between July 22-24, 2024.

    "title": "Trump vows to 'end all sanctuary cities,' restore 'normalcy' at 'Faulkner Focus' town hall with female voters",
    "content": "'The Faulkner Focus' host Harris Faulkner previews her exclusive town hall with former President Trump, airing Wednesday.Former President Donald Trump vowed to end sanctuary cities and restore \"normalcy\" as he took questions from female voters concerned about a variety of issues ahead of Election Day, including the economy, crime and abortion.One woman, whose son attends the University of Georgia, pressed him on the issue of crime and public safety following the murder of nursing student Laken Riley earlier this year during the exclusive town hall Wednesday on \"The Faulkner Focus.\"TRUMP TAKES DETOUR TO ULTRA-BLUE CALIFORNIA TO SPOTLIGHT HARRIS' HOME TURF'S FAILED POLICIES: 'PARADISE LOST'\"My son is a Georgia Bulldog. He was on campus the day Laken Riley was murdered,\" the attendee told the former president. \"Terrifying for all those kids, right? I wanted to know... how quickly in a sanctuary city - like they're calling Athens, Georgia - how quickly can you remove those threats to our societies that our children can go out on a run as they rightfully should be able to do in a park in the daytime by themselves?\"\"We can do things in terms of moving people out. We can move them out of the sanctuary cities. We're going to end all sanctuary cities in the United States, and we're going to go back to normalcy,\" he pledged in response.\"And we're going to have law and order.\"Crime consistently ranks as a top issue for Republican voters nationwide, falling right behind the economy, which polls indicate is the largest motivator as constituents head to the ballot box.Recent polling showed former President Trump has a nine-point lead over Vice President Kamala Harris when it comes to handling the economy, the single most important issue for voters going into the 2024 presidential election.The Gallup poll found that 54% of Americans say Trump is more capable of handling the economy, compared to 45% for Harris. The economy ranked as the most important issue for Republicans and for all Americans, but it didn't rate in the top five for Democrats.One woman asked him about the rising cost of living for families and his plans for the child tax credit.\"I'm a single mom to two kids here, and just in three and a half years, my child tax credit has decreased by 80%,\" one attendee told Trump. \"Last year, I had broken my neck, and I tried applying for any kind of assistance and was denied because I did not make less than $700 a month... what kind of realistic changes that do you think you can provide  single parents, married parents, any kind of parent to just simply afford children in today's world, with the way things are here?\"\"I gave you the largest tax cuts in the history of our country,\" Trump said in response. \"Larger than the Reagan cuts. Larger. I understand exactly what you're saying. We're going to readjust things so that it's fair to everybody, because it's really not fair to everybody... We're going up higher, but we're also going to readjust because you have to make some readjustments.\"CHECK OUT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS IN THE 2024 ELECTION\"It's unfair to some people, and we're not going to have that,\" he continued.Another town hall attendee, Pamela, originally from California, asked the former president about abortion, a topic that ranks among the most important for some women as they head to the ballot box.\"Women are entitled to do what they want to and need to do with their bodies, including their unborn. That's on them regardless of the circumstance. Some are necessary to save their own lives,\" she said. \"Why is the government involved in women's basic rights?\"\"For 52 years, this issue has torn our country apart,\" Trump responded. \"Every legal scholar, the great ones, every lawyer - but the Democrats, the Republicans, the liberals, and conservatives, they wanted it brought out of the federal government and brought back to the states for a vote of the people. And like Ronald Reagan, I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest, life of the mother.\"\"I strongly believe... you have to follow your heart. Some people don't. It's a very small percentage, but you have to follow your heart,\" he continued. \"But you have the exceptions. But what we were able to do was through the courage of six Supreme Court justices. We were able to do this after years and years of turmoil.\"Abortion has ranked as a top issue for Democrats heading into Election Day, alongside democracy, education and health care.Trump also holds leads over Harris on immigration (54%-45%) and foreign affairs (52%-47%). Harris holds her own leads on the top issues for Democrats, however, including health care (54%-44%), abortion (56%-40%) and climate change (61%-35%).",

    "content": "Elon Musk is hitting the campaign trail in Pennsylvania this week as the 2024 presidential election nears.\"Tomorrow night through Monday, I will be giving a series of talks throughout Pennsylvania. If you'd like to attend one of my talks, there's no attendance fee. You just need to have signed our petition supporting free speech & right to bear arms & have voted in this election,\" Musk explained.\"To clarify, you need have voted in Pennsylvania,\" he added.Elon Musk said he will give \"a series of talks from tomorrow night through Monday\" in Pennsylvania, less than two weeks after the billionaire made a high-profile appearance with former president and Republican candidate Donald Trump there.Earlier last week, a source told Reuters that Musk plans more campaigning for Trump in Pennsylvania and his appearances would be connected to his America PAC political action committee.Pennsylvania is considered a crucial state for both Trump and his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, in the race for the Nov. 5 election.Musk's \"series of talks\" in the critical swing state follows his appearance on stage with President Trump at the historic Butler rally.Musk stated that one of the requirements for attending one of his talks was signing his pro-Trump Super PAC's petition supporting free speech and the right to bear arms.The petition from America PAC offers registered voters $47 for every registered voter in critical swing states they refer.\"The First and Second Amendments guarantee freedom of speech and the right to bear arms. By signing below, I am pledging my support for the First and Second Amendments,\" the petition reads.\"In appreciation for your support, you will receive $47 for each registered voter you refer that signs this petition,\" it continues.\"Our goal is to get 1 million registered voters in swing states to sign in support of the Constitution, especially freedom of speech and the right to bear arms. This program is exclusively open to registered voters in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina. Expires October 21,\" it adds.\"For every person you refer who is a swing state voter, you get $47! Easy money,\" Musk said.",

    "content": "Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris will give her first formal interview with Fox News on Wednesday. Below, find out what time the interview will start and get more details about the special broadcast.On Tuesday, October 15, Fox News announced that Vice President Harris will sit down with the chief political anchor, Bret Baier, for her first formal interview in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.The interview comes after Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, appeared on \"Fox News Sunday\" for the second consecutive week on Sunday. The Democratic ticket has ramped up its media appearances as the 2024 presidential election approaches in just a few weeks.Last week, Harris was interviewed by \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker and appeared on ABC's \"The View,\" \"The Howard Stern Show,\" the \"Call Her Daddy\" podcast, and Stephen Colbert's \"The Late Show.\"In response, former President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday that Harris \"has wisely chosen\" Baier to interview her because he is \"considered to be 'Fair & Balanced,' though often very soft to those on the 'cocktail circuit' Left.\" In a separate post, Trump argued that the news network \"has totally lost its way\" and claimed Harris' spokesperson, Ian Sams, \"virtually owns .\"Trump will appear on Fox News the same day as Harris' interview in a pre-taped town hall-style event that will focus \"on issues impacting women ahead of the election,\" including the \"economy, abortion, immigration, and health care,\" according to a Fox News press release.Kamala Harris' first formal interview with Fox News will start at 6 p.m. ET on Wednesday, Oct. 16.Fox News Channel's chief political anchor, Bret Baier, will interview Kamala Harris on Wednesday night during the Special Report with Bret Baier.Baier has moderated Republican presidential primary debates and town halls with candidates across the political spectrum.

    "title": "50-50 elections are bad for America",
    "content": "The 2024 presidential election is tied. Again. As I write this, Nate Silver's forecast is literally 50-50. And that's bad news for America.I'm not just saying this because it defies logic that a man who was twice impeached, convicted of 34 felony counts and found liable for sexual assault (just to mention three of Donald Trump's greatest hits) is a whisker away from winning the presidency. Nor am I saying this because the tight polls are causing Democrats to feel increasingly apoplectic -- a situation that surely isn't good for their mental health.I'm saying this because the last thing we need is another super-close election. It doesn't strain credulity to imagine that a close race could lead to a disputed outcome, which could then lead to violence.If that prospect isn't dicey enough, consider the possibility of a literal tie in the electoral college of 269-269. The winner would be determined based on which party controls the most state delegations in the House of Representatives, meaning that Trump would very likely emerge victorious.It's hard to imagine the toll that process might take on our nation.It is in everyone's best interest for the winner -- whoever that turns out to be -- to receive a decisive victory. But even if you rule out the nightmare scenarios that could be triggered by a close election, our 50-50 nation is symptomatic of a larger problem.With a few exceptions (such as Barack Obama's 2008 victory), we have been a divided nation for about a quarter of a century.We kicked off the 2000s with the Bush v. Gore recount in Florida, which left many Americans feeling disaffected. Next, in 2004 -- the only time a Republican has won the popular vote since 1988 -- the election came down to Ohio (leading some on the left to advance a vote fraud conspiracy theory).George W. Bush won a popular vote majority in 2004 by turning out the Republican base, on the theory that there weren't that many persuadable voters worth persuading. It was a shrewd, if fateful, strategy.The 2012 election might have ended decisively, but it was like watching a football game that felt close until the very end. Even Mitt Romney didn't see the end coming.In 2016, Trump won the presidency by virtue of just 77,744 votes in three states (while losing the popular vote by almost 3 million). And in 2020, Joe Biden won by virtue of a mere 42,844 votes in three states.The days when Ronald Reagan could win a 49-state landslide, and come away with at least something resembling a mandate, are long gone.Nowadays, nearly half the country feels perpetually disenfranchised.A confluence of factors have given us a nation where at least 45 percent of voters on each side are unshakably locked into their respective parties, no matter what happens (as Trump has boasted, he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not lose any voters; he was clearly correct).How did we get to be so tribal? Political and geographic sorting have conspired to insulate us from making friends with whom we disagree.The rise of partisan animosity since the 1990s has reduced our willingness to compromise (why would you compromise with evil?) -- and has undermined our openness to persuasion or even ticket splitting.And innovations such as talk radio, cable news, podcasts, YouTube and social media have allowed us to hide in our echo chambers, hardening our tribal identities -- while simultaneously radicalizing us by exposing us to some of the worst and most extreme voices from the other side.Now, you might think that an evenly divided nation is all well and good -- that perpetual close competition forces the parties to compete for our votes. But in a two-party system designed for consensus, the opposite is true. The party out of power can assume that they will win the next time, so why bother to improve or change, much less compromise with the party in power? Look no further than Trump's decision to kill the border bill for evidence.Conversely, upon winning office, newly elected leaders assume their tenure is fleeting. So they follow a \"go big or go home\" legislative strategy (see the mistakes Joe Biden made early on in his administration, when he postured as the next FDR or LBJ) -- an ambitious conceit that often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.Watching this race end in what looks to be a virtual tie makes me worry that it's Groundhog Day once again. While the outcome of the 2024 presidential race is hard to predict, it's a safe bet that it's going to be close -- and this alone makes the coming weeks and months very dangerous.A close outcome makes it easier for someone to claim the election was stolen. A close outcome makes it more likely there will be political violence. And a close election continues the vicious cycle that we have been stuck in for decades.Breaking this spell will require one party to eventually emerge as dominant. It's tighter than a tick, and that's a problem.",

    "title": "Virginia attorney general questions timing of DOJ voter lawsuit - Washington Examiner",
    "content": "Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares rebuffed the Department of Justice's new lawsuit against Virginia as Republicans spotlight the department's legal action against the state.The lawsuit, announced by the DOJ last week, was filed after Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) issued an executive order that removed over 6,300 noncitizens from the state's voter registration rolls in August. Miyares contended that the DOJ is lacking \"basic common sense\" with its legal action, noting how Youngkin used a law signed by Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), then governor of Virginia, back in 2006.\"My question is, where are all these left-wing groups that have brought this lawsuit when Tim Kaine signed this into law or when Ralph Northam or Terry McAuliffe were also similarly acting in a similar capacity?\" Miyares said on Fox News's Fox and Friends First. \"So I applaud Gov. Youngkin for wanting to make sure we have clean voting rolls. That's common sense, but as we all know, common sense isn't very common in D.C. these days.\"Miyares added that the DOJ's assessment that citizens were removed from the state's voter rolls is incorrect as noncitizens at the DMV confirm they are noncitizens. He also questioned why the DOJ is using its time and resources to fight the governor's action less than a month before the election, calling it \"misplaced priorities.\"During his appearance, Miyares recalled how his mother voted for the first time in her late 30s after fleeing Cuba, saying a person's right to vote is \"precious.\" However, Miyares reiterated that Youngkin's legal action does not target citizens and their right to vote and said he is \"looking forward\" to defending the governor's action.Miyares's appearance comes as Youngkin has also been spotlighting the DOJ's lawsuit against Virginia, appearing on both Fox News and CNN on Monday evening to discuss it. On CNN, the governor questioned why the lawsuit was filed just 25 days before the election, noting that the lawsuit appears \"far more political\" now than if it had been filed earlier.\n\"Why is it that anyone could argue that a process that removes noncitizens off of our voter rolls is anything else other than common sense and constitutional?\" Youngkin asked network anchor Jake Tapper.Virginia governors are limited to serving two nonconsecutive terms, meaning Youngkin will not be eligible to seek reelection next year. While Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, a Republican, announced her candidacy for the 2025 gubernatorial race last month, Miyares has said Republicans need to focus on the 2024 presidential election \"before even thinking about next year.\"",

    "title": "Has Kanye West been cloned? Inside the theory the rapper 'isn't the same person'",
    "content": "Reality star Kristin Cavallari just mainstreamed the niche internet theory by discussing it on her Let's Be Honest podcast, claiming she wholeheartedly 'believes it.'The 37-year-old referred to an online discussion topic that has faded in and out of obscurity over the past several years.The theory posits that rapper Kanye West, 47, has been replaced by a clone who looks almost identical to him and is living his life in his place.The 'evidence' to support the claim includes the assertion that Kanye's physical appearance has drastically changed in recent years, with his face supposedly changing shape and his height increasing by several inches.Purveyors of the idea also claim that nefarious - possibly government or Illuminati - forces were responsible for the shift, with their motivation being that Kanye was 'speaking too much truth.'The TV star claimed on her podcast that Kanye has said 'too much' in recent years, and therefore the version that is presenting himself to the world right now isn't actually him.She continued: 'I think there are clones, and I think Kanye is a clone. Remember when he was talking a lot? He was really saying too much and the cabal didn't like that.'The word 'cabal' - which means a secret political clique or faction - has become a buzzword among American far-right conspiracy theorists in recent years. It's usually used to refer to an ambiguous, usually left-wing, usually Jewish, group of powerful forces bent on keeping 'the truth' (another ambiguity) from being found out by the average citizen.When QAnon supporters discuss the fantasy that President Joe Biden stole the 2020 election, they often blame 'the cabal' for the subterfuge.The same term comes up among those who, more recently, have become convinced with zero evidence that federal responders are diverting disaster relief money to house undocumented migrants in the wake of Hurricane Milton, which devastated a large swatch of the South Eastern United States earlier this month.It seems that if you want to blame somebody for something, 'the cabal' is a reliable catch-all among conspiracy-minded right-wingers who are falling victim to misinformation more and more often in the lead-up to the 2024 US presidential election.Cavallari continued: 'He  said, \"If I go away and I come back and I look different, that is not me.\" And what the f*** happened? He was gone. Remember when he fell off the face of the earth?'Compare old photos of him. It's not the same f****** person!'She also insisted that Britney Spears has been replaced by a clone, to which guest co-host Justin Anderson argued that he had worked with Britney's sister Jamie Lynn on multiple occasions, but the Laguna Beach star refused to back down.She said: 'I believe this with every ounce of my body but people who are going to come out and say something get killed.'Cavallari initially posted a TikTok of her espousing the theory but later deleted it from her account, but that hasn't stopped the idea from spreading with increased gusto. Cavallari has 4.9million followers on Instagram alone.The theory first began circulating several years ago thanks to an interview clip in which Kanye said: 'If I ever go anywhere you'll know why.'The video is often misquoted, with many people (including Cavallari) remembering the quote as: 'If I ever disappear and come back, it's not me.'While some people spreading the theory online seem to only be looking to cause controversy or 'rage bait' to get engagement, a quick scroll through Reddit or X makes it all too evident that many people seem to buy into the idea.X user @CarolinaIsabelF wrote: 'Honestly, I kind of agree with Kristin on this one -- Kanye has been acting super weird lately. Whether it's the clone theory or not, something definitely feels off. It wouldn't be the first time strange things happen in Hollywood, and when people start exposing secrets, you never know how far the powers-that-be will go to keep things quiet. It's definitely got me thinking!'@Sweetemmilyn posted: 'Lol. Does make you think. Kanye totally reversed course after his forced lockdown. No longer freedom loving talk. Went back to creepy and angry, dating a sexpot, and doesn't care about her being modest like he did with Kim. So I have to lean toward the possibility she's right though.'@DavidLCorbo posted a recent photo of the rapper with the caption: 'This is NOT Kanye. This is a clone. The man recently called himself the new Jesus and I said to myself \"that's it, we've lost him.\" But I can't ignore what my eyes are seeing. This ain't him. Fight me.'Cavallari also posted the clip on her Instagram and the comments are...startling.@ginalolla wrote: 'The fact that people (like your cohost) think there's absolutely no way this could happen, is astonishing to me. I think everyone just doesn't want to believe how much control some people have in this world.'@hbsellsohaz agreed, writing: 'Girl you are awake.'@stephanieannfenton posted: 'Yesssssss Kristin!!!! Love you more!!! 🙌🙌 it's not freaking Kanye!!! Look at Diddy too. His eyes are so close together now and it doesn't even look like him.'There are also those online who are quick to laugh at the theory, with one Reddit user writing: 'Ye clone theory is ridiculous and nobody ever gives a reason as to why he would be cloned.'Any difference in Kanye's appearance can most reasonably be chalked up to the simple passage of time, something that seems lost on posters sharing side-by-side photos of Kanye from 2006 and 2024 and going on about how different he looks after 20 years of aging.Many also reference a photo in which Kanye is obviously wearing shoulder pads, claiming the difference in his shoulders proves he's a copy of the original rapper.As for the erraticness of his opinions and social media outbursts, the story is likely much simpler and sadder than a government clone.The rapper, who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, has been displaying increasingly erratic behaviour in recent years, clearly suffering from the symptoms of the mental health disorder.But logic is obviously not at the forefront of the 'Kanye is a clone' movement. Instead, the theory is likely rooted in thinly veiled anti-semitism.The Gold Digger rapper sparked controversy for antisemitic remarks in 2023, resulting in his being banned from Twitter and Instagram for violating the rules of the social media platforms.He later apologised for the comments and hasn't spoken on the topic since - which Kanye clone-conspiracy-theorists think proves he was replaced by a pawn beholden to powerful forces who don't want him revealing dangerous 'truths.'Many posts about the theory refer to these remarks when discussing the 'truths' Kanye was supposedly telling.One Redditor not-so-subtly posted: 'He got taken out for speaking the truth, that's a clone. We all know who ended him, it's the certain group of people he criticised in his tweets...'It's worth noting Cavallari may be unaware of the antisemitic and right-wing undertones of the Kanye clone theory and just thinks the rapper has looked different recently.But the seemingly harmless conspiracy is part of a larger, more complex web of misinformation that has infected right-wing American politics to a dangerous degree - and Cavallari's endorsement is further proof that these ideas are finding their way into the mainstream.If you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we'd love to hear from you.MORE : Trump claims Harris has 'dangerous' health problems - like seasonal allergiesMORE : Bianca Censori was Kanye West's 'orgy coordinator' according to shocking new claims",

She announced this year that she will vote for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.In a statement, the Committee on House Administration's Subcommittee on Oversight said that its Republican chairman, Barry Loudermilk, \"obtained never-before-seen correspondence between January 6 Select Committee Vice-Chair Liz Cheney and Cassidy Hutchinson and in 2022, while Hutchinson was still a subject of the Select Committee's investigation.\"The statement added: \"In the months prior to Hutchinson's explosive private and public testimony, Cheney communicated with Hutchinson, both directly and through an intermediary -- Alyssa Farah Griffin -- while Hutchinson was represented by her attorney, Stefan Passantino.\"Newsweek sought email comment from Cheney and Griffin on Wednesday.It is clear from the communication that Griffin told Hutchinson that Cheney wanted \"a follow up with you, with your lawyer that she and  Dan George can lead.\" This suggests that both Cheney and Griffin wanted to ensure that Hutchinson had legal representation at the meetings. The January 6 committee conducted six interviews of Hutchinson in total.\"Farah Griffin and Hutchinson knew each other from their time working together in the White House. Farah Griffin was one of the first former Trump administration officials to publicly criticize Trump in January 2021, and was publicly working with the Select Committee on its investigation,\" the oversight committee's statement reads.Hutchinson and Griffin met in Washington, and the former told the latter that she had new information to give the January 6 committee.\"Her new testimony would include her never-before-heard story that alleged that President Trump agreed with rioters chanting 'Hang Mike Pence,'\" the statement reads.\n\"However, it appears that Cheney knew communicating with Hutchinson while Hutchinson was represented by an attorney and a subject of the Select Committee's investigation, without going through Hutchinson's attorney, would be unethical\" the statement continues.\"This is evident by Farah Griffin's text to Hutchinson that Cheney's 'one concern was so long as  you have counsel, she can't really ethically talk to you without him,'\" the oversight committee's statement adds.",

    "title": "Who Will Win the 2024 Election, Trump or Harris? Newsweek Readers' Verdicts",
    "content": "With only 20 days left before Election Day, when voters will have their final say on who they want to be the next president of the United States, both candidates appear locked in a dead heat as they race toward the White House.However, aside from Arizona and Georgia, where Trump leads by 1.6 and 1.1 points, respectively, 538's polling aggregates show the candidates separated by less than a point in the remainder of the battlegrounds. With margins so narrow, just a few thousand votes could determine the outcome in this year's crucial swing states, and the election as a whole.In an online poll, we asked: 'Who will win the 2024 election?' Over a thousand readers took part, with Harris achieving a slight lead over her rival. Newsweek readers from both camps also wrote in to share their predictions - and thoughts - on who will be crowned victorious in the 2024 presidential election. Here is a selection of those comments, lightly edited for clarity. The results of the poll are at the end of this article.Donald TrumpIn my opinion, his experience by far outshines that of Harris. Trump's intuition is right on target and he cares for the country. He's capable of dealing with the global political master-minds, whereas Harris's capability here is doubtful. In my opinion, his actual opinion re. Ukraine is more favorable towards the E.U. stance than seems apparent. And the \"proof in the pudding\" is that with him we had no wars and small businesses were not hampered by the many restrictions Democrats, who wish to control everything and everyone, place on them. That's my story and I'm sticking with it - An Independent voter. Maija CollinsKamala HarrisDonald is not competent. He has no ideas. His concepts are from the Heritage Foundation. He is a puppet, and Heritage is running the show. He is emulating Orban. He is a copycat politician. He cannot think on his own. He is too old, and he is divisive. He is also very disrespectful toward woman and those who do not agree with. Why is he a candidate? A convicted felon and sexual assaulter. This is a disgrace. Taylor ThompsonDonald TrumpI am sad to say but I think Trump is going to win. He has a very dedicated fan base and viewed from over here in the UK it looks as if the GOP and Trump himself have done a good job in stacking the electoral system towards themselves. He is of course a very divisive figure so those states which are Republican and those that a Democrat are more firm in their standing.

Enter, Florida man, or men, as it were.An antisemitism advocacy group called @StopAntisemitism replied to the post and outed one of the men on the boat as a loud and proud Neo-Nazi Jon Minadeo II of the Goyim Defense League, a hate group as designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Newsweek noted that Minadeo was once arrested in Poland outside of the Auschwitz death camp for spreading extremist propaganda. Sounds like this lil' boat stunt is right up his alley.The Trump campaign has responded to the controversy and in true manipulative MAGA fashion, have spun the incident into a grand conspiracy. Says campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt to Newsweek:\"Kamala's supporters are reaching all-time lows. Social media posts show that genuine Trump supporters identified these idiots as liberal activists trying to create fake news. They clearly responded accordingly.\"The \"genuine Trump supporters\" that Leavitt is referencing are in the above video.

    "title": "Kamala Harris Unveils Crypto Policies with a Focus on Black Investors",
    "content": "Critics question whether Harris's policies will genuinely help Black Americans or create additional barriers in the crypto landscape.Kamala Harris, a prominent candidate for the 2024 presidential election, has announced her first specific crypto policy. According to a tweet by TodayCryptoRj, Harris plans to support a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency and other digital assets aimed at protecting Black men who invest in these assets. The move has sparked debate, with some criticizing it as race-based favoritism, while others see potential for bipartisan collaboration.This policy is a change in Harris's stance, especially since her campaign was initially viewed as anti-crypto. The co-chair of the Harris campaign, Cedric Richmond, explained that this announcement is a component of the larger \"Opportunity Economy\" promise made by Harris.With the help of this effort, Black males will have access to chances for wealth-building, entrepreneurship, and homeownership, among other tools necessary for them to succeed in the market. However, concerns remain about whether these policies will make it easier or harder for Black Americans to participate in the crypto industry, particularly with Bitcoin.Anybody, regardless of race, color, or creed, has equal access to Bitcoin because it is an open-source protocol. Many members of the Bitcoin community feel that Harris's policy focusing on race is not enough because Bitcoin promotes diversity by default. Critics argue that the policy appears to pander to specific voter demographics rather than address the broader need for innovation in the industry.Moreover, comparing Harris's approach to that of former President Donald Trump, some argue that Trump's policies offer more inclusive benefits for the entire crypto community. His pro-Bitcoin stance is seen as fostering innovation for all Americans without favoring any particular demographic.Additionally, there is growing skepticism within the crypto community regarding Harris's so-called \"crypto pivot.\" While some, including Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, have backed Harris, others remain unconvinced. The key question is whether her policies will genuinely benefit all Bitcoiners or create more hurdles for Black investors.",

    "title": "US presidential elections: Allan Lichtman's 'Nostradamus' prophecies",
    "content": "With the US presidential election in just a few weeks, several pollsters are busy conducting opinion polls and analysing them. Political polls, however, are not necessarily reliable indicators of election results, especially in a close contest.On the other hand, Allan Lichtman, a history professor at American University in Washington, DC, has made a straightforward yet almost Nostradamus-like prediction about the US presidential elections that has, thus far, had a 90% accuracy rate.Well, how many pollsters can boast such a coveted prediction record? Using an unconventional approach he and his geophysicist friend Vladimir Keilis-Borok developed in 1981, Lichtman disregarded opinion polls and pundits in favour of examining the fundamental issues that, according to them, have shaped every presidential election since 1860.Since 1984, his prediction system, \"The Keys to the White House,\" has been evaluating the strength and performance of the incumbent party and predicting the outcomes of US presidential elections using 13 historical factors, or \"keys\" (four political, seven performance, and two personality).The Gore missHe has been right in all except one of his predictions, which was George W. Bush's contested triumph against Al Gore in 2000. Lichtman, however, contends that even that stain is unfair, pointing out that thousands of votes that were disallowed came from people who had honestly attempted to support Gore but unintentionally spoilt their ballots. Thirteen broad, true-false questions that gauge the effectiveness of the White House party are the keys.The party mandate, White House scandal, incumbency, primary contest, third party, shortand long-term economies, policy changes, incumbent and challenger charisma, foreign policy success and failure, and social unrest are the keys. Lichtman's model predicts that the incumbent party's candidate will lose if six or more keys are against them.And, in early September, Lichtman predicted Kamala Harris would win the 2024 presidential election this time around; eight of the 13 keys supported her. Lichtman argues that the Democrats gained House seats even though they lost seats, so the midterm gains key is false for Harris. The incumbent key is also false because Biden withdrew from the contest.It is to be noted that Lichtman had previously angrily objected to replacing Biden as the Democratic nominee following his appalling performance in the June debate and rejected the veracity of opinion polls suggesting that Biden's chances of winning had been harmed.Harris's chancesAccording to Lichtman, Harris benefitted from the lack of a formidable third party due to the withdrawal of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s independent campaign, favourable short- and long-term economic indicators, significant legislative accomplishments carried out by the Biden administration, and the absence of social unrest or scandal surrounding the White House.In addition, she had the advantage of not having to fight for the party's nomination to replace Biden, as she gained the support of other contenders before the Democratic National Convention last month. Even if two still unresolved keys on foreign policy achievements or failures fell in Trump's favour, they would not be enough for him to win the election, according to Lichtman's formula. Lichtman, however, ignores polling trends, campaign tactics, and events.Even an event like Taylor Swift's endorsement has little bearing on Lichtman's 13-point model. However, that can shape public perception and even voting turnout. \"None of these ephemeral events, not the debate, not the purported attempted assassination, not JD Vance saying he made up a story about immigrants eating cats and dogs... None of that changes the fundamentals of the election,\" Lichtman said. But is America really ready to elect a woman of colour to the presidency and create history? Is it really that simple this time?\"My prediction is that Kamala Harris will win in 2024, but everyone still needs to VOTE,\" Lichtman stated recently. It should be mentioned that despite his success, Lichtman's methodologies have frequently been questioned by political scientists, pollsters, and other historians who claim that his model is unscientific and too simplistic.And, to be honest, assessing some of the keys is quite subjective. And one wonders, amid the waves of opinion polls, if similar \"keys\" may be created for the Indian elections as well - possibly by sifting through historical election data?Given the complex, heterogeneous, and multifaceted nature of our elections in a truly multi-party system where various strong regional parties and various types of pre- and post-poll alliances exist and undergo constant evolution, that may be a more daunting and subjective endeavour. Can any political pundit, though, attempt to formulate such a model? That might add more fun to election prediction, for sure.The writer is Professor of Statistics, Indian Statistical Institute, KolkataSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on October 16, 2024",

    "content": "New texts have emerged of alleged secret communication between Liz Cheney, former January 6 committee vice chair, and a key witness.Former White House official Cassidy Hutchinson was due to testify that she saw then-President Donald Trump agreeing with January 6 rioters who were chanting \"Hang Mike Pence,\" the then-vice president.Republican National Committee member, Harmeet Dhillon, wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday: \"This is a very serious ethical violation and lawyers can be disciplined by the bar for contacting a represented party concerning the subject matter of the representation, without the permission and knowledge of that party's lawyer.\"The Congressional Committee on House Administration has issued a statement in which it says that Cheney, then a Republican congresswoman who was strongly opposed to Trump, had used third-party communications to arrange a meeting with Hutchinson before her 2022 testimony.Cheney, who lost her seat later in 2022, has been a frequent target of pro-Trump Republicans. She announced this year that she will vote for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.In a statement, the Committee on House Administration's Subcommittee on Oversight said that its Republican chairman, Barry Loudermilk, \"obtained never-before-seen correspondence between January 6 Select Committee Vice-Chair Liz Cheney and Cassidy Hutchinson and in 2022, while Hutchinson was still a subject of the Select Committee's investigation.\"The statement added: \"In the months prior to Hutchinson's explosive private and public testimony, Cheney communicated with Hutchinson, both directly and through an intermediary -- Alyssa Farah Griffin -- while Hutchinson was represented by her attorney, Stefan Passantino.\"Newsweek sought email comment from Cheney and Griffin on Wednesday.It is clear from the communication that Griffin told Hutchinson that Cheney wanted \"a follow up with you, with your lawyer that she and  Dan George can lead.\" This suggests that both Cheney and Griffin wanted to ensure that Hutchinson had legal representation at the meetings. The January 6 committee conducted six interviews of Hutchinson in total.\"Farah Griffin and Hutchinson knew each other from their time working together in the White House. Farah Griffin was one of the first former Trump administration officials to publicly criticize Trump in January 2021, and was publicly working with the Select Committee on its investigation,\" the oversight committee's statement reads.Hutchinson and Griffin met in Washington, and the former told the latter that she had new information to give the January 6 committee.\"Her new testimony would include her never-before-heard story that alleged that President Trump agreed with rioters chanting 'Hang Mike Pence,'\" the statement reads.\n\"However, it appears that Cheney knew communicating with Hutchinson while Hutchinson was represented by an attorney and a subject of the Select Committee's investigation, without going through Hutchinson's attorney, would be unethical\" the statement continues.\"This is evident by Farah Griffin's text to Hutchinson that Cheney's 'one concern was so long as  you have counsel, she can't really ethically talk to you without him,'\" the oversight committee's statement adds.",

    "content": "Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents uncovered a massive drug haul of blue fentanyl pills that may be worth more than $11 million stashed in a vehicle in California.Officers discovered 122 pounds of narcotics concealed within the vehicle's quarter panel during a routine inspection at the Calexico West Port of Entry on Oct. 9, the agency said in a statement dated yesterday.The estimated street value of the drugs is thought to be about $11 million based on a previous 123.6-pound discovery of blue fentanyl pills in March. Newsweek contacted the CBP to confirm the estimated value of the drugs.During the initial inspection, which involved a CBP K-9 sniffer dog unit, officers discovered the packages and referred the driver and the vehicle for further examination. A 47-year-old man was then taken into custody, suspected of attempting to smuggle the drugs into the United States from Mexico.CBP officers uncovered a total of 98 packages concealed within the vehicle's quarter panels and back headrest. The substance tested positive for fentanyl, according to CBP.Homeland Security Investigations has launched a full investigation into the matter, and inquiries remain ongoing.\"This fentanyl pill seizure is a big win in our fight against the opioid crisis,\" Roque Caza, area port director of Calexico, said in the statement. \"Every pill off the streets is a life potentially saved. I commend our hardworking CBP officers and law enforcement partners for keeping our communities safe.\"The latest drug bust is part of ongoing CBP efforts to intercept and prevent the trafficking of illicit narcotics into the country.Terri Beth Miller, senior editor at Rehab.com, told Newsweek that the CBP \"urgently\" needs more personnel to deal with the \"surge\" of drugs flowing through the southern border.\"Fentanyl is infiltrating communities across the U.S. No city, state, or region is immune. However, the overwhelming majority of fentanyl seizures, more than 95%, occur at the southwestern border of the U.S.\"Though illegal border crossings are often blamed for the surge of fentanyl into the US, the reality is that fentanyl is most commonly smuggled into the U.S. through legal ports of entry.\"This speaks to the urgent need for more DEA, Customs and Border Patrol resources at the southern border. A surge of law enforcement personnel, border agents and drug interdiction technologies is desperately needed.\"Immigration and border security are key issues in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election, as both Republicans and Democrats want to see curbs on migration.According to a poll by Gallup, 55 percent of respondents who back Donald Trump's calls for curbs wanted to see immigration levels decrease.A slight majority of respondents back Trump's flagship border wall policy from 2016, as 53% support significantly expanding the construction of walls along the U.S.-Mexico border, up 13 points since 2019.In an Economist/YouGov poll conducted in August, former president Trump led Vice President Kamala Harris by 51 points among adults who said immigration was \"very important\" to them-with 83 percent saying they planned to back Trump compared to 32 percent who said they would vote for Harris.Polling by Redfield and Wilton Strategies shows that 47 percent of respondents trust Trump on immigration compared to 36 percent who trust Harris. That is a gap that has been closing in recent weeks, as border crossings have fallen sharply in the aftermath of President Joe Biden's executive order limiting asylum claims.",

    "content": "With only 20 days left before Election Day, when voters will have their final say on who they want to be the next president of the United States, both candidates appear locked in a dead heat as they race toward the White House.However, aside from Arizona and Georgia, where Trump leads by 1.6 and 1.1 points, respectively, 538's polling aggregates show the candidates separated by less than a point in the remainder of the battlegrounds. With margins so narrow, just a few thousand votes could determine the outcome in this year's crucial swing states, and the election as a whole.In an online poll, we asked: 'Who will win the 2024 election?' Over a thousand readers took part, with Harris achieving a slight lead over her rival. Newsweek readers from both camps also wrote in to share their predictions - and thoughts - on who will be crowned victorious in the 2024 presidential election. Here is a selection of those comments, lightly edited for clarity. The results of the poll are at the end of this article.In my opinion, his experience by far outshines that of Harris. Trump's intuition is right on target and he cares for the country. He's capable of dealing with the global political master-minds, whereas Harris's capability here is doubtful. In my opinion, his actual opinion re. Ukraine is more favorable towards the E.U. stance than seems apparent. And the \"proof in the pudding\" is that with him we had no wars and small businesses were not hampered by the many restrictions Democrats, who wish to control everything and everyone, place on them. That's my story and I'm sticking with it - An Independent voter. Maija CollinsDonald is not competent. He has no ideas. His concepts are from the Heritage Foundation. He is a puppet, and Heritage is running the show. He is emulating Orban. He is a copycat politician. He cannot think on his own. He is too old, and he is divisive.

Murder decreased more than 11%, while rape fell roughly 9%.The decreases follow a sharp uptick in crime during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the murder rate spiked in its largest single-year increase on record. Violent crime then ticked back down slightly in 2021 and again in 2022, according to the FBI's national crime estimates.Crime rates have become a key issue in the 2024 presidential election. Monday's report on violent crime trends runs counter to claims by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has repeatedly attacked Democratic rival Kamala Harris for her record on crime and safety and claimed without evidence that migrants who cross the border illegally are responsible for a rising tide of violent crime.President Joe Biden, in a statement, praised the decline in crime, noting his administration's investments in public safety and executive actions on guns. Harris said that while the numbers represented \"great progress, we are not stopping now.\"\"I am committed to continuing our work to support local law enforcement, invest in proven crime prevention and community violence intervention, and address gun violence with commonsense gun safety laws,\" Harris, a former prosecutor and district attorney in California, said.Crime has generally been trending down since the 1990s. The continued decrease in 2023 is unsurprising given preliminary data that had already been released, but it's hard to explain exactly what's driving the change, according to Jeff Asher, a crime-data analyst who has worked at the CIA and Department of Defense.\"You talk to 10 criminologists, and you might get 10 different answers,\" Asher told USA TODAY. \"So explaining it is very difficult with any form of crime data, especially when you're sort of in the middle of the trend.\"In the latest report released Monday, aggravated assaults declined an estimated 2.8% and robbery fell 0.3%. Despite the overall decrease, instances of certain offenses, including motor vehicle theft and hate crimes, rose in 2023, according to the FBI, which cautioned that the increase in hate crimes could be due to higher reporting.Trump has said that if he's reelected, he would institute the death penalty for human traffickers and drug dealers, and he does not believe federal statistics like the FBI's report showing that violent crime trends are declining. FBI officials declined to comment when asked about Trump's claims in a call with reporters but said the agency's methodology has been consistent.Ernesto Lopez, a senior research specialist at the Council on Criminal Justice noted that while national trends are moving one way, the effects may not be felt equally in all cities, which could lead to public misconceptions about crime rates.Law enforcement agencies in the nation's largest cities - those with at least 1 million people - showed a 7% decrease in violent crime in 2023, while communities with between 250,000 and 499,999 people reported a 0.3% increase, FBI data showed.\"It's a complicated story, but it's also one that's consistent with past findings that perceptions don't necessarily match the numbers,\" Lopez said.FBI report: Reported hate crimes at schools and colleges are on the riseReport Violent crime rates in American cities largely fall back to pre-pandemic levelThe FBI found motor vehicle thefts rose more than 12%, while the Council on Criminal Justice found the thefts increased 29% in just 34 cities, Lopez said. Both Lopez and Asher said TikTok videos showing viewers how to steal certain models of cars may have contributed to increases.Violent crime rose 5.6% during the COVID-19 pandemic and nationwide protest movement following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Violent crime went down 1% in 2021 and another 1.7% in 2022, according to the FBI's national crime estimates.\"Whenever you have a period of rapid social change, it's not necessarily uncommon that you could see crime increase,\" Lopez said. \"And so as you start moving away from that and other social forces begin to normalize, you would expect crime trends to sort of return back to where they were before, and I think that's what we're seeing to some extent.\"Hate crimes have been on the rise in the United States for several years, but national hate crime data is notoriously flawed because it's not mandatory for all of the country's more than 18,000 law enforcement agencies to submit data on hate crimes. In 2023, roughly 16,000 agencies submitted data to the FBI.Adjusting for year-to-year fluctuations and using data from agencies with more consistent reporting, the FBI found hate crimes actually fell by 0.6% from 10,687 in 2022 to 10,627 in 2023, the agency told reporters.Other datasets show the true total is likely much higher, Brian Levin, professor emeritus and founder of the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino previously told USA TODAY. Levin's analysis of the nation's 10 most populous cities found hate crimes reported to police increased 16% in 2023, according to a draft of the report.Asher said his data from about 300 cities, known as the Real-Time Crime Index, indicates murders have dropped even more sharply this year. Preliminary reports published this summer from the Major Cities Chiefs Association and the Council on Criminal Justice also show crime has continued to drop in 2024.Lopez said the decline can possibly be attributed to large drops in homicides in cities that historically have high rates, while cities with historically lower homicides rates have remained elevated.\"I think overall, you know, it looks promising,\" he said. \"What we're seeing with a lot of violent crime  from the FBI report, but also from our report, is that it doesn't appear to be trending back up.\"",

    "content": "Former President Donald Trump's odds of winning the presidency in November soared to a 16-point lead over his Democratic opponent Kamala Harris on the leading prediction website Polymarket this week.As of Tuesday afternoon, the site gave Trump a 58% chance of winning the 2024 presidential election in three weeks, compared to a 42% chance for Harris. The spike represents the Republican's biggest lead on the site since July 31.Harris sits at her lowest Polymarket odds since the Democratic National Committee (DNC) controversially declared her as the party's nominee in early August.Polymarket indicated Tuesday that there is a 26% chance Trump will sweep all seven battleground states on November 5 - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.Click here to \nThe site also gave Trump a 16% chance of winning all but one of those swing states.At the time, Polymarket listed Trump's odds of carrying Arizona at 68%, Georgia at 64%, North Carolina at 63%, Pennsylvania at 56%, Michigan at 54%, and Wisconsin at 53%.Nevada was the only swing state where Polymarket gave Harris an advantage, albeit a razor-thin one of 51% to Trump's 50%.However, even if Trump loses Nevada to Harris, he would still win the election with 306 electoral votes if he gains the support of all the states in which Polymarket currently shows he is leading.One week ago, Polymarket had given Trump a smaller 52.6% chance of winning the 2024 election compared to Harris' 46.7% chance.As CatholicVote noted last week, before Monday, October 7, \"Harris was considered by the site's odds to be the slight favorite to win the election since September 12 - two days after the sole debate between her and Trump.\"On Tuesday of last week, Polymarket gave Harris a slight 53% advantage in the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Trump now enjoys roughly the same advantage in both states, according to Polymarket.On Monday morning, political commentator Collin Rugg wrote on X (formerly Twitter): \"Bettors are becoming increasingly confident Trump will win the election as he surges to nearly a double-digit lead.\"Trump's eight-point Polymarket lead then doubled within a day.\"The development comes as a new NBC News poll shows Trump pulling even with Kamala Harris after being behind by 5 points in their poll last month,\" Rugg pointed out.CatholicVote previously reported that Polymarket \"brands itself as 'the world's largest prediction market.'\"\"Via one of its web pages, it states that its markets 'seek truth' and 'reflect accurate, unbiased, real-time probabilities for events that matter most to you,'\" CatholicVote indicated.",

    "content": "Two recent movies about former U.S. presidents have had significantly different starts at the box office.The Apprentice took $482,803 per day on average during its first four days, earning a high of $590,628 on its opening day and $317,980 on its fourth -- the latest daily figure available -- on October 14.Reagan took $2.58 million per day on average during its first four days, raking in $2.7 million on its opening day and $2.65 million three days later on Labor Day.Reagan has appeared in more theaters. At its peak it was screened at 2,770 venues compared to 1,740 cinemas so far showing The Apprentice.The Reagan biopic was universally panned by critics, being dubbed \"the worst kind of hagiography\" in The Boston Globe and \"the worst movie of the year\" on The Daily Beast website.Yet the movie appeared to go down well with audiences, defying box office expectations and earning a 98 percent score among verified audience reviewers on movie-rating site Rotten Tomatoes at time of publication.Reagan was independently financed, with a grassroots marketing campaign which paled in comparison to some advertising budgets for Hollywood movies. Directed by Sean McNamara, it was loosely based on The Crusader: Ronald Reagan and the Fall of Communism, a 2006 book written by Paul Kengor.The Apprentice was made with a $16 million budget and tells a version of Trump's life in New York in the 1970s and 1980s, focusing on his relationships with his lawyer Roy Cohn and his first wife, Ivana Trump.The movie stars Sebastian Stan as Trump, Jeremy Strong as Cohn and Maria Bakalova as Ivana Trump.The Trump biopic also faced a huge challenge to be released in theaters, after struggling to find a distributor after it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in France in May. Director Ali Abbasi described making the movie and then getting it released as the \"most challenging thing I've ever done.\"\"When we were at  Cannes and we got a standing ovation and everyone was so happy and flattering, I was thinking there was going to be a bidding war, do I want to go with Warner or Netflix, who do I want to pick?\" he told the BBC, adding that \"it was extremely difficult for us to get a distributor,\" which he believed was because Trump threatened legal action.Trump criticized the movie on his social media platform Truth Social before it premiered.\"A FAKE and CLASSLESS Movie written about me, called, The Apprentice (Do they even have the right to use that name without approval?), will hopefully 'bomb,\" the Republican presidential candidate in November's election wrote.\"It's a cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country, 'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!'\"",

    "content": "Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump holds a campaign rally in Reno, Nevada, U.S. October 11, 2024. REUTERS/Fred GreavesOne complicated congressional law could stand between the White House and a former president Donald Trump armed with legal wiles rather than Electoral College votes, according to a new analysis.Georgetown University Law Center professor Neal Katyal argued Wednesday in a New York Times editorial that the nation should brace itself for a sprawling legal battle should Trump lose the presidential election to Vice President Kamala Harris in November.\"The rogues are no longer amateurs,\" wrote Katyal. \"They have spent the last four years going pro, meticulously devising a strategy across multiple fronts -- state legislatures, Congress, executive branches and elected judges -- to overturn any close election.\"Katyal details several paths a defeated Trump could take to seize executive power -- among them challenging ballots in swing state lawsuits, sowing chaos on local election boards and forcing fake electors on allies in the state legislature -- before landing on the one through Congress.His analysis comes with good and bad news introduced with an alarming disclaimer.\"The Congress has the power to swing the entire election,\" Katyal said. \"The rules are complex -- even as a law professor I can barely make sense of them.\"Katyal's good news is a 2022 law that made it more difficult for a Congressional member to object to a state's vote by mandating 20 percent of members in both houses sign on to the challenge, which must win a simple majority in both chambers as well.ALSO READ: People have had enough': Here are the 3 'big-picture' reasons why Kamala Harris will winThe bad news Katyal previewed in his disclaimer.\"The rules are so complicated that they could be stretched, wrongly, to give Congress the power to select the next president by sustaining bogus objections,\" he wrote. \"Don't get me wrong, such maneuvering is totally inconsistent with the 2022 law. But it can be attempted and create chaos.\"Katyal is not optimistic that certain members of Congress will put correct legal interpretation above loyalty to their party's presidential nominee.The Republican Party, according to Katyal, can no longer be trusted to hold democratic norms as sacrosanct.\"We have much to fear,\" Katyal wrote.\"It does not require much imagination to see a bad faith actor in Congress try to squeeze through bogus election fraud theories and plunge the country into uncertainty on Jan. 6,\" Katyal wrote.\"The 20 percent voting threshold is meant to avoid crackpot election fraud theories, but these days more than 20 percent of Congress might be inclined to support a crackpot theory.\"The safest bet to ensure the protectors of election integrity survive the 2024 presidential election is for Americans to vote for the candidate who has never tried to dismantle them, the law professor argued.\"If either candidate wins the Electoral College decisively,\" he concluded, \"any dispute will be rendered academic.\"",

Threat actors have created and are selling 'phishing kits', which help criminals impersonate US presidential candidates and their funding campaigns, on sale for $1260.The kits can be used to collect credit card numbers and other personal details.Over a thousand new domain names with links to the election have been created since the start of the year, sparking more concern as many of these sites are designed to mimic legitimate campaign donation sites.According to the research, the darknet has become a cesspool of cyber-activity related to the election.Social security numbers, email addresses and passwords make up some of the billions of personal details listed across darknet forums.Around 3% of posts across the darknet involve businesses and government associations in the US, only intensifying concern about account takeovers, identity theft, and other cyber-crimes.The amount of usernames and passwords generated from these organisations, amounting to 1.3 billion, increases the risk of effective credential stuffing attacks.US government agencies have continually been targeted in ransomware attacks, which saw an overall rise of 28% in 2024.If these attacks are successful and data is encrypted, they could disrupt the electoral process or damage the reputation in the system.Simple preventative measures and basic cyber hygiene can make a big difference in quelling this surge in attacks, Fortinet says.Multi-factor authentication and regular software updates, as well as endpoint protection and cybersecurity training, are important steps in keeping systems secure.",

    "content": "Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate in the 2024 Presidential Election, faced widespread ridicule following a video of him struggling to load his shotgun during a pheasant hunt.The incident, which was meant to showcase Walz as a gun-friendly candidate, backfired spectacularly, drawing mockery from conservatives and hunters alike.The video, which quickly spread across social media, shows Walz fumbling with a Beretta A400 Xcel Sporting semi-automatic shotgun (a very relatable $2000.00+ shotgun), sparking questions about his authenticity as a hunter. Although Walz has claimed to be a lifelong bird hunter, his awkward attempt to load the firearm has left many skeptical.As conservative commentator John Cardillo put it, \"Tim Walz claims that he's a lifelong bird hunter, but this clearly proves he has no idea how to load or charge a semi-automatic shotgun.\"The blunder didn't end with Walz's loading mishap. According to Fox News, despite spending three hours in the field, Walz failed to shoot a single pheasant, a detail that only fueled the mocking comments online.Walz's attempt to connect with gun owners by showing his hunting skills seemed to fall flat with the very voters he was trying to reach. The Harris campaign had hoped to leverage Walz's Midwestern roots and supposed firearm expertise to sway undecided voters in swing states, especially in the Rust Belt. However, the media debacle has instead drawn attention to Walz's past statements on gun control and his fabricated combat service record.Social media users were quick to jump on the blunder, with some likening Walz to the classic Looney Tunes character Elmer Fudd. Twitter user @delinthecity_ quipped, \"He looks like Elmer Fudd,\" while @Greg_n_Cincy sarcastically asked, \"Think he could load a paintball gun? He loves those things.\" The comments only intensified as the video gained traction. One user remarked, \"If a person buys a racing car, it doesn't mean that person can drive it,\" while others questioned Walz's overall competence with firearms.Some commenters made comparisons to Dick Cheney's hunting accident where he shot another hunter: @jackie1321_67 \"Don't go near this shotgun-fumbling knucklehead. He's about to \"Cheney\" some innocent bystander.\"Perhaps the harshest commentary came from conservative voices who questioned the judgment of the Harris campaign for allowing such a spectacle to be broadcast. As one user jokingly pointed out, \"The fact that 'the campaign' was willing to put this out shows that we have people on the inside.\"Despite the Harris campaign's efforts to appeal to gun owners by highlighting Walz's supposed gun-owning credentials, the pheasant hunting debacle has only reinforced the perception that their ticket is out of touch with Second Amendment supporters. For many, this incident was just another example of a politician attempting to pander to voters in a way that felt forced and inauthentic.",

    "title": "CHAPTER 43: Ideological Subversion, Communitarianism, and the 15-Minute City",
    "content": "Globalism is a replacement ideology that seeks to reorder the world into one singular, planetary Unistate, ruled by the globalist elite. The globalist war on nation-states cannot succeed without collapsing the United States of America. The long-term strategic attack plan moves America incrementally from constitutional republic to socialism to globalism to feudalism. The tactical attack plan uses asymmetric psychological and informational warfare to destabilize Americans and drive society out of objective reality into the madness of subjective reality. America's children are the primary target of the globalist predators.Globalists recognize neither individual nor national sovereignty. Globalism's planetary Unistate will be one-world population, one-world nation, one-world government, one-world language, one-world currency, one-world bank, one-world culture, one-world customs, one-world ethics, one-world morality, one-world norms, one-world court, one-world laws, and one-world military police enforcing one-world compliance.Marxism and globalism are both replacement ideologies. The Marxist strategy for ideological conversion relies on regressing chronological adults back to childish thinking through fear, and weaponizing education to indoctrinate children in collectivism as young as possible. The globalist strategy for world domination exploits the Marxist strategy to clear the path for the globalist Unistate.To understand what is so attractive about the state of childhood for megalomaniacs, we must return to our earlier discussion of power and control in Chapter 36, and consider the universal source of conflict between power and powerlessness that begins in childhood. It is often said that everything is political. That is true. Everything is political because everything is ideological. Everything is ideological because thoughts are ideas, and thought precedes behavior. Some ideologies support individual freedom and some support state tyranny.We are all born completely helpless and dependent upon our caretakers. An ideal childhood would have parents who love, nurture, and teach their children the skills necessary to become empowered, independent, autonomous, rational adults capable of becoming loving parents who will repeat this cycle of life. The goal is ideological, and requires family support to preserve and sustain it generationally.Adult independence, responsibility, and agency are required to support the individualism and meritocracy required for a life of ordered liberty and upward mobility in a constitutional republic. Our constitutional republic is a political structure supported by an ideological commitment to freedom and liberty, sustained by the Judeo-Christian morality that supports individualism, adulthood, and the nuclear family. These qualities are anathema to societies of rulers and ruled, because the dependence and powerlessness of early childhood are required to sustain the tyranny of binary power structures such as globalism and Marxism.In order to collapse America from within, it is necessary to subvert Americans ideologically and replace their strivings for adulthood with dependency needs. Yuri Bezmenov, a former KGB propagandist, worked as a \"journalist\" inside the Western countries he was tasked with subverting. Bezmenov defected to Canada in 1970 and began giving lectures and interviews to warn Western nations about ongoing Soviet tactics being used to subvert their countries.In his 1984 interview with G. Edward Griffin, Bezmenov explained that the main focus of the KGB was not espionage. The emphasis was on ideological subversion using covert Soviet \"active measures,\" particularly psychological warfare and disinformation. During the interview, Bezmenov defined the four stages of ideological subversion involved in a communist takeover of a Western country:Takes 15-20 years to educate one generation without any counterbalance.II. DESTABILIZATION (2-5 years)Destabilization of economy, foreign relations, and military.Creation and acceptance of the new normal. Lasts indefinitely.Bezmenov explained that the Marxist goal is to change perceptions of reality to such a degree that no one is able to come to sensible conclusions about how to defend himself, his family, or his country. It is brainwashing to the extent that facts no longer matter, and is exactly the same psychological warfare that Bertrand Russell describes in The Impact of Science on Society when he advocates weaponizing education such that children will eventually believe that snow is black. Ideological subversion and psychological warfare are the reasons why space is no longer the final frontier -- reality is.The mechanism for ideological subversion is psychological regression. I won't give the Soviets credit for understanding WHY regression works, but they definitely knew that it DOES work. And it doesn't matter how intelligent or accomplished the individual is; those qualities are completely irrelevant. I explain the mechanism of psychological regression in Dear America: Who's Driving the Bus? Fear regresses chronological adults to psychological childhood. If you frighten someone enough, you regress them back to a state of childish psychological thinking and compliance in a world of subjective reality. Children believe what they are told, no matter how factually absurd it is -- for example, the COVID fear campaign with its masking, jabs, social distancing, vaccines that are not vaccines, and endless booster shots. In talking with people regressed by active measures, you may think you are speaking to an adult, but you are actually interacting with a psychological three-year-old.Can you have a rational debate with a three-year-old? No, of course not. That is why ideological subversion is psychological warfare -- and why it is so catastrophically effective. I cannot say this often enough or strenuously enough: Freedom is an adult enterprise.Globalist social engineers are master strategists who live in objective reality and understand the infantile nature of Marxist collectivism. They know Marxist promises of equality and earthly delights historically end in tyranny, and only regressed adults ignore history, insisting that each new iteration of Marxist collectivism will be the real one.Globalists fund and foment Marxist ideological destruction to clear the path and soften America for globalist objectives. Every species of ideological Marxism, including critical race theory, Wokeism, queer theory, radical feminism, and post-colonial theory, is being used to advance the globalist war effort. The globalist coup d'état cannot succeed without collapsing America.The will to power is nothing new. What is new is the post-World War II strategy to bring down the United States ideologically, from within. Ideological Marxists continue to believe in the Culture War, its long march through American institutions, and the historical inevitability of communism. But Marxist devotees, including the leadership, are simply useful idiots being used by the globalists in their War on America. They do not recognize the transitory nature of their power to swing the cultural wrecking ball. It is the globalists, not the Marxists, who control the science and technology required to facilitate the Fourth Industrial Revolution, impose its one-world planetary Unistate, and eventually eliminate dissent and dissenters, including the Marxists.Globalist social engineers are using their coordinated narrative of fear to regress free people all over the world. If we are to remain free, we simply must remain psychological adults living in objective reality. How do we accomplish this?First, we acknowledge that we are a world at war, and we demand of ourselves that we always live in the adult world of objective reality. Fortunately, there are role models that can help us understand what this means. Author/activist Rosa Koire explained how the European Union (EU) has already accepted communitarianism. So, let's begin there.Rosa Koire (1956-2021) wrote Behind the Green Mask: U.N. Agenda 21 (2011), explaining how the foundation of Agenda 21/2030 is communitarianism. Koire was a forensic commercial real estate appraiser specializing in eminent domain valuation. She was a District Branch Chief for the California Department of Transportation and an expert witness on land use and value. In 2005 she was elected to a citizens' oversight committee to review a proposed 1,300-acre redevelopment project in Santa Rosa, Northern California, where 10,000 people lived and worked.Through her research, Koire discovered that much of the funding for UN Agenda 21/Sustainable Development land use programs came through diversion of property taxes to development agencies. Koire's book explains that Sustainable Development is an inventory and control plan for all land, water, minerals, plants, animals, construction, means of production, food, energy, information, and all human beings in the world. In other words, the planetary ecology. In 2013 she did a video interview in Denmark titled Rosa Koire: \"Agenda 21\" Open Mind Conference 2013. Six years later the same interview was reposted and retitled Rosa Koire: UN Agenda 2030 exposed. Much of Rosa Koire's work has already been deleted from the internet. Her 2013 interview exposed the catastrophic impact of Sustainable Development on private property rights and liberty. Its relevance today is chilling. The interview is preserved in its entirety below.I'm Rosa Koire and I'm from the United States, California, and my topic, what I speak about is one of the most vitally important issues of our age and that is the United Nations Agenda 21 Sustainable Development. And as I'll be talking about tomorrow, it is the inventory and control plan. Inventory and control of all land, all water, all minerals, all plants, all animals, all construction, all means of production, all food, all energy, all information, and all human beings in the world. And this is a plan that was agreed to by a hundred and seventy-nine nations back in 1992.It's a United Nations plan, it's called the \"Agenda for the 21st century,\" and so many of us around the world think that sustainable development, it just sounds so great. Isn't it about recycling and creative reuse and creating energy and food resources for everyone? And the answer is No. It really is not. It's about moving populations into city centers, concentrated city centers, and clearing them out of the rural areas. So, I became, I found out about it in a very unusual way actually, because I spent my career as a legal witness, as an expert witness for the California Department of Transportation. I'm an expert in land use and land valuation, and my specialty is in eminent domain valuation. Of course, I was valuing property for the government so that the government could acquire that property for road projects, and what I found about ten years ago, by around or 10 or 15 years ago, was that land actually, it was very difficult to say what it was worth because you couldn't know what people could do with it, because they were being restricted from using their property. And as I explored that, and found that it wasn't just in the San Francisco Bay Area where I was working, it was in fact all across the nation and the world. I looked behind that and I found United Nations Agenda 21 Sustainable Development.We created the Post Sustainability Institute in order to educate people about the economic, social, political, and environmental impacts of communitarianism on the world. And communitarianism is that concept, that social and political construct that says that the individual's rights should be balanced against the rights of the community. And, of course, the community is that amorphous undefined community that we, you know when we talk about community, we think we're of course part of it and that, you know, it's a positive thing. But really community is, constructed, it's constructed of non-governmental organizations, corporations, and government, in order to dictate and regulate what it is that happens around the world. And we as individuals have literally no influence on that unless we are in agreement with it. If you dissent against the community, against communitarian law or against communitarian social tactics, you're rejected and basically made an outcast. And that is something that that we wanted to expose to the world and the reason that we created a Post Sustainability Institute was in order to sue.We sued our local government and right now we're suing a higher-up in order to stop regional plans because regionalization is the stepping-stone to globalization, and globalization is the standardization of all systems. So, that includes water, law enforcement, education, energy, all systems have to be brought into harmony in order to control them all. Because when systems don't meet, when they're out of balance or not synced with one another, they can't be controlled centrally. And the goal of Agenda 21 is one-world government and total control from a central unit.America, the United States of America, is really under attack right now. We in the United States are, well, the U.S. landmass is about two and a half times the size of Europe and has roughly half the population. Just over half that landmass is huge and about 75% of the population lives in large cities. The goal is to move everyone out of the rural areas and into the large cities, and to destroy representative government, and to move it into to a government by unelected boards and commissions.Now here in the EU of course you have, you know, you've already moved to that position, where it's an erasure of jurisdictional boundaries an erasure of national boundaries, and that is the goal because as Zbigniew Brzezinski said in 1995, you can't just impose globalization pell-mell as a total movement, you have to do it incrementally. And the way to do that is through regionalization. And in Denmark, for instance in Denmark, well, every nation that signed on to Agenda 21 has its local Agenda 21 plan. People in the United States are completely unaware of this. If I go out and talk about this the United States, press attacks me and calls me a conspiracy theorist, which is totally ridiculous. It is a conspiracy, but it's not a theory. It's a fact. Here in Europe, it's openly spoken about, local Agenda 21. And, of course, here in Denmark the Aalborg Principles 2000 excuse me, 1994, and then Aalborg +10, 2004, was the European roundtable for local Agenda 21, was held here. And the Principles are public-private partnerships, which is fascism, and this is how it's implemented on the ground. Is through this joining together between corporations, non-governmental organizations, and governments in order to cut out the, you know, the actual individual, your voter. And instead to take that to a level where we literally cannot penetrate, and this is the goal. So, this is already far progressed in Europe.The three pillars of United Nations Agenda 21 are Economy, Ecology, and Equity. The three E's -- the social equity -- and everyone sort of thinks that they know what that means. The idea of social equity must mean that, well, everyone's going to have access to clean water and clean air, and no one's property is going to be used as a dumping ground because they are at a poverty level.But really, what social equity is about, it's about impoverishing huge portions of the population and bringing down the developed nations. And while this sounds like, you know, it sounds almost like in the United States, you'd call that a right-wing point of view, a conservative right-wing point of view. I personally am a liberal. The idea that something this drastic, this radical, would be happening worldwide without people knowing it. All you have to do is look at austerity measures; restrictions on transfers of wealth; additional restrictions on land use; ability, you know, to produce, to use your energy, your water, your industry; all of this is happening in developed nations. So, when you have your infrastructure attacked like that, it's going to have a tremendous impact on your ability to prosper. As well as the idea that everything that we're looking at now is destined to collapse our economies. Because the idea, this is a corporatocracy, it's a totalitarian state being developed right now all over the world.And what major corporations want in this fascist development is to be able to have full movement of workers without borders or boundaries. To be able to move their goods through without regulations and to reduce wages. And so, this is the goal, this is what you find with social equity, that's code for social equity, for this movement and reduction of the population. And of course the economy and ecology is about bringing into balance economy, these are the three circles, Economy, Ecology, and social Equity. And where they meet in the center is balance.But really that balance is a communitarian balance. So, it's not balance of well-being of the people, what it is is it's a balance or corporation so that they can exploit and control and have populations in an area in tightly packed dense areas so that they can be surveilled and managed. And this is what that balance looks like as far as the development of totalitarian state.I think it's very important to know that the people now still have an opportunity to fight. All of us across the world understand that our individuality is at stake here. Our most important private property is our body, and of course surveillance is a vital part, surveillance, domestic surveillance and control, is a vital part of this plan. It is a totalitarian plan. But you know, just like any other extreme plan, while we are moving towards the endgame, we are not there. And this is the opportunity that all of us have now to stand up, to speak out, to refuse to collaborate, to refuse to cooperate. To expose collaborators, to work together to defund these plans. To refuse, to demand what it is the corporations want to give us and so, because no one's holding a gun to our heads right now, we have that opportunity.If that changes, if that moment changes, you certainly won't protest then, so now is the time. And people all over the world are doing this. It's that the mainstream media is owned by five major corporations, and you're not going to get this information from the mainstream press. So, you need to be your own press. You need to educate yourself. You need to get out there and educate your neighbors, your community, your real community. You need to help your children understand that they're being indoctrinated from pre-kindergarten to postgraduate school.All of us have a responsibility to ourselves and to others. This is true community, to work for personal freedom and always remember that even though we work as a group, if we do work as a group, we're all individuals in those groups and we answer only to ourselves. And this is essential, it's essential as free human beings. This is what we are -- we are free and we need to continue to be free. And I do believe that we will win, but we have to become aware that there is a fight, and then make our friends and our neighbors and our community aware as well, and work together.Right now, in the United States we are moving into major massive regionalization. The United States has 50 states, and it's divided into cities, counties, and states, and then the federal government. Instead, Agenda 21 is top-down. It's global, regional, neighborhood, and none of those positions is elected. So, in the United States right now, the development of regionalization is happening very quickly. It's happening with federal funding. There are hundreds of millions of dollars going to local governments in order to have them create regional plans. And this plan cannot be accomplished without control of land and land use, because of course where you live often dictates the kind of life you're going to have.So, regionalization takes away our opportunity to have an impact. It takes away representative government. So, what we are doing at the Post Sustainability Institute right now is we are suing to stop the biggest regional plan in the United States, and it is a blueprint for the rest of the country. What this plan is doing is essentially saying that no new development will happen anywhere. But in 4% of the San Francisco Bay Area that all 101 cities and nine counties will be joined together and all land-use decisions will be made basically by an unelected Board. What this will do to land use and land value in the San Francisco Bay Area, to movements of people, to development of business, to freedom, is unfathomable. And people are not aware of it. The only thing that is standing between that and full passage is our lawsuit.Now what this truly means is if you tell people that they have to build only \"smart\" growth, high-density development in an urban center right on a train line. Or, the train doesn't have to be there, it's the proposed idea of a train line, and then no development, no buildings, no residential, no commercial, can happen outside of that very, very concentrated area, then what do you have? You have a concentration camp of the future.This is exactly what it looks like and you see it's very much more subtle and much more sophisticated than it was when the Nazis were doing it. You are not going to get thrown on a train car, you will just have your roads out in the rural areas pulverized and turned to gravel. You'll have your family well monitored, you will have your energy restricted, you will have your school service cut, your Sheriff service cut. You will find that you are not able to get your goods to market, and then you have to move into the city, and then you will move into this high-density development that is subsidized with our property tax dollars, and pretty soon you will have the Wildlands Project, which is predicated on moving people out of the rural areas.This is how it happens, so you know people say, \"Well, hey, nobody's getting me off my land.\" Well, it's very easy. You know, no one's going to come to your door with a gun, but they will move you off your land. And you will be in the cities and those cities will be full capability of surveillance, monitoring, and control. These buildings, these high-density buildings, are being built with a concept of eyes on the street. You become basically a deputized police adjunct. Your job is to watch the street. Your job is to watch your neighbor.The war on terror is a war on you, and we all know this. We feel it. This is why we need to stop it. So, this is our plan, to use the courts at this point and stop this plan. And we're working on it.Koire's plan was to make people aware, and to use the courts to stop the plan. She understood that land use is the institutional path to high-density developments and surveillance modeled after China's system: physically (forcefully if necessary) moving the population to 15-minute city centers where they will be surveilled and controlled.Land use is parallel to political medicine. Both weaponize institutional power to increase social control by the state. Life in the Unistate is the beginning of Humanity 2.0, where all living things are part of the planetary ecology of communitarianism and Scientism's evolutionary ascendancy to transhumanism. Science and technology made Brzezinski's 1970 predictions come true, and science and technology are being used to make globalist megalomaniacal dreams of technocracy and transhumanism come true. Cognitive warfare will make life in the Unistate an existence of totalitarian conformity, serfdom, and compliance with the orthodoxy of Scientism.Member of the European Parliament Christine Anderson is an unyielding opponent of globalism and Klaus Schwab's Great Reset agenda. She is one of the few remaining politicians actually representing the interests of the people. In a September 13, 2023, session devoted to COVID-19 response and the World Health Organization, she ended the meeting with this powerful statement posted verbatim on Vigilant News, with emphasis added.We just need to find a way to wake the people up. Because the point is simply this: it comes down to a choice. It's either freedom, democracy, and the rule of law -- or enslavement.There is no such thing  in between. There is no such thing as a little freedom, a little democracy, a little rule of law, just as there is no such thing as a little enslavement. So that's the choice. It comes down to -- it's either the globalitarian misanthropists or the people. It comes down to -- it's either us or them. And that's, I think, what this really is all about.Now, when my colleagues and I were elected to this parliament, there was no question about it: we were on the side of the people because the people actually pay us to act in their best interests. That's our job. And once again, I will say to every single elected representative around the world, to every single member in every elected government around the world, if you do not unequivocally stand with the people and serve in their best interests, act in their best interests, you have no place in any parliament or in any government. You belong behind bars. You may even rot in hell for all I care at this point because that's exactly what you deserve if you sell out the people.Now, I would like to make a promise to the people, and I'm pretty sure I can speak  or speak on behalf of my colleagues. We will continue to stand with you, the people. We will continue to fight for freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. We will not shut up, and we will not stop going after those despicable globalitarian misanthropists.But we would also like to have you make a promise to us. You may have heard it's all coming back. The first country is already starting mask mandates in Israel. They're already imposing it. I've heard of a few universities in the United States. They're already bringing it all back. And I would really like for you, the people, to not go along. Simply say no! They want you to wear a mask: say no. They want you to put in another mRNA shot: say no. They want to impose a curfew on you: say no. That's really all you have to do.And it might not be or might sound a little hard, but it's actually not that hard. Because once you have made it clear to them that you will no longer go along, once you've let them know, they cannot scare you anymore. Because as long as you are afraid of what they might do if you don't comply, they have power over you. Take the power away from them! Simply say no. Once you do that, they don't have power over you anymore. You will feel so free. Simply say no.And considering what we've heard today, and considering what we've seen in the last three years, considering what we know they want to implement, heck, you might even be well within your right to tell them to screw themselves and go to hell! That's where they belong. What will you get out of that? I can tell you. Once you've done that, once you've told them to just go to hell, they no longer have power over you. You will have an incredible feeling -- kind of like a sensation of freedom will sweep through your body. I promise you will feel so relieved.And this is the state of mind that I would ask all of you to get to. Simply don't let them grind you down anymore. You are worth it. You are deserving of just standing up for yourselves. And tell them all to go to hell. Thank you very much.Christine Anderson is an MEP for Germany's anti-immigration party, Alternative for Germany (AfD), and an outspoken critic of Canada's Justin Trudeau. In March 2022 she accused Trudeau of openly admiring the Chinese dictatorship, and criticized him for trampling on \"fundamental rights by persecuting and criminalizing his own citizens as terrorists just because they dare to stand up to his perverted concept of democracy.\"Anderson speaks on the international stage, but to resist globalism we must stand against it locally. On September 20, 2023, Canadian citizen Joel Sussman stood before the Aurora, Ontario, City Council and schooled them on globalism and its existential threat to freedom. Joel Sussman's videotaped statement below:Good evening. Restructuring of Canadian mayors and municipalities under the auspices of the United Nations began in 1992. PM Mulroney signed Canada onto UN Agenda 21. Canada thus became a UN member nation-state. One hundred seventy-eight  countries signed on, lured by the promise of big money to go green. By 2000, countries, including Canada, were being governed by directions of the UN, G7, G20, World Economic Forum, and World Health Organization, to name some.Every organization named is a foreign-based NGO, non-governmental organization, and every member of all these organizations is unelected. Parliamentary procedures for law changes weren't followed. In 1994, a municipal primer was issued to all local towns, outlining how they were to restructure their governments.Though the municipal primer was a non-binding agreement, all towns adopted it. Our public officials, the mayor and councilors of that day, were partnered with a private corporation, the Corporation of the Town of Aurora, who appointed a chief administrative officer who helped implement the global agenda instead of a local one.The International Council on Local and Environmental Issues, ICLEI, became the main source of consultation to push and fund the global agenda. We remind you that the World Economic Forum and the United Nations signed a strategic partnership framework in 2019 to jointly accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.This is the same World Economic Forum whose chairman, Klaus Schwab, famously declared \"you will own nothing and be happy.\" This is the same Klaus Schwab who, referring to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, boasted, \"We have penetrated more than half of his cabinet.\" We would ask Mayor Maracas and the Councilors: Why should the citizens of Aurora bow down to the intrusive dictates of an unelected foreign entity?The fact is we should not. And we will not. What, you ask, does any of this have to do with 15-minute smart cities? Absolutely everything. Smart: S for surveillance, M for monitoring, A for analysis, R for reporting, and T for technology. Technocracy News editor Patrick Wood, 50 years of experience and expertise on technocracy, wrote, \"The 15-minute city is a cover for  data collection bonanza for technocrats who design and operate them.\"Cities designed for maximum efficiency always reveal technocrat thinking that efficiency itself is the goal. Maximum surveillance allows for maximum control to achieve even more efficiency. At its very root, this mechanistic thinking is anti-human. The 15-minute city narrative seeks to fool you in the guise of saving the planet, keeping you safe, and delivering convenience.It's actually the gateway to digital IDs and CBDC, Central Bank Digital Currencies. CBDCs allow bankers and/or governments to freeze your bank account because you happen to peacefully and lawfully protest and express your disagreement with government policy. Does anyone remember the truckers' convoy in Ottawa, February 22,  when the government of Canada invoked the Emergencies Act and froze the private bank accounts of law-abiding citizens?Fifteen-minute cities are wolves in sheep's clothing. Don't believe the countless stories spewing forth from the 24/7 bases, from the elitist-captured mainstream media, all claiming to have your best interests at heart. We have been burned too many times. In reality, 24/7 surveillance through the Internet of Things inside your home, 5G, and LED streetlights outside, monitoring and tracking and recording everything. Implementation of exclusion zones and geofencing to restrict movement and travel. Ability to control behaviors through military-directed energy technologies, property and car ownership to be outlawed, evictions from farms and rural areas to go to gather people into cities. Digital passports being promulgated by the UN World Economic Forum and the World Health Organization are in the final stages of planning and implementation. They are tied to social credit score, which is determined by compliance to government directives. These passports control all access and all aspects of life. Digital currency is being implemented to end cash and monitor all your spending. Your digital currency will be turned off or on depending on your compliance score. UBI, Universal Basic Income, is a state-controlled allowance forcing compliance by restricting access to food, money, services, and education.All of the above will enable climate lockdowns to be implemented easily, arbitrarily, and indefinitely.The real agenda of 15-Minute Smart Cities is to monitor and control everyone and everything. In summary, in the coming days, Council will receive an electronic info packet which will contain the text of this delegation and other items. We, the citizens of Aurora, wish to enter into a meaningful, respectful dialogue with our elected members of Council on this complex, important issue.A key framework of that dialogue is a list of questions posed to Council. Can Council explicitly guarantee that citizens will remain free to travel as is their right under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms? Can Council guarantee not to restrict access to essential services, medical care, bank accounts, government pensions, utilities?Most importantly, we the citizens of Aurora need to have the conversation with the Council about exiting their non-binding agreement with the private for-profit entity known as the Corporation of the Town of Aurora. We need to turn back the page to a simpler time when open, transparent municipal government serving its citizens and working in their best interests ruled the day.We are your equal partners on this journey. Thank you.Joel Sussman received an enthusiastic one-minute standing ovation from the gallery.For me, the most disturbing aspect of Sussman's speech was the City Council's response. The Aurora, Ontario, city councilors entrusted with public policy politely thanked Sussman for sharing his views, but appeared completely unaware of the history, government restructuring, public-private partnerships, and global agenda they were actively participating in against the public interest.This is an information war. City councilors who rely solely on information from globalist sources are participating, wittingly or unwittingly, in the globalist war on humanity. What is happening in Aurora, Ontario, is happening elsewhere. Citizens must take the responsibility and initiative, as Joel Sussman did, to provide facts challenging the globalist narrative that city officials are blithely and naively accepting.Joel Sussman is a role model for freedom-loving citizens. Here in the United States, citizens in every state, in every county, and in every city should attend city council meetings and read Joel Sussman's transcript out loud into the public record.Resistance requires accurate information and the courage to stand against the herd. Stopping the globalist advance requires being a psychological adult, living in the adult world of objective reality based on facts. Activist Rosa Koire, MEP Christine Anderson, and Citizen Joel Sussman possess the courage of their convictions, and have provided us all with demonstrations of what that courage looks like. Now it is up to us.America's freedom clock is ticking, and the globalist social engineers are in the final stages of their war on humanity. The next fear campaign is coming. It will probably be another bioweapon release, marketed as a worldwide pandemic far more contagious than COVID-19. It will be exploited politically as a catastrophic event necessitating the exclusive use of mail-in ballots in the 2024 presidential election -- for public health, of course. Anyone who objects will be accused of voter suppression. If not a bioweapon, then I predict the globalists will incite social chaos with some outrageous action or policy that ends with fighting in the streets. The goal is to make society totally ungovernable. Then the globalists will declare martial law -- for public safety, of course.After martial law comes feudal serfdom in globalism's planetary managerial Unistate -- a scientific dictatorship ruled by the elite, who always and only take care of themselves.

    "content": "Two recent movies about former U.S. presidents have had significantly different starts at the box office.The Apprentice took $482,803 per day on average during its first four days, earning a high of $590,628 on its opening day and $317,980 on its fourth -- the latest daily figure available -- on October 14.Reagan took $2.58 million per day on average during its first four days, raking in $2.7 million on its opening day and $2.65 million three days later on Labor Day.Reagan has appeared in more theaters. At its peak it was screened at 2,770 venues compared to 1,740 cinemas so far showing The Apprentice.The Reagan biopic was universally panned by critics, being dubbed \"the worst kind of hagiography\" in The Boston Globe and \"the worst movie of the year\" on The Daily Beast website.Yet the movie appeared to go down well with audiences, defying box office expectations and earning a 98 percent score among verified audience reviewers on movie-rating site Rotten Tomatoes at time of publication.Reagan was independently financed, with a grassroots marketing campaign which paled in comparison to some advertising budgets for Hollywood movies. Directed by Sean McNamara, it was loosely based on The Crusader: Ronald Reagan and the Fall of Communism, a 2006 book written by Paul Kengor.The Apprentice was made with a $16 million budget and tells a version of Trump's life in New York in the 1970s and 1980s, focusing on his relationships with his lawyer Roy Cohn and his first wife, Ivana Trump.The movie stars Sebastian Stan as Trump, Jeremy Strong as Cohn and Maria Bakalova as Ivana Trump.The Trump biopic also faced a huge challenge to be released in theaters, after struggling to find a distributor after it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in France in May. Director Ali Abbasi described making the movie and then getting it released as the \"most challenging thing I've ever done.\"\"When we were at  Cannes and we got a standing ovation and everyone was so happy and flattering, I was thinking there was going to be a bidding war, do I want to go with Warner or Netflix, who do I want to pick?\" he told the BBC, adding that \"it was extremely difficult for us to get a distributor,\" which he believed was because Trump threatened legal action.Trump criticized the movie on his social media platform Truth Social before it premiered.\"A FAKE and CLASSLESS Movie written about me, called, The Apprentice (Do they even have the right to use that name without approval?), will hopefully 'bomb,\" the Republican presidential candidate in November's election wrote.\"It's a cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country, 'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!'\"",

    "title": "Border Agents Seize $11 Million Worth of Blue Fentanyl Pills",
    "content": "Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents uncovered a massive drug haul of blue fentanyl pills that may be worth more than $11 million stashed in a vehicle in California.Officers discovered 122 pounds of narcotics concealed within the vehicle's quarter panel during a routine inspection at the Calexico West Port of Entry on Oct. 9, the agency said in a statement dated yesterday.The estimated street value of the drugs is thought to be about $11 million based on a previous 123.6-pound discovery of blue fentanyl pills in March. Newsweek contacted the CBP to confirm the estimated value of the drugs.During the initial inspection, which involved a CBP K-9 sniffer dog unit, officers discovered the packages and referred the driver and the vehicle for further examination. A 47-year-old man was then taken into custody, suspected of attempting to smuggle the drugs into the United States from Mexico.CBP officers uncovered a total of 98 packages concealed within the vehicle's quarter panels and back headrest. The substance tested positive for fentanyl, according to CBP.Homeland Security Investigations has launched a full investigation into the matter, and inquiries remain ongoing.\"This fentanyl pill seizure is a big win in our fight against the opioid crisis,\" Roque Caza, area port director of Calexico, said in the statement. \"Every pill off the streets is a life potentially saved. I commend our hardworking CBP officers and law enforcement partners for keeping our communities safe.\"The latest drug bust is part of ongoing CBP efforts to intercept and prevent the trafficking of illicit narcotics into the country.Terri Beth Miller, senior editor at Rehab.com, told Newsweek that the CBP \"urgently\" needs more personnel to deal with the \"surge\" of drugs flowing through the southern border.\"Fentanyl is infiltrating communities across the U.S. No city, state, or region is immune. However, the overwhelming majority of fentanyl seizures, more than 95%, occur at the southwestern border of the U.S.\"Though illegal border crossings are often blamed for the surge of fentanyl into the US, the reality is that fentanyl is most commonly smuggled into the U.S. through legal ports of entry.\"This speaks to the urgent need for more DEA, Customs and Border Patrol resources at the southern border. A surge of law enforcement personnel, border agents and drug interdiction technologies is desperately needed.\"Immigration and border security are key issues in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election, as both Republicans and Democrats want to see curbs on migration.According to a poll by Gallup, 55 percent of respondents who back Donald Trump's calls for curbs wanted to see immigration levels decrease.A slight majority of respondents back Trump's flagship border wall policy from 2016, as 53% support significantly expanding the construction of walls along the U.S.-Mexico border, up 13 points since 2019.In an Economist/YouGov poll conducted in August, former president Trump led Vice President Kamala Harris by 51 points among adults who said immigration was \"very important\" to them -- with 83 percent saying they planned to back Trump compared to 32 percent who said they would vote for Harris.Polling by Redfield and Wilton Strategies shows that 47 percent of respondents trust Trump on immigration compared to 36 percent who trust Harris. That is a gap that has been closing in recent weeks, as border crossings have fallen sharply in the aftermath of President Joe Biden's executive order limiting asylum claims.",

    "content": "Former President Donald Trump's odds of winning the presidency in November soared to a 16-point lead over his Democratic opponent Kamala Harris on the leading prediction website Polymarket this week.As of Tuesday afternoon, the site gave Trump a 58% chance of winning the 2024 presidential election in three weeks, compared to a 42% chance for Harris. The spike represents the Republican's biggest lead on the site since July 31.Harris sits at her lowest Polymarket odds since the Democratic National Committee (DNC) controversially declared her as the party's nominee in early August.Polymarket indicated Tuesday that there is a 26% chance Trump will sweep all seven battleground states on November 5 - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.Click here to \nThe site also gave Trump a 16% chance of winning all but one of those swing states.At the time, Polymarket listed Trump's odds of carrying Arizona at 68%, Georgia at 64%, North Carolina at 63%, Pennsylvania at 56%, Michigan at 54%, and Wisconsin at 53%.Nevada was the only swing state where Polymarket gave Harris an advantage, albeit a razor-thin one of 51% to Trump's 50%.However, even if Trump loses Nevada to Harris, he would still win the election with 306 electoral votes if he gains the support of all the states in which Polymarket currently shows he is leading.One week ago, Polymarket had given Trump a smaller 52.6% chance of winning the 2024 election compared to Harris' 46.7% chance.As CatholicVote noted last week, before Monday, October 7, \"Harris was considered by the site's odds to be the slight favorite to win the election since September 12 - two days after the sole debate between her and Trump.\"On Tuesday of last week, Polymarket gave Harris a slight 53% advantage in the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Trump now enjoys roughly the same advantage in both states, according to Polymarket.On Monday morning, political commentator Collin Rugg wrote on X (formerly Twitter): \"Bettors are becoming increasingly confident Trump will win the election as he surges to nearly a double-digit lead.\"Trump's eight-point Polymarket lead then doubled within a day.\"The development comes as a new NBC News poll shows Trump pulling even with Kamala Harris after being behind by 5 points in their poll last month,\" Rugg pointed out.CatholicVote previously reported that Polymarket \"brands itself as 'the world's largest prediction market.'\"\"Via one of its web pages, it states that its markets 'seek truth' and 'reflect accurate, unbiased, real-time probabilities for events that matter most to you,'\" CatholicVote indicated.",

    "title": "'God gives us guidance in who to elect' in Exodus: NHCLC speaker",
    "content": "WASHINGTON -- Several Christian leaders are encouraging the Latino Evangelical community to fully participate in the 2024 presidential election, contending that they have a mandate from God to help ensure the election of leaders who support biblical values.The National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, which represents thousands of churches throughout the United States and the Spanish-speaking world, hosted its 2024 Latino Evangelical Leadership Summit at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C. Tuesday. The annual gathering, which hundreds of people attended, took place three weeks before the 2024 presidential election this year.Several of the speakers encouraged members of the audience to take a direct role in the upcoming election. \"God gives us guidance in who to elect,\" said Debbie Wuthrow of iVoterGuide. She cited Exodus 18:21, which instructs people to \"select capable men from all the people -- men who fear God, trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain -- and appoint them as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens\" as the biblical guidance she was referring to.Wuthrow identified iVoterGuide as a tool created by God \"to equip you to identify those candidates at all  of office.\" She outlined its key feature, \"an election resource in all 50 states\" where \"you and your congregation enter your address\" and get a personalized ballot and that includes candidates ranging from \"president down to school board with an evaluation of where they land politically.\"Wuthrow stressed that while information about federal candidates is available for all 50 states, 32 states have facts about state legislative candidates and 12 have profiles of \"select school board candidates.\" She plugged iVoterGuide as \"a free tool for the church\" that has information about \"13,000 candidates.\"Another one of the speakers, Mary Thomas, works with the Job Creators Network, an organization that partners with the NHCLC. She told the audience that \"the Latino Christian community\" has \"the power to determine the outcome of this election.\"Thomas insisted that the Latino Christian community \"must get our families, our friends, our churches out to vote\" in support of \"biblical values.\" She maintained that the election amounted to a choice between \"leaders who support freedom and biblical values\" or \"leaders who will continue to attack the principles that we believe in.\"Thomas also highlighted several of the issues she thought Christian voters should keep in the back of their minds on Election Day, specifically lamenting that \"children being taught things that are against our biblical values in schools\" such as the idea \"that boys can be girls instead of being taught how to read, write and do math.\"Thomas also expressed outrage about \"our daughters being attacked in bathrooms\" by trans-identified men and \"elected leaders who push the murder of innocent babies even after they are born,\" referring to politicians who oppose providing life-saving care to babies who survive botched abortions.\"Our elected leaders who are determining the laws and the future of our nation do not reflect our values,\" she proclaimed. \"But we as people of strong faith know that in the end, the kingdom of God will always prevail. And we know that we must now take action to defend our faith and our biblical values.\"Thomas maintained that \"we must let our Father speak through us to save our nation.\" She reiterated that \"With God's guidance and strength, God has given us the power to determine the future of this nation, to return it to what it used to be and what it must be: One nation under God.\"\"These last 21 days, we need all of you to step up and please speak to your church members, your communities, your friends and your families,\" she added.The Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, NHCLC president, invited the Rev. Johnnie Moore to offer a prayer for \"this election and for the sovereignty of God\" and that \"every Latino Christian will vote.\" Moore currently leads the Congress of Christian Leaders, an organization established to unify Christian movements worldwide, and previously served as a commissioner on the U.S. Commission for International Religious Freedom.\"What a travesty it would be for us to have inherited so much and to pass down so little to the next generation,\" Moore remarked. \"We entrust the future of our nation to you.\"Highlighting the role of the U.S. as a beacon of religious liberty for those around the world, Moore stressed the obligation to \"keep the light held high\" and \"to defend our own religious freedom\" to ensure that persecuted Christians around the world \"have any hope of it whatsoever.\"Moore told God \"We are asking you to intervene in every way for the good of our country.\" Moore pushed back on the idea that the Evangelical community wants a \"weird theocracy,\" asserting that \"We just want to be left alone to preach the Gospel to the ends of the earth.\"The pleas from Christian leaders urging Latino Christians to make their voices heard in the 2024 presidential election come amid concerns that many faith-based voters are planning on abstaining from voting in it. A recently released report from the Cultural Research Center at Arizona Christian University estimates that 32 million self-identified Christians who regularly attend church services are slated to sit out the election.",

Waters, 86, spoke about her expectations leading up to the 2024 Presidential Election during an interview with TMZ on Monday.The U.S. representative for California's 43rd congressional district told the news outlet that though polling shows Harris and her main rival Donald Trump are tied, she explained that \"the national poll\" provides a better insight about which candidate is ahead.\"You can't always count on , but I think the campaign with the great get-out-the-vote  is gonna win -- and that's gonna be Harris-Walz,\" she stated.Asked if she was nervous about the election, Waters said that was not the case. She urged people who were feeling nervous to make sure they have a say in who leads the country.\"I don't think you have to be nervous, you have to do something,\" Waters said. \"You have to be involved. If you are involved in any way that you can then you're not nervous, you're more confident.\"READ ALSO: Texas man who threatened Rep.

If Vice President Harris, 59, defeats Trump in November, she would not only be the first woman to serve as president but also the first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to be president thanks to her roots.Harris has already achieved a lot of firsts in her more than two decades in public life. Her feats include being the first Black woman to serve as San Francisco's district attorney, the first woman to be California's attorney general, the first Indian American senator, and the first woman vice president of the U.S.Following her confirmation as the Democratic Party's presidential nominee, several celebrities and public figures have thrown their support behind her candidacy.

    "title": "How the CIA's dirty tricks shape US elections  --  and you",
    "content": "In my new book, \"Twilight of the Shadow Government: How Transparency Will Kill the Deep State,\" I describe in detail how the Central Intelligence Agency manipulates the U.S. government and its military-industrial complex contract corporations. The CIA attempts to influence not only foreign government elections but U.S. elections as well -- a deeply disturbing aspect of what I call the shadow government, aka the deep state.This pattern dates to the administration of John F. Kennedy. During Kennedy's presidency, the CIA conducted covert operations without his knowledge. Furious, JFK fired rogue CIA Director Allen Dulles, who held a deep grudge against him. It surprised no one in Congress when, after Kennedy's assassination, Dulles was put in charge of the Warren Commission, which investigated the president's murder. Dulles handpicked and coached all CIA witnesses who testified before the committee.The CIA is manipulating a presidential election, right in front of the American people -- again.The CIA also played a direct role in the rise of former President Bill Clinton. As governor of Arkansas, Clinton entered into a secret agreement with then-Vice President George H.W. Bush -- another notorious CIA figure -- to use the Mena, Arkansas, airport to run guns and drugs to and from the Nicaraguan Contras.I was a CIA officer during that time. The CIA was under investigation for committing felonies behind Congress' back (and, of course, behind the backs of the American people). I have no doubt that the CIA gave then-Gov. Clinton a CIA clearance, bringing him into direct contact with \"the Company.\"Despite supposedly being political enemies, Bush and Clinton maintained a close relationship until Bush's death in 2018. From my perspective, Clinton's direct connection to the CIA helped him rise from relative obscurity to the presidency, making him yet another useful president for the CIA.George H.W. Bush had a decades-long affiliation with the CIA, which he tried to downplay by claiming he only worked with the agency during his brief tenure as director in the mid-1970s. In reality, Bush was a CIA officer as far back as 1953, when he partnered with CIA officer Thomas Devine to form Zapata Petroleum, working under commercial cover. Their oil wells were located just 40 miles from Cuba.One of Bush's tasks as director was to manage the fallout from the CIA's Operation Mockingbird. During a news conference, Bush stated that the CIA would no longer recruit American journalists to be on the agency's payroll. What many missed, however, was his follow-up comment: From now on, reporters and the news media could work with the CIA on a voluntary basis. The CIA has a unique way of turning \"voluntary\" into a requirement, establishing a quid pro quo with major media companies. This arrangement prevented outlets from publishing exposés on CIA activities while providing them with intelligence-derived information to manipulate public opinion.When Bush became vice president in 1981, it essentially placed the CIA in the second-highest seat of the U.S. government. I am convinced that Bush was the agency's mastermind behind the criminal Iran-Contra operation, once again manipulating a president to engage in illegal covert activities.Under President Barack Obama, the CIA implemented a drone assassination program that targeted at least eight wedding parties, killing innocent civilians. The CIA convinced Obama to maintain a kill list of foreigners it considered dangerous, often based on unproven suspicions. In effect, Obama allowed the CIA to act as judge, jury, and executioner.Obama arrested and jailed more intelligence whistleblowers than any previous president, using the outdated Espionage Act. The most notable of these was former CIA case officer John Kiriakou, a top performer in the CIA Counterterrorism Center, who was imprisoned on frivolous charges.During the Obama administration, notorious CIA Director John Brennan made several covert trips to Ukraine to underwrite the 2014 coup, which resulted in the Russia-Ukraine war and the ensuing proxy war between the United States and Russia, bringing America to the brink of World War III.While Donald Trump was president, the CIA launched a full-scale operation to remove him from office for daring to question the agency. Brennan initiated the Russia collusion hoax by leaking the \"Steele dossier,\" a complete fabrication based on false information from Russian intelligence officials. Brennan misled the press, claiming the dossier was CIA intelligence. I have provided an in-depth analysis of this CIA operation on YouTube (@kevinshipp1). This was the CIA's attempt to stage a domestic coup and take down a sitting president. Although the plot failed, no CIA or FBI official faced accountability for their crimes.After Joe Biden's victory, evidence surfaced of Biden's involvement in Ukraine following the 2014 CIA-orchestrated coup. This led to the discovery of Hunter Biden's laptop, which contained salacious videos, along with evidence of sex, drugs, and guns. To protect Biden, 51 former intelligence officials, including 42 senior CIA officers, quickly signed a public statement claiming the laptop story was \"Russian disinformation.\" That was a lie. We must remember that the CIA's core functions include lying, deception, and propaganda, especially when protecting its own existence.We now know the CIA convinced Facebook and Twitter executives to promote Biden for president and censor posts supporting Trump. The cover for the operation? Posts and articles supporting Donald Trump were \"Russian disinformation.\" Russia is always the CIA's boogeyman.This brings us to the upcoming 2024 presidential election. I am an independent, and I am not endorsing either party. My goal is to remain objective and unbiased. The CIA is up to its dirty tricks again, attempting to sway public opinion in the direction of the agency's chosen candidate, Kamala Harris. All 42 of the aforementioned senior CIA officers (the most notorious being Mike Morrell, who attempted to sway the 2016 presidential election in Hillary Clinton's favor) have issued a statement supporting Kamala Harris for president and attacking Trump. That's along with 741 \"national security leaders\" who have endorsed Harris.The CIA is manipulating a presidential election, right in front of the American people -- again.",

MSNBC's net negative is lower, at 4%, with 40% holding a favorable view and 44% holding an unfavorable view.Those net negative margins increase among independent voters, with a 10% net negative for CNN and 9% for MSNBC among the key demographic. Even among college-educated voters, the perception still leans negative; CNN has a 3% net negative margin among this group, while MSNBC's is just 2%.

The CIA was under investigation for committing felonies behind Congress' back (and, of course, behind the backs of the American people). I have no doubt that the CIA gave then-Gov. Clinton a CIA clearance, bringing him into direct contact with \"the Company.\"Despite supposedly being political enemies, Bush and Clinton maintained a close relationship until Bush's death in 2018. From my perspective, Clinton's direct connection to the CIA helped him rise from relative obscurity to the presidency, making him yet another useful president for the CIA.George H.W. Bush had a decades-long affiliation with the CIA, which he tried to downplay by claiming he only worked with the agency during his brief tenure as director in the mid-1970s. In reality, Bush was a CIA officer as far back as 1953, when he partnered with CIA officer Thomas Devine to form Zapata Petroleum, working under commercial cover. Their oil wells were located just 40 miles from Cuba.One of Bush's tasks as director was to manage the fallout from the CIA's Operation Mockingbird. During a news conference, Bush stated that the CIA would no longer recruit American journalists to be on the agency's payroll. What many missed, however, was his follow-up comment: From now on, reporters and the news media could work with the CIA on a voluntary basis. The CIA has a unique way of turning \"voluntary\" into a requirement, establishing a quid pro quo with major media companies. This arrangement prevented outlets from publishing exposés on CIA activities while providing them with intelligence-derived information to manipulate public opinion.When Bush became vice president in 1981, it essentially placed the CIA in the second-highest seat of the U.S. government. I am convinced that Bush was the agency's mastermind behind the criminal Iran-Contra operation, once again manipulating a president to engage in illegal covert activities.Under President Barack Obama, the CIA implemented a drone assassination program that targeted at least eight wedding parties, killing innocent civilians. The CIA convinced Obama to maintain a kill list of foreigners it considered dangerous, often based on unproven suspicions. In effect, Obama allowed the CIA to act as judge, jury, and executioner.Obama arrested and jailed more intelligence whistleblowers than any previous president, using the outdated Espionage Act. The most notable of these was former CIA case officer John Kiriakou, a top performer in the CIA Counterterrorism Center, who was imprisoned on frivolous charges.During the Obama administration, notorious CIA Director John Brennan made several covert trips to Ukraine to underwrite the 2014 coup, which resulted in the Russia-Ukraine war and the ensuing proxy war between the United States and Russia, bringing America to the brink of World War III.While Donald Trump was president, the CIA launched a full-scale operation to remove him from office for daring to question the agency. Brennan initiated the Russia collusion hoax by leaking the \"Steele dossier,\" a complete fabrication based on false information from Russian intelligence officials. Brennan misled the press, claiming the dossier was CIA intelligence. I have provided an in-depth analysis of this CIA operation on YouTube (@kevinshipp1). This was the CIA's attempt to stage a domestic coup and take down a sitting president. Although the plot failed, no CIA or FBI official faced accountability for their crimes.After Joe Biden's victory, evidence surfaced of Biden's involvement in Ukraine following the 2014 CIA-orchestrated coup. This led to the discovery of Hunter Biden's laptop, which contained salacious videos, along with evidence of sex, drugs, and guns. To protect Biden, 51 former intelligence officials, including 42 senior CIA officers, quickly signed a public statement claiming the laptop story was \"Russian disinformation.\" That was a lie. We must remember that the CIA's core functions include lying, deception, and propaganda, especially when protecting its own existence.We now know the CIA convinced Facebook and Twitter executives to promote Biden for president and censor posts supporting Trump. The cover for the operation? Posts and articles supporting Donald Trump were \"Russian disinformation.\" Russia is always the CIA's boogeyman.This brings us to the upcoming 2024 presidential election. I am an independent, and I am not endorsing either party. My goal is to remain objective and unbiased. The CIA is up to its dirty tricks again, attempting to sway public opinion in the direction of the agency's chosen candidate, Kamala Harris. All 42 of the aforementioned senior CIA officers (the most notorious being Mike Morrell, who attempted to sway the 2016 presidential election in Hillary Clinton's favor) have issued a statement supporting Kamala Harris for president and attacking Trump. That's along with 741 \"national security leaders\" who have endorsed Harris.The CIA is manipulating a presidential election, right in front of the American people -- again.",

    "title": "Despite Trump's Claims, Large Numbers of Noncitizens Don't Vote in US Elections",
    "content": "The idea that large numbers of noncitizens vote in U.S. elections has been disproven.Throughout his political career, former U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that the nation's electoral system is \"rigged\" against him. In the run-up to the 2024 presidential election, Trump and his allies spread rumors questioning the election's integrity even before votes were cast, with the apparent goal of persuading people that a Trump loss to Vice President Kamala Harris could not happen in a fair and just election.In particular, Trump has claimed that if he loses, it would be because a massive number of undocumented immigrants broke federal law and voted for his political opponents. (Trump uses the term \"illegal immigrants\" or \"illegals\" to refer to this group of people.)We boiled Trump's claims down to the following chain of events:Trump uses the rhetoric not just to challenge the integrity of the election, but also to indirectly attack the Democratic Party's pro-immigration stance and its policies regarding the U.S.-Mexico border.However, Trump's claims are contradicted by the following facts:Snopes found that Trump has publicly stated or implied that undocumented immigrants were voting in elections for at least a decade. In a tweet from October 2014, even before he announced his run for president in 2015, Trump claimed \"election officials\" said there were no protections preventing undocumented immigrants from voting in elections, which he said was \"very bad (unfair) for Republicans.\" He did not cite any sources.During the 2016 presidential race, Trump made similar comments. For instance, he questioned the security of same-day voter registration and cited a highly criticized set of data to claim that 14% of noncitizens in the United States were registered to vote.In 2020, Trump famously claimed there was a massive amount of voter fraud and refused to concede the election to Biden. Although his allegations of fraud during that election cycle did not focus on immigration, his efforts to sow seeds of doubt about the integrity of the U.S. electoral process took hold.During the 2022 midterm elections, some Trump supporters who believed he won the 2020 election became poll watchers who intensely scrutinized the election process. According to reporting from Reuters, multiple states recorded incidents of poll watchers intimidating voters and election workers, which is illegal. Additionally, the Republican National Committee (RNC) established a voter integrity program to ensure that the 2022 midterm results were fair.By December 2023, Trump was telling supporters at an Iowa rally to \"guard the vote.\" In April 2024, Trump's campaign announced it would partner with the RNC to continue its voter integrity program in the 2024 election, with the explicit intent, in the campaign's words, to \"stop Democrat attempts to circumvent rules.\" The allegation that undocumented immigrants are illegally registering to vote is only one idea the Trump campaign has used to justify these efforts.The claims spread quickly, however, and were shared by prominent figures like X owner Elon Musk. In September 2024, Reuters reported that Trump's legal team had already filed lawsuits that could be used to challenge the election on the grounds of noncitizen voting in four of the seven swing states expected to decide the election.The fact of the matter is simply that noncitizens rarely vote in U.S. elections, something the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank, reported on in 2020.A 2015 analysis of the survey Trump later used to claim that 14% of noncitizens in the United States were registered to vote found that the result was simply due to human error -- that is, all the \"noncitizens\" who marked themselves as registered to vote were almost certainly U.S. citizens who accidentally recorded themselves as noncitizens when taking the survey.In 2016 and 2017, the Brennan Institute for Justice, a liberal nonprofit organization, investigated 42 jurisdictions across 12 states to find out whether there was any truth to the claims of voter fraud. Of the 10 jurisdictions across the nation with the highest population of noncitizens, the survey looked at eight of them.According to the institute's report, voters cast 23.5 million votes in these jurisdictions in the election. The institute counted 30 cases of suspected noncitizen voting that required further investigation. That's an occurrence rate of 0.0001% -- less than the odds of being struck by lightning in your life.Under federal law, states are required to maintain and audit voter rolls regularly to ensure an election's integrity. As an example, the state of Georgia, expected to play a critical role in the 2024 election, audited its voter rolls in 2022. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, announced that the state found 1,634 cases in which a noncitizen attempted to register to vote between 1997 to 2022, about 65 per year. But according to the report, none of the individuals in those cases ever officially voted, thanks to the existing protections that safeguard the voter registration process.In order to illustrate the numerous protections in place to prevent noncitizens from voting in U.S. federal elections, let's go through the steps an immigrant residing in the country illegally would have to take in order to cast just one ballot and have it counted.First, this person would have to enter the United States without paperwork and apply for political asylum. During this process, the individual's name and other identifying information would be added to a federal database that marked them as a noncitizen.Second, this person would need to apply to register to vote (except in North Dakota, which verifies voter eligibility using a strict voter ID law). All 49 states with voter registration require the voter to attest under penalty of law that they are a U.S. citizen, that they are over the age of 18 and that they are a resident of the state they wish to vote in.These registration forms require applicants to provide a large amount of personal information. This is a problem for immigrants living in the country illegally, who may be afraid the government could use that identifying information to arrest or deport them. In this case, those fears are valid: Any noncitizen found guilty of such a crime would face prison time or deportation.During the voter registration process, the immigrant would have to prove they are a resident of the state they live in, most commonly using a driver's license or Social Security number. In order to apply for that documentation, the immigrant would have to provide more identifying information to the government alongside immigration paperwork that confirms their status as a noncitizen. At this point in the process, there would now be multiple governmental databases that list this person as a noncitizen.Then, each voter registration application is reviewed and cross-checked against driver's license and federal immigration databases from the Department of Homeland Security to scan for any discrepancies. If election officials have any suspicions, they can flag the application for further review. That process requires even more personal information from the voter. If there are still questions, election officials can always deny the application.There are a few jurisdictions in the United States, including San Francisco and Washington, D.C., where noncitizens are allowed to vote, but only in some local elections, not federal elections. In San Francisco, for instance, noncitizens are allowed to vote in school board elections only. However, noncitizens in these jurisdictions must register to vote using a specific form in a specific way. This means that such noncitizens are added to the voter rolls with the explicit knowledge that they are noncitizen voters, and their ballots can be tracked as such.All of these are incredibly effective -- again, Georgia's 2022 audit found that out of the 1,634 cases in which a noncitizen was suspected of attempting to register to vote, not one vote was ever cast. As Gerry Cohen, a member of the Board of Elections in Wake County, North Carolina, told Snopes: \"There's a big difference between registering to vote and actually voting.\"Taylor Kinnerup, communications director for the Maricopa County recorder's office in Arizona, added an additional distinction: \"There's also a big difference between casting a vote and that vote being counted.\"In October 2024, posts on X surfaced alleging that the Texas secretary of state had instructed poll workers to allow voters who presented an ID indicating they were a noncitizen to vote as usual. The claim quickly morphed into the general idea that Texas was allowing noncitizens to vote. This is untrue, because of the protections in place after a ballot is cast.In a directive \"to all election officials,\" Texas Director of Elections Christina Adkins told poll workers to acknowledge the noncitizen ID when checking for a valid voter registration, but pointed out that these voters might just be new U.S. citizens who had not yet updated their driver's licenses to reflect their citizenship status. Denying such eligible voters the right to cast a ballot would be a clear example of illegal voter suppression. The directive recommended that these voters present a different form of photo ID if possible to avoid the issue. Regardless, the work done to ensure that those voters are eligible is performed before the ballot is counted.After arriving at a polling place, voters are required to provide their name (and depending on the jurisdiction, their ID). These names are then checked against registration records (again, except in North Dakota). If there's a match, a ballot is printed for the voter. The voter then signs, affirming under penalty of law that they understand the penalties of casting a fraudulent ballot.The voter's signature is a part of the verification process. Kinnerup said that Maricopa County poll workers compare the signature to the voter's other recorded signatures before the ballot is opened and counted. Just like with voter registration, an election official can flag the ballot for further inspection if they have any doubts about the validity of the voter's signature.Under Section 302 of the Help America Vote Act, signed into law by then-President George W. Bush in 2002, voters who are not on a voter roll but attest that they are an eligible voter can still cast a provisional ballot in a federal election, something that might initially seem concerning. But even in this case, there are still protections. A provisional ballot is counted only if the voter's identity, citizenship and residency can be confirmed in the days following the election. Kinnerup explained the process using an example she said Arizona regularly deals with.\"California is a deep blue state, and some Republicans in Southern California might have the idea to cast a ballot in Arizona because it's a more competitive election,\" she said. \"So there are Republicans in Southern California who drive across the border to Yuma County, Arizona, walk into a polling place and ask for a ballot.\"By law, election workers are required to provide them with one. However, in order for these ballots to count, these voters would need to provide identification to confirm their citizenship and residency. Their California driver's licenses would be a red flag for poll workers, indicating that these voters were not Arizona residents, and the ballots would not be counted after investigating the voters' credentials.Some Republicans have claimed these precautions are still not enough. In April 2024, Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson met with Trump to discuss concerns of voter fraud and noncitizen voting. The bill resulting from that conversation, the SAVE Act, would have mandated that those wishing to register to vote show documented proof of U.S. citizenship. This means that in order to register to vote, voters would have to submit their birth certificate -- a document that 9% of Americans don't have immediate access to, according to research from the Brennan Center. Although the SAVE Act passed the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, the Senate refused to hold a vote on the bill.In September 2024, facing the threat of a government shutdown, Trump posted on his social media platform, Truth Social, calling for Republicans to reject any stopgap spending bill that did not include \"absolute assurances on election security,\" because Democrats were supposedly attempting to \"stuff\" voter registrations with undocumented immigrants. The SAVE Act was briefly resurrected at that point, but Democrats objected to its inclusion in the spending bill. Eventually, Johnson partnered with Democrats to pass a bill that did not include the SAVE Act in order to avoid a government shutdown.It is unclear whether Republicans will continue to pursue further legislation at the federal level to require proof of citizenship to register to vote. At the state level, according to the Brennan Center and the Voting Rights Lab, Arizona, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Hampshire and North Dakota have passed laws since the 2020 election that aimed to address nonexistent noncitizen voting using documented proof of citizenship.Part of what made Trump's claim of noncitizen voting stick is that it combined two of his favorite targets: election integrity and the U.S.-Mexico border. Much of this story has focused on disproving Trump's claims about election integrity. However, it is also important to examine what exactly Trump and his allies claim when criticizing or attacking Kamala Harris in that regard.The post claims that during a town hall with Latino voters, Harris said she wanted to allow \"illegal immigrants to become citizens who will then be able to vote.\"This is an explanation of the Democratic Party's immigration platform and a statement about the privileges of United States citizenship, not an admission that Harris is going to rig the election. Harris is stating a fact: that undocumented immigrants in the United States currently do not have a path to citizenship. Although it is true that giving undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship would eventually allow them, as naturalized citizens, to vote in U.S. federal elections, going through that process would likely take a long time. According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, lawful permanent residents are required to live in the United States for five years before they are eligible to apply for naturalized citizenship.Snopes found no evidence that a significant number of noncitizens are attempting to register to vote in the 2024 election. After explaining the large number of precautions in place to stop noncitizens from voting, both the election officials we spoke to said it is highly unlikely that a noncitizen would be able to successfully cast a vote if they tried, contrary to Trump's claimsCohen, the Wake County Board of Elections member, said he felt baffled by the scale of the claims. \"The thought that a large body of people are doing this is stupid,\" he said. \"It's hard enough to get people to vote as is.\"Kinnerup, from the Maricopa County recorder's office, said she thought people were believing Trump's claims because of a recent change in Arizonan politics. The demographics of Arizona have changed dramatically in recent years, and the media's struggle to predict the winner of Arizona in the last election probably made some voters feel like something had gone wrong.But she also wanted to remind voters that the poll workers were not the enemy. \"Everyone, Democrat and Republican, wants the election to be fair,\" she said. \"There's no such thing as a perfect election. But 2020 taught us a lot -- to prepare for the unexpected.\"",

    "title": "UPDATE: 32 million self-identified Christians expected to sit out of the 2024 presidential election",
    "content": "(OPINION) Upwards of 104 million people of faith -- including some 32 million self-identified Christians who regularly attend church services -- are expected to sit out of the 2024 presidential election.They are likely to hold back from the Nov. 5 contest due to a lack of interest, according to new data from Arizona Christian University's Cultural Research Center, operated by evangelical pollster George Barna. Voter enthusiasm, the study found, decreased significantly from 2020 to 2024.\"The research asked people who indicated they were not likely to vote to explain the reasons for that choice,\" wrote the researchers. \"The most common reason, offered by two-thirds of the non-voters (68%), was a lack of interest in politics and elections.\"More than half of survey respondents -- 57% -- said they dislike both leading candidates, Vice President Kamala Harris and President Donald Trump. And 55% said they don't feel either candidate reflects their values.Researchers reportedly believe that, if the survey's findings prove true on Election Day, Trump's re-election is less likely and Harris could more easily pull off a victory.Barna is encouraging pastors and ministry leaders to use their positions to urge churchgoers to practice their civic duty by casting their ballots on Nov. 5.\"Pastors often seek opportunities to have a positive influence in people's lives and upon the culture, and to help the community in which their church is located,\" he said.\"This research underscores the fact that simply encouraging people to vote in order to fulfill their biblical responsibility would not only be seen as doing their job while helping the community, but an estimated five million regular churchgoers would be likely to vote as a result of that simple exhortation.\"Last month, Dr. Jeff Myers, an author, speaker, and president of Summit Ministries, appeared on CBN's \"Faith vs. Culture,\" where he addressed the question: \"Should Christians avoid politics?\"When stepping into the ballot box, Myers urged Bible-believers to consider \"constitutional principles\" like \"life, liberty,  property,\" because those \"are the three things the Constitution said it's developed in order to provide.\"He explained, \"How do I support life with my vote? How about liberty -- things like religious liberty and free speech? What about property? Who's going to be most likely to think that people ought to have their own property and own businesses?Because there are a lot of worldviews out there, let's be honest, who say the abolition of private property would be a preferable state. So which candidate for any given office is going to be most likely to lessen the evils that occur around life, liberty, and property? ... That is going to help inform my decision.\"While there is plenty in the election cycle that can be discouraging, Myers argued the Bible calls Christians to participate in the process, noting that, in a constitutional republic like the U.S., the people are responsible for forming and holding to account their government.\"Who are the governing authorities?\" Myers asked rhetorically. \"The people. So, in this situation -- in the American context -- if you are a Christian and you are not involved, you are literally disobeying God's admonition to be obedient to the governing authorities.\"",

    "content": "As the 2024 presidential election approaches, Pitt students express a mix of excitement, anxiety and determination as they grapple with their role in the democratic process.In recent months, Pitt's campus has seen a surge in political activity, including visits by former President Barack Obama, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff and other Pennsylvania politicians. Many students said they're eager to vote for the first time, but while some say they remain optimistic about the country's future, others have voiced concerns about polarization and expressed frustration about an increase in apathy among their peers.To gauge the campus' sentiment towards the political atmosphere, The Pitt News spoke with 12 Pitt students about their thoughts about the upcoming election.Nicholas Ditmore, an undeclared first-year student, emphasized the significance of civic participation and expressed confidence in the country's resilience.\"I think that no matter what the outcome of this election is, going either way, our country is so strong that I think that our best days are ahead,\" Ditmore said. \"There's no worry coming from me.\"He said he believes both major parties have engaged in dangerous rhetoric and added that stoking fear about the nation's future is \"not good for our country.\"\"The rhetoric that our country is in danger is not a good thing that we should be saying. I think that we should tamp that rhetoric down,\" Ditmore said. \"The foundations of our country are insanely strong, and I think that no matter who wins, no matter what the outcome is, America is going to prosper.\"Ditmore also highlighted the positive political engagement on campus, noting that he sees lots of first-time voters who are excited for Election Day.\"I think that the amount of activity around the election on campus is very strong right now and I think that's a very good thing,\" Ditmore said. \"We are excited to vote, we're excited to choose the direction of our country ... it's not about going after one party or another, it's about coming together and actually voting for the future of this country.\"Other students shared mixed feelings about the election. Hayley Felan, an undeclared sophomore, voiced concerns about political polarization.\"I'm a little worried, because there's very drastic sides. Ever since the 2016 election, we have been becoming very polarized,\" Felan said. \"I feel like, even before that, it was starting to shift, because of the Right's concerning ideology.\"Felan said they feel some young voters have become more politically engaged following Vice President Kamala Harris' ascension on the ticket, but worried that others still feel apathy towards the democratic process.\"It was looking a little bleak, when Biden was running ... I feel like there was a lot of apathy, especially with students, because they felt like there wasn't really a good side to pick either way,\" Felan said. \"Now that Harris has come onto the ticket ... feelings about the election are going up, because people are more confident in her than they were .\"While some students express concerns, others maintain a more optimistic outlook. Jesse Milston, secretary of the College Republicans, shared his excitement for Republicans in the upcoming election.\"I feel really good about it. I feel very good about our candidates. We have a great slate, and I'm proud to know a lot of them,\" Milston, a sophomore political science and law, criminal justice and society major, said.Milston expressed confidence in Republicans' chances this November, but said no matter the outcome, America will \"prosper.\"\"Regardless of what happens, our country is going to be okay,\" Milston said. \"I just hope we have someone good to steer the helm.\"Some students, like Izzy Ronolder, said they are fearful about the election's potential outcomes.\"I'm so freaking scared,\" Ronolder, a senior social work majorhowever, said. \"No matter which way this goes, it's going to be bad. It just feels like it's going to be bad.\"Zaida Dayton, a junior psychology and gender, sexuality and women's studies major, said she's excited to vote in the upcoming election but reflected on the heightened news awareness many students reported feeling.\"I feel more tuned in because I feel like I'm paying attention to the debates that are going on,\" Dayton said. \"I feel scarily tuned in, but tuned in nonetheless.\"",

    "title": "Peter Schweizer: GAI Study Details 50 Threats to Election Integrity",
    "content": "It's election season in America, and that means early voting, absentee ballots, and making sure your voter registration is current.It's also a test of how well each state maintains its voter rolls, its election systems, and the ways each state assures its elections are conducted and counted fairly.A new report from the Government Accountability Institute (GAI) counts at least fifty threats to election integrity. The report, just out this week, categorizes fifty different threats to election integrity according to whether they concern the influence of \"dark money,\" lawfare operations, voter fraud, or election fraud. The report documents examples of each and offers potential solutions.On the most recent episode of The Drill Down, Peter Schweizer and co-host Eric Eggers tackle the many ways elections can be rigged and, more importantly, how to make sure that it doesn't happen.Many states have been conscientious about cleaning their voter rolls -- removing deceased voters, voters who have left the state, voters who are not U.S. citizens but who were registered through their driver's license applications, and so forth.States such as Michigan, however, have not been so fastidious, as the GAI report and the Drill Down hosts explain. \"We always talk about this because this continues to be a problem in  states that are poised to matter,\" says co-host Eric Eggers. \"In Michigan, we're seeing the number of counties with voter registration rates over 100 percent.\"Eggers wrote a book in 2018 called FRAUD that detailed many of the different types of election rigging and fixing that have taken place in U.S. history. That book, however, was published two years before the 2020 COVID pandemic, and rule changes made by some states that were ostensibly to make voting safer during the pandemic had the effect of making election security much harder to ensure.GAI's report covers how those rule changes, which many states have since been repealed or replaced, may have affected the 2020 outcome and threaten the integrity of the 2024 presidential election.\"We're now seeing 53 counties in Michigan with more than 100% registration, which obviously means there are some names on there that don't belong there,\" Eggers says. He notes this isn't always the fault of local or state election officials. Technically, it is the voter's responsibility to call up their previous state's registrar and ask to be removed from their voter rolls. \"The book I wrote in 2018 came about because of a report  did that focused on duplication in voter rolls. We found more than two thousand instances of double voting in 2016 in Florida alone.\" That report from 2017 is available on GAI's website here.GAI's new report explains how those rule changes, which in many states have since been repealed or replaced, may have affected the 2020 outcome and threaten the integrity of the 2024 presidential election.

    "title": "Trump DeFi project's token sale bombs harder than Joker sequel",
    "content": "Donald Trump's first-ever token sale proved a major bust while opponent Kamala Harris is trying to sell her 'crypto' advocacy to black voters ahead of November's U.S. presidential election.October 15 brought the initial token sale of the Trump-aligned World Liberty Financial (WLF) decentralized finance (DeFi) project. The day before, the WLF team conducted an 'X' Spaces event in which they claimed that more than 100,000 accredited (aka deep-pocketed) investors had been 'whitelisted' to participate in the sale of the WLFI 'governance' token.Trump himself pimped the token sale via his personal X account over the weekend, calling it \"YOUR chance to help shape the future of finance.\" Possibly, but it's primarily YOUR chance to help shape the future of Donald's finances, given the generous allocation of WLFI tokens his family is slated to control.But on the big day, the WLF website repeatedly crashed once the sale got underway, finally appearing to crash for good about an hour into the process. By that point, around 2,900 individual wallets had purchased over 330 million WLFI at a rate of 1.5¢ per token for a total haul of around $5.5 million worth of ETH, USDT and USDC.As the outage dragged on, the WLF official X account failed to offer a single word of explanation as to what happened, what they were doing to remedy it, or when the sale might resume. Equally silent were the X accounts of the Trump offspring -- sons Don Jr., Eric and Barron -- whose photos are on the WLF executive roster as 'Web3 Ambassadors.'The site finally came back online by mid-afternoon, but by 10pm EST, the total number of tokens sold was under 700 million, leaving just under 19.3 billion tokens unclaimed. The total dollar value raised was only around $10 million, a tiny sliver of the $300 million the WLF hype machine claimed it expected to raise.The poor showing appears to have finally shocked the Trumps out of their lethargy, as Donald's X account posted a video on Tuesday evening urging people to \"Get your $WLFI tokens now.\" The full court grift followed with Don Jr. saying \"LETS GO!!!\" while Eric chimed in with \"Everyone ready!?\" Evidently not.Coming just three weeks before November's vote, the token sale gave off two very distinct vibes. First, that Donald is worried that he might lose this nailbiter, so he's grifting like there's (literally) no tomorrow. Second, it was intended as a way for foreign interests to funnel cash to Donald's campaign in violation of campaign finance rules and curry some favor with the potential next leader of the formerly free world.The WLF website notes that \"Donald J. Trump and his family members ... will be entitled to receive significant fees for services provided to World Liberty Financial, which amount cannot yet be determined.\" Also to be determined: exactly what -- if anything -- the Trumps have to do to receive these 'significant fees' beyond pimp the project to the same rubes who bought all the other Trump-branded kitsch (sneakers, watches, Bibles, his multiple series of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), etc.).Speaking of, Gizmodo recently reported that scammers are flocking to Trump's Truth Social platform because the site \"seems to be a target-rich environment for people who are easy to con.\" Ahem.The 'this is fine' printThe WLF team's other big Monday announcement was the appointment of Paxos co-founder Rich Teo as head of WLF's stablecoin operations, whatever they are, because WLF still won't definitively state what their project actually does. We're a couple months into this thing and we're still no clearer on what this transmogrifying wonder-box is supposed to do beyond disappoint.WLF's 'Gold Paper' -- like a white paper but thematically gilded -- states that WLF's 'mission' is to \"democratize access to financial opportunities while fortifying the global status of the US Dollar.\" This will be accomplished by \"supporting US dollar-based stablecoins and DeFi applications that seek to preserve the US Dollar's status.\"However, WLF's primary purpose appears to be little more than serving as an educational hub providing users with \"information about and access to certain third-party DeFi applications.\" This dovetails with the WLF-affiliated trademark applications that were filed this summer, two of which were based on \"providing financial information\" in the fields of 'cryptocurrency' and 'DeFi.'It certainly sounds like WLF will happily promote other operators' DeFi platforms while conveniently disavowing any legal responsibility for whatever happens next. So, basically, the Trump University boondoggle with even less accountability. Will they take a cut of the proceeds derived from these third-party transactions? Is WLF simply a glorified affiliate marketing site?There is currently a \"temperature check proposal to launch an Aave V3 instance for WLF.\" The proposal for accessing the Ethereum-based Aave's decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol would allow WLF users to deposit USDC, USDT, ETH and WBTC, which would serve as collateral to borrow similar assets.But with the token sale a bust and Trump's historic aversion to anything remotely related to the word 'loser,' how much longer might Trump want to be publicly associated with WLF?There is one obvious reason for Trump sticking with WLF. The Gold Paper also revealed that DT Marks DEFI LLC, \"agreed to use reasonable efforts to request the owners and principals of DT Marks DEFI LLC, including Donald Trump, to promote the WLF and the WLF Protocol from time to time.\" So Trump doesn't have to do anything, merely entertain 'requests' to shill for WLF now and then.Trump will also allow WLF to use his name and AI-generated-none-more-manly illustrations of himself in their promotional material. In exchange, \"DT Marks DEFI LLC will receive 22.5 billion $WLFI tokens and a right to receive 75% of the net protocol revenues as defined in the services agreement after deduction of agreed operating expenses and the initial treasury reserve.\"Harris bets on blackMeanwhile, Trump's opponent, Kamala Harris, made her most explicit crypto policy pledge to date in an October 14th document detailing her campaign's efforts to shore up voting support among black males. Titled Vice President Harris Will Deliver for Black Men, the document lays out a five-point 'opportunity agenda' that includes: \"Supporting a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency and other digital assets so Black men who invest in and own these assets are protected.\"The document expands on this point thusly: \"More than 20% of Black Americans own or have owned cryptocurrency assets. Vice President Harris appreciates the ways in which new technologies can broaden access to banking and financial services. She will make sure owners of and investors in digital assets benefit from a regulatory framework so that Black men and others who participate in this market are protected.\"Critics have pointed out that this language is open to interpretation regarding how strict or lenient any Harris-dictated regulatory framework might prove. And in a subsequent speech focused on this 'Black men' agenda, Harris offered no further details on her digital asset policies. In fact, she didn't so much as reference digital assets by name.Speaking on Monday's WLF Spaces event, the reliably animated Don Jr. referenced Harris having allegedly \"adopted this pro-crypto policy.\" But Junior said he \"hopes everyone understands that that's going to be a lie like everything else ... The Crypto Bros and Crypto Girls gotta get out there and understand exactly what's going on.\" Sure, Junior... Hey, maybe you should start an educational website to get this message across?It matters littleOn October 14, Galaxy Research, an offshoot of Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital (NASDAQ: BRPHF) financial services firm, released a 'policy scorecard' detailing how Trump, Harris and current U.S. President Joe Biden differ on various issues affecting the digital asset sector.We'll spare you the eyestrain of reading some extremely tiny type by condensing the findings into eight words: Harris better than Biden, Trump better than Harris. Oh, and while there's \"limited\" downside risk to a Harris victory, there's an \"explosive upside possible\" if Trump gets a second term. (We don't think that phrase refers to projectile vomiting, but who's to say?)Wall Street analysts have their own views, with Bernstein issuing a note this week saying recent spikes in the fiat value of prominent tokens reflect market sentiment that Trump may get a second term. Last week, JPMorgan (NASDAQ: JPM) analysts suggested a Trump win may already be priced in, although a brief spate of irrational exuberance will undoubtedly send BTC soaring should Trump manage a victory that doesn't require angry mobs storming the Capitol.It's not a lie if you believe itMeanwhile, the battle to control this race's narrative shows no sign of letting up. Trump has seen his odds of victory surge on the PolyMarket prediction betting site since the month began, going from a dead heat to Trump holding a commanding 58-42 lead as of October 15.But as previously noted, Trump's PolyMarket rise appears to be based on one deep-pocketed bettor throwing their financial weight behind the GOP candidate. 'Fredi9999' had already acquired roughly seven million shares by early last week, but this number has since more than doubled to over 15 million and is increasing by the hour.Since Fredi9999 has also acquired millions of shares in markets that Trump is unlikely to win -- like the popular vote, something Trump failed to do in both his previous attempts -- it suggests Fredi9999 is more interested in maintaining the public perception that Trump is in the lead, rather than reflect any deep-seated belief.It's worth noting that Fredi9999 has been wrong before, like when he acquired over 14 million shares on a bet that Florida Gov. Ron Desantis would win the 2024 Presidential election. Not for nothing, but Trump's new bestest buddy Elon Musk was a Desantis supporter during the GOP presidential primary campaign.Musk declared earlier this month that prediction markets are \"more accurate than polls, as actual money is on the line.\" Musk, the richest man in the world, appears keen to convince the wider public -- including poll-obsessed media outlets -- that news of Trump's PolyMarket surge should be echoed far and wide. Draw your own conclusions.Congress ain't done yetFinally, Congressional crypto supporters still haven't given up on passing some kind of digital asset legislation in the lame-duck session that follows November's vote. Last week, Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-TN) released a 'discussion draft' of legislation intended to establish \"a clear regulatory framework for the regulation and supervision of stablecoin issuers.\"In a statement, Hagerty acknowledged that his draft \"builds upon the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act\" sponsored by Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC) in the House of Representatives. That bill was approved by the House Financial Services Committee but has yet to come up for a floor vote. Hagerty's bill would compete with the Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act of 2024, which debuted in the Senate this spring but failed to make it out of committee.In a Financial Services Committee hearing last month, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) called for a \"grand bargain\" on stablecoin legislation. Waters, who helped McHenry tinker with the House bill, stated that she hoped to strike such a bargain before the year was through despite several unresolved issues -- including who would have oversight of stablecoin issuers: the federal government or state-level regulators.The Lummis-Gillibrand bill required state-regulated stablecoin issuers to begin a 'transition' to federal oversight once their coin's market cap passes $9 billion and to complete that transition once the cap passes $10 billion.Hagerty's bill claims to \"strengthen the state pathway to stablecoin issuance\" via a clause that allows an issuer whose market cap exceeds $10 billion to ask for a federal waiver \"to remain under a State-level regulatory regime,\" with these waivers subject to annual renewal by the Fed.While hope springs eternal, Rep. John Curtis (R-UT) warned last week that bipartisan support for crypto legislation remains \"very fragile.\" Trump has attempted to claim the mantle of 'crypto president,' but Curtis said that if 'crypto' \"becomes a partisan issue, we will have a very, very difficult time\" approving any digital asset legislation.Watch IPv6 & Blockchain: Pioneering the next digital revolution",

    "title": "'Worst for a GOP candidate this century': Babe wake up, Donald Trump is doing 6 points worse than he did 4 years ago with a key demographic",
    "content": "Donald Trump is losing a valuable voter demographic, but it's hardly a surprise.Donald Trump faces a tough challenge this November, with voters already heading to polls to participate in the 2024 presidential election. And going up against the lively and frequently-memed Kamala Harris instead of a declining Joe Biden makes securing one key demographic that much harder.Current data indicates that Trump is cratering with white women, doing six points worse in Oct. 2024 than he was in Nov. 2020. CNN's senior data reported Harry Enten explained that Trump's margin had fallen from seven points to one, pointing to increased Harris support from that demographic.One might not assume this camp is of the utmost importance to Trump, given all the groping accusations made against him and his documented misogyny. Conversely, it's an invaluable group for his campaign. He still leads in the demographic by a single point, but the advantage is waning rapidly with three weeks to go.47 percent of white women voted for Trump in 2016, compared to 45 for Clinton according to the Pew Research Center. They were significantly more pro-Trump than non-white women, with the overall tally from all women said to be 39 percent in his favor. Therefore, white women accounted for a solid chunk of his election-winning votes.CNN also broke down white women's likely share of votes in the election: white women make up 36 percent, white men 34, women of color 16, and men of color 15. \"White women make up the plurality of the electorate,\" Enten noted.\"When we're talking about five, six seven, point shifts in Kamala Harris' direction we're talking about a major part of the electorate, and that can actually move the overall electorate more than ginormous shift among a considerably smaller part of the electorate,\" he continued, referring Trump's gains with black men and women.Reasons for the 2024 change in the tide could come down to several factors. Trump's many alleged sexual assaults were public in 2016 when he won the election, so the fallout of recent threats against safe and legal abortion in some states as well as Harris being a female candidate are increasing factors.The report also tapped into how abortion is a top voting issue in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, where over 80 percent of voters are white. On average 27 percent of women in these states said abortion was their top voting issue, as opposed to 7 percent of men.\"I think what we're talking about here is after Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, white women in the suburban areas, in these key battleground states, have very much turned against Republicans,\" Enten concluded. One could also argue that Harris appeals to moderate swing voters, being someone whose politics and career have leaned towards centrismThese numbers come at a difficult time for Trump, who on Oct. 14 went viral for a strange Pennsylvania rally where he appeared out of sorts, awkwardly dancing to music on stage for nearly half an hour while onlookers stood by confused. Should he continue to draw concern in key states, who knows how many more points he'll drop?",

Law enforcement sources told WJLA that election day three weeks away is a big factor this year, and officials are concerned that the period between Election Day and Inauguration Day could be extraordinarily tense.MPD is considering going to what's called Alpha Bravo 12-hour days starting before the election and continuing through inauguration day.

Democrats have accused Republicans of trying to introduce a flurry of new rules to delay and confuse the count process in what is a crucial swing state in the presidential election. Early voting began in Georgia on Tuesday.Newsweek sought email comment from the Georgia State Election Board on Wednesday.McBurney noted that the rule initially looks like a good idea, but it will lead to confusion. He granted an injunction preventing the enforcement of the rule, and quoted Kavanaugh, who was appointed to the Supreme Court by former President Donald Trump.In his concurring decision in 2022 in the case of Merrill v. Milligan, Kavanaugh had noted that hand-counting each ballot was too arduous for election workers and could lead to chaos.\"State and local election officials need substantial time to plan for elections. Running elections statewide is extraordinarily complicated and difficult,\" Kavanaugh wrote at the time.\"Those elections require enormous advance preparations by state and local officials and pose significant logistic challenges,\" Kavanaugh added. \" would require heroic efforts by those state and local authorities in the next few weeks -- and even heroic efforts likely would not be enough to avoid chaos and confusion.\"In Merrill v. Milligan, the Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiffs demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success on their claim that an Alabama districting plan violated the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits racial discrimination.McBurney, a Fulton County Superior Court judge, used Kavanaugh's opinion on Tuesday to grant an injunction to the election board in Cobb County, in Atlanta's suburbs.The Cobb County board said that the hand-count rule would disrupt the 2024 presidential election.In Tuesday's ruling, McBurney wrote that the hand count rule \"is too much, too late\" and granted the temporary injunction while he considers the issue further.Gabe Sterling of the Georgia secretary of state's office wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday that more than 328,000 ballots were cast on Tuesday. The previous first-day record was 136,000 in 2020, Sterling added.The Georgia government website, Georgia.gov, says that any registered voter may cast an early ballot.It adds that early voting \"can help Georgia voters avoid crowds or find a time to vote that's better for their schedules in the weeks prior to Election Day.\"",

    "title": "The Chisholm Trail: Spelman College Screens Chisholm '72: Unbought & Unbossed",
    "content": "On Tuesday, Oct. 15, Spelman College hosted a screening of Chisholm '72: Unbought & Unbossed, a documentary chronicling Shirley Chisholm's 1972 campaign as the first Black woman to run for president of the United States. The screening took place on campus in the Camille Olivia Hanks Cosby Ed.D. Auditorium.This screening aligns with the 2024 presidential election currently featuring Kamala Harris, the first female and African American Vice President, who is the current Democratic presidential nominee.\"Looking for a road to freedom, take the Chisholm trail.\" These lyrics were sung by Jesse Jackson's Operation PUSH Choir during Shirley Chisholm's history-making run for President of the United States. The phrase \"Chisholm Trail\" is a clever play on words, connecting Shirley Chisholm's name with the historic cattle-driving route used in the post-Civil War era. Just as that trail symbolized progress and opportunity, Chisholm's presidential run carved a new path in the post-Civil Rights era, inspiring generations to pursue political freedom and representation, a message particularly relevant as the 2024 election approaches.The documentary, opened with a rap ad from the \"Rock the Vote\" campaign, aimed at encouraging youth involvement in politics. From there, it moved to Chisholm's 1972 announcement of her candidacy for president, setting the tone for the film's exploration of her groundbreaking campaign. Chisholm was not only the first Black woman to run for the highest office in the nation, but she also broke new ground as an African American in U.S. politics.The film, which runs 1 hour and 17 minutes, provides a rich look at Chisholm's life, including her family's move from Barbados to New York and her rise in political advocacy. It also features testimonials from key figures in her life, such as Victor L. Robles, her ex-husband Conrad Chisholm, Octavia Butler, Reverend Walter Fauntroy, and Bobby Seale.Following the screening, a panel discussion was held featuring the film's director, Shola Lynch, who made her directorial debut with this documentary in 2004, and is now the Diana King Endowed Professor at Spelman College. Joining her was Dr. Ayoka Chenzira, Professor Emerita of Art and Visual Culture at Spelman. The two engaged in a thoughtful conversation about Chisholm's legacy and the impact her candidacy had on future generations of women and people of color in politics.\"If I couldn't see her, how would the rest of the world see her?\" Lynch recalled, referring to the lack of media coverage around Chisholm's run. \"The news didn't cover her run for president because nobody thought that she would win.\" Lynch also spoke about the research process behind the documentary. \"It's not a documentary if you don't do research,\" she said, remarking on the importance of digging into archives, especially for Black history, which is often under-documented. \"Even in the film, the best footage was taken by two students who talked Chisholm into letting them follow her around.\"The discussion was opened up to audience questions, allowing attendees to reflect on their personal connections to Chisholm's legacy and how her story resonates today. During the Q&A session, Lynch reflected on how history is much like a relay race, with each generation building on the last. \"We wouldn't be here today if it weren't for Shirley Chisholm, and I wish she was around to see it,\" Lynch said. She noted that Chisholm was not the only trailblazer, mentioning others like Jesse Jackson and Barack Obama, whose campaigns furthered the legacy Chisholm helped create.Lynch also challenged the audience to think about their own activism. \"If you're a political person, if you're an activist, if you believe in justice, how is that part of your life every day?\" Lynch asked, urging everyone to reflect on how they can honor the work of leaders like Chisholm by actively participating in shaping the future of political freedom and representation.As Chisholm stated in the documentary, \"I want to be remembered as a woman who fought for change in the 20th century.\" Her legacy, evident in the 2024 election and beyond, knowingly, or unknowingly continues to inspire and encourage a new generation of political activists and leaders.",

    "content": "The current Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris has often been subjected to questions regarding her ethnicity and background. Born on October 20, 1964, in Oakland California, Harris is the daughter of immigrants.But is she Indian? That is one question that has lingered across the mind of many voters ahead of the 2024 US presidential election where she is running against former US president and Republican nominee Donald Trump.Harris' mother Shyamala Gopalan was from India, while her father Donald Harris is of Jamaican descent.Kamal Harris' Indian HeritageHarris' Indian roots come from her mother, who was born in Chennai, India.Shyamala Gopalan was a renowned breast cancer researcher and civil rights activist. She immigrated to the US in the 1960s to pursue her education and career.Harris has frequently spoken about the influence her mother had on her life, speaking about the values of hard work, education, and social justice.In interviews, Harris has highlighted her Indian heritage, expressing pride in her mother's cultural background.She has shared stories of her childhood, including experiences with Indian cuisine and traditions, which shaped her identity.In a recent interview, while talking about her mom, Harris said: \"I realised she was actually teaching me to think about where you had agency in that moment and think about what you had the choice to do or not to do.\"\"As a young girl visiting my grandparents in India, my grandfather took me on his morning walks, where he would discuss the importance of fighting for equality and fighting corruption. He was a retired civil servant who had been part of the movement to win India's independence,\" Harris had said.Harris visited IndiaSoon after Harris stepped into the Presidential race, most people in a town in Tamil Nadu named Thulasendrapuram started praying every day for her win.Thulasendrapuram is said to be Harris' ancestral village, where her maternal grandfather P V Gopalan lived some 100 years ago.As per a report by Reuters, Harris was born and raised in California but visited Thulasendrapuram when she was five.Harris' Jamaican rootsHarris' father, Donald Harris, is a Jamaican national who moved to the US to study at Stanford University. He has had a successful career as an economics professor.His Jamaican roots also play a significant role in Harris's identity, contributing to her multicultural background.Identity & representationHarris' mixed heritage makes her a unique figure in American politics. As the first female Vice President, and the first of Black and South Asian descent, she represents a diverse America.Harris often discusses the importance of representation and inclusivity, echoing the sentiments of her upbringing.Is Kamala Harris Indian?Yes, she is of Indian descent through her mother, Shyamala Gopalan. However, her identity is multifaceted, encompassing her Jamaican heritage as well.",

    "title": "Sebastian Stan said that what he uncovered while playing Donald Trump in 'The Apprentice' was 'tragic'",
    "content": "\"I was fascinated to see what has happened to this man,\" Stan told Yahoo Entertainment.Many actors have portrayed Donald Trump onscreen over the years, from Alec Baldwin to Brendan Gleeson. Sebastian Stan wanted his turn to be different.When Stan was tapped for the lead role in The Apprentice, a movie that follows the then real estate mogul's friendship with notorious lawyer Roy Cohn, he did his own research. He read countless interviews and watched as much footage of Trump from the '70s and '80s as possible, listening to him \"nonstop\" and \"getting that into  bloodstream.\"Stan told Yahoo Entertainment that immersing himself in Trump's early life revealed a side of him many might not expect to see as we're \"inundated\" by media coverage of the former president, who is running for reelection.\"Looking back on some of those earlier interviews with him when he was really young and trying to get tax abatements to  the Grand Hyatt, there was something ... pure and honest, and there was great potential that I saw in that person at that time,\" he said. \"I was fascinated to see what has happened to this man.\"Stan said that under Cohn's guidance, Trump became more \"brutal.\"\"The loss of empathy and humanity, I think, was really tragic,\" he added.The Apprentice was written by Gabriel Sherman, a reporter who covered Trump's life extensively before the presidency. Stan's impression evolves as Trump gets older, taking on the voice, mannerisms, appearance and speech patterns that the former president is now known for.\"As the success kept growing, so did the persona and the brand that he was building,\" Stan said. \"I find all of this stuff to be a shtick at the end of the day, and I would actually argue that it's more conscious than subconscious on his part.\"The changes, at first, are subtle scene by scene -- until at the end of the movie, when Trump is shown repeating Cohn's three \"rules of winning,\" sounding more like his former mentor than the Trump seen at the beginning of the film.Stan said he worked with director Ali Abbasi to trace Trump's evolution in a way that is \"digestible to an audience that already was coming into the theater with a lot of impressions and projections.\"Abbasi, an Iranian-Danish filmmaker, didn't know much about Trump until he went viral for slowly descending on an escalator in front of a crowd before announcing he was running for president in 2015.Abbasi told Yahoo Entertainment that bringing an outsider's perspective to a story about the Republican presidential nominee was both a strength and a weakness.\"It's probably not a good thing to fetishize some of these things too much, you know?\" Abbasi said. \"I think we approach this era and these characters with a lack of reverence or respect, which gave the movie its edge or its rawness.\"He might not have picked up on the significance of certain clubs Trump frequented, but he wanted to look at the story \"more as an anthropologist\" who looks at characters \"in bigger context\" rather than judging things as high- or lowbrow.Stan said he felt like the opportunity to play Trump was \"something that I guess I couldn't ignore, ultimately,\" though he was nervous about it at first. He was drawn to working with Abbasi as the \"captain of the ship\" because he offers a unique point of view as someone who lives abroad.\"Sometimes we need to look at the people that are looking down at us ... to help us get perspective of what's happening in the trenches,\" Stan said.Trump's lawyers filed a cease and desist letter against the movie after its Cannes Film Festival premiere in May, calling it a \"malicious defamation\" that \"should not see the light of day.\" Following the film's Oct. 11 theatrical release, Trump condemned the movie in a Truth Social post as a \"cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election.\" In response, Abbasi wrote in an X post that he was \"available to talk further.\"Abbasi told Yahoo Entertainment that he didn't think the film would be so controversial -- in his eyes, it's \"raw but balanced.\"\" did a really beautiful job of fact-checking and rigorous journalistic work,\" he said. \"When we worked on the script together, there wasn't a moment where I thought, 'This is ... a dirty secret that nobody knew!' It was well researched and the sources were out in the open. There's nothing here that you can't find with one Google search.\"I wasn't naive about  being a divisive figure, but I was maybe a bit naive about how the rest of the world would embrace that and how the corporate structure in Hollywood would want to jump on the opportunity,\" he said.After Trump's legal threat, the film struggled to find a distributor. Its first week in theaters only generated $1.6 million at the box office, but Abbasi wasn't bothered.\"More people went in to watch #TheApprentice in a weekend than a whole week of Trump rallies!\" Abbasi posted on X.",

    "title": "Trump Cult Crazies Blame Hurricanes On 'Weather Control' -- And Defame FEMA",
    "content": "Chances are quite good that yet another major hurricane will come ashore in the United States some time before the 2024 presidential election is decided, and that it will afflict mainly Republican areas of the country. And if that should happen, large parts of the country will go even crazier than they already are.And that is seriously crazy. Barking mad.No particular expertise is required to see how these things could happen. We're still in the midst of hurricane season, after all, and 2024 has been a particularly active one so far. Also, if you glance at a map, Southern coastal regions is where Republicans live. Damn few Democratic strongholds in the gulf states.Houston, New Orleans, that's about it. You'd think even a dunce like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) could figure that out.But no, the Georgia Republican thinks it's all a big conspiracy. She professes to believe that \"they\" control the weather. \"They\" presumably being the same mysterious cabal responsible for \"Jewish space lasers\" that caused massive wildfires in California a while back.What's more she has lots of company. Writing in The Atlantic, Charlie Warzel documented how crackpot conspiracy theories swept the internet. \"Infowars'\" Alex Jones alleged that Hurricanes Helene and Milton were \"weather weapons\" deployed against American patriots by the U.S. government, i.e. the Biden administration.\"Scrolling through these platforms,\" Warzel wrote \"watching them fill with false information, harebrained theories, and doctored images -- all while panicked residents boarded up their houses, struggled to evacuate, and prayed that their worldly possessions wouldn't be obliterated overnight -- offered a portrait of American discourse almost too bleak to reckon with head-on.\"Remember when Vice President Al Gore used to carry on about \"the information superhighway\" that was going to usher in a new age of enlightenment? Well, that's not what happened.Instead of roadside shacks at the edge of town housing palm readers, tarot card mavens, horoscope experts and other solitary purveyors of mystical mumbo jumbo and superstition, we now have websites peddling delusional nonsense to thousands. Sheer folly has gotten organized.And the politicians are not far behind. Donald Trump, J.D. Vance, and Fox News have all peddled the lie that FEMA (the Federal Emergency Management Administration) is offering only one-time payments of $750 to homeowners who have lost their property due to the hurricanes, and that the money must be repaid.None of that is true. Republican governors in the affected states have been unanimous in praising the federal response.Elon Musk, owner of X, claimed -- utterly without evidence, because it's also absolutely false -- that FEMA was \"actively blocking shipments and seizing goods and services locally and locking them away...It's very real and scary how much they have taken control to stop people helping.\"Musk's post has been read a reported 40 million times.If the United States is going to deport immigrants, maybe we should ship him back to South Africa.Anyway, in consequence of Musk and Trump's lies, crazy people have been harassing and threatening to shoot FEMA workers trying to deliver life-saving supplies to hurricane victims. Other idiots are threatening to kill TV meteorologists for debunking \"weaponized weather\" fables.It's enough to make a newspaper columnist feel superfluous. I used to get death threats all the time. Haven't had one for months now. Perhaps I should become an \"influencer.\"Anyway, hurricane or no hurricane, when and by whom will the 2024 election be decided? It's not necessary to use your Marjorie Taylor Greene magic decoder ring to understand that the signs and portents aren't good. Is there any chance that candidate Trump would concede defeat? I would say that there is no chance at all.The man has been visibly \"decompensating,\" as psychologists say, for months now. During his increasingly chaotic \"rallies,\" Trump can scarcely keep a coherent thought in his head. It's all sharks, Hannibal Lecter, and name-calling Kamala Harris now. At an appearance near Philadelphia the other night, he quit talking and stood listening to recorded music for fully forty minutes. Just stood there.That's a long damn time. Members of the Trump Cult pretended it was a genius stroke, because that's what cults do. There is pretty much no behavior so bizarre that it can't be rationalized as an expression of sheer genius. Adepts surrender to reality quietly, and one at a time. Meanwhile, Trump is much more far gone than Joe Biden at his most confused.That doesn't mean Trump can't try to incite an insurrection if he loses come November 5. But it surely means the effort would fail. But what do I know? I'm one of those \"radical left lunatics\" the great man blames for betraying America. An elitist. A guy who believes what the National Weather Service tells him.",

    "content": "Good morning. It is Wednesday, Oct. 16 -- slightly less than three weeks until the polls close on the 2024 presidential election. Here's what's happening in Opinion.I saw Alex Garland's \"Civil War\" on Max this weekend. And though it's a well-done film, I don't recommend watching it right now. The story line of Americans slaughtering each other because of where they are from or their political affiliation strikes a little too close to home.After Jan. 6, 2021, I no longer find it difficult to imagine a future in which the United States has disintegrated into warring tribes, and the president has refused to leave office after two terms and has ordered airstrikes on U.S. citizens. (Although I still don't buy the California/Texas alliance.)And things aren't looking better for this next transition as the actual and rhetorical violence during this presidential election is unprecedented, at least in my lifetime. As much as I want this election to be over, I'm afraid of what comes next.If Vice President Kamala Harris wins, will Trump voters riot again? If former President Trump wins, will the violent element among his base feel empowered to act out against their political enemies? Some of them already feel comfortable enough to fly their fascist (swastika) flags at his rallies.You know who also seems to be expecting pandemonium? Trump, who told Fox News on Sunday that he's worried about election day violence from \"radical left lunatics\" and that the National Guard or U.S. military should be deployed against the \"enemy from within.\" Who are these radicals, exactly? Trump only mentioned one person -- mild-mannered Burbank Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff, who is running for U.S. Senate. Clearly Trump is already setting up the alternative narrative should his well-armed superfans act out violently again, if their candidate loses again.Gen. Mark Milley is right: Trump proved himself unfit to be commander in chief. And if he gets a second term, the former president is bound to \"deploy the military as a political prop in service of his own brand, as he already tried to do. And he would reshape the military and the national security apparatus so that Trumpists would rise and others would not, \" writes U.S. Army veteran ML Cavanaugh.The GOP assault on election integrity has already begun. Republicans are filing lawsuits and challenges to local election rules, targeting mail-in ballots, drop boxes and most every measure to make it easier for people to vote. \"Since 2020, red states have enacted voting restrictions under the guise of 'election integrity,' though fraud is all but nonexistent,\" writes columnist Jackie Calmes.If you're rethinking going to college, think again. Education journalist Jay Mathews worries that the trend toward college alternatives \"may push high school too far in a new direction -- awarding diplomas for off-campus apprenticeships, for spending too little time on homework and too much on gaining work and resume experience, or for minimal vocational ed -- risking students' foundation in literature, history, writing, math and languages.\"The complete list of The Times' electoral endorsements. The editorial board has finished making recommendations for the Nov. 5 election, including state, city and county propositions, the L.A. County judicial races and Los Angeles Community College District Board. The board also made endorsements in L.A. City Council, L.A.

    "content": "Judge Robert McBurney appeared to choose Kavanaugh's words to counter any Republican challenge to the Supreme Court.The Republican-led Georgia State Election Board introduced a rule in September that three election workers must each count all the presidential ballots by hand. Democrats have accused Republicans of trying to introduce a flurry of new rules to delay and confuse the count process in what is a crucial swing state in the presidential election. Early voting began in Georgia on Tuesday.Newsweek sought email comment from the Georgia State Election Board on Wednesday.McBurney noted that the rule initially looks like a good idea, but it will lead to confusion. He granted an injunction preventing the enforcement of the rule, and quoted Kavanaugh, who was appointed to the Supreme Court by former President Donald Trump.In his concurring decision in 2022 in the case of Merrill v. Milligan, Kavanaugh had noted that hand-counting each ballot was too arduous for election workers and could lead to chaos.\"State and local election officials need substantial time to plan for elections. Running elections statewide is extraordinarily complicated and difficult,\" Kavanaugh wrote at the time.\"Those elections require enormous advance preparations by state and local officials and pose significant logistic challenges,\" Kavanaugh added. \" would require heroic efforts by those state and local authorities in the next few weeks -- and even heroic efforts likely would not be enough to avoid chaos and confusion.\"In Merrill v. Milligan, the Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiffs demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success on their claim that an Alabama districting plan violated the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits racial discrimination.McBurney, a Fulton County Superior Court judge, used Kavanaugh's opinion on Tuesday to grant an injunction to the election board in Cobb County, in Atlanta's suburbs.The Cobb County board said that the hand-count rule would disrupt the 2024 presidential election.In Tuesday's ruling, McBurney wrote that the hand count rule \"is too much, too late\" and granted the temporary injunction while he considers the issue further.Gabe Sterling of the Georgia secretary of state's office wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday that more than 328,000 ballots were cast on Tuesday. The previous first-day record was 136,000 in 2020, Sterling added.The Georgia government website, Georgia.gov, says that any registered voter may cast an early ballot.It adds that early voting \"can help Georgia voters avoid crowds or find a time to vote that's better for their schedules in the weeks prior to Election Day.\"",

    "content": "Analysts are warning of a potential Bitcoin price correction as open interest in futures markets climbs to new highs for 2024, while trading volumes remain subdued.Experts have suggested that the imbalance between rising leverage and declining activity could create conditions for sudden price reversals if traders begin closing long positions.\"Open interest has reached a new peak for the year, and funding rates are at their highest since June,\" Illia Otychenko, Lead Analyst at CEX.IO told Decrypt. \"But the troubling part is the downtrend in volume. This means fewer traders are actively participating, but those that remain are heavily leveraged. The market is becoming fragile, and any loss of momentum could trigger a swift correction.\"Bitcoin experienced sharp swings overnight, reaching a high of $67,922 before dropping to $65,160 in less than an hour. This volatility wiped out $302.25 million in leveraged positions, with $185.9 million in long positions liquidated as the price fell, according to data from CoinGlass.Bitcoin has since rebounded slightly, trading at $67,120 during European hours, TradingView data shows.Otychenko noted that the mismatch between open interest and volume makes Bitcoin's market highly sensitive to any abrupt shifts in sentiment.\"A drop in volume while leverage rises is a red flag -- it creates an environment where even small price changes can spark liquidation cascades. If traders start locking in profits, especially on long positions, the market could unravel quickly,\" he explained.Technical indicators further support the caution. Bitcoin is testing resistance at $68,000, a level it has struggled to break through. The asset is also approaching the upper boundary of the Bollinger Bands, signaling a potential pullback. Indicators like the RSI and MACD are showing bearish divergences, hinting that the current rally might lack the momentum to sustain further upward movement.RSI (Relative Strength Index) measures the speed and change of price movements to indicate whether an asset is overbought or oversold, while MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) tracks momentum and trend changes by comparing moving averages to signal potential reversals.In a note sent to Decrypt, Valentin Fournier, an analyst at BRN, highlighted the importance of institutional flows in the market's recent behavior.\"Institutional support remains strong, with $371 million in ETF inflows yesterday,\" Fournier said. \"The Fear and Greed Index has risen to 73, reflecting growing confidence among market participants.

    "title": "Climate Change Action Depends on the 2024 Election",
    "content": "Wildfires that forced thousands to evacuate and destroyed hundreds of homes and other structures; heat waves that smothered the Southwest in sweltering, deadly heat for weeks on end; and hurricanes that have wrought catastrophic damage, nearly wiping away whole towns -- these are just a few of the climate-change-fueled disasters that have taken hundreds of lives in the U.S. so far this year. Conservatively, such disasters cost the country $150 billion annually, and that is with just 1.1 degrees Celsius of warming since preindustrial times. No part of the country is immune to the effects.Climate scientists are in clear agreement that in order to avoid ever-worsening disasters and disruptions to our societies, the world must rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The policies put in place over the next few years will determine what the future climate looks like and what threats the world will face. The U.S. is crucial to this effort. And in the 2024 presidential election contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump, voters have a choice between diametrically opposed visions of what the country must do. \"When it comes to climate change, the contrast between Trump and Harris could not be more stark,\" says Leah Stokes, a University of California, Santa Barbara, political scientist who focuses on energy and climate.Over the past four years, the Biden-Harris administration has taken by far the most action to address the climate crisis of any U.S. presidential administration -- primarily through enacting the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), for which Harris cast the tiebreaking vote. The administration has also strengthened many environmental regulations and made environmental justice a key goal. During her speech in which she accepted the Democratic nomination for the presidential race, Harris said people in the U.S. deserve \"the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water and live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis.\"If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.Trump has stated that he wants clean air and water -- but his administration rolled back more than 200 environmental regulations. He has appointed Supreme Court justices who overturned decades of wetland protections and weakened the role of science in government policymaking. And the plans laid out under the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 (widely considered a blueprint for a second Trump administration) would seek to build on that deregulation, maximize fossil-fuel production and dismantle much of the government's climate science apparatus. Although the Trump campaign has tried to distance itself from Project 2025, many former Trump officials helped draft it. And in 2018 the Heritage Foundation trumpeted that the then-sitting Trump administration had adopted nearly two thirds of the conservative think tank's policy recommendations. Trump has also said that he would rescind unspent IRA funds and that climate change is \"not our problem.\" But the U.S. is the largest historical contributor to global warming, and abundant research shows that climate change is worsening extreme weather disasters here and elsewhere. \"Any way you slice it, it is firmly the U.S.'s problem,\" says Robbie Orvis, senior director of modeling and analysis at Energy Innovation (EI), a nonpartisan energy and climate policy think tank. \"You can't put up a wall for climate.\"Climate Policies Past and PresentBy far the biggest signature climate initiative of the Biden-Harris administration is the IRA, which pledged $369 billion in climate investments over 10 years. Adding to that are climate-related provisions in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the CHIPS and Science Act. There are also major new Environmental Protection Agency regulations that target carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, methane pollution from the oil and gas industry, and vehicle tailpipe emissions. This policy push is \"more than doubling the annual pace of emissions reductions this decade compared to the rate achieved in the 2010s,\" according to an EI report.With the added investment, tax incentives and continued declines in costs, renewable energy and battery storage have dominated new electricity generation projects in the U.S. in the last couple of years. Electric vehicle sales reached record levels in 2023. But oil and gas production have also reached record highs during both the Trump and Biden-Harris administrations, and the U.S. is the world's top natural gas exporter.It is unclear exactly where Harris stands on the question of U.S. fossil-fuel production, though she has spoken about the need for a mix of energy sources and said she no longer supports a ban on fracking. Stokes notes that Trump, on the other hand, has said that on day one, he wants to begin to \"drill, drill, drill,\" and the Washington Post reported that when meeting with oil executives this spring, Trump said he would immediately reverse a number of environmental policies if they raised $1 billion to help him get reelected. Project 2025 also calls for cutting government research into clean energy technologies and maximizing fossil-fuel extraction on federal lands.To provide a broad look at how potential policies under Harris or Trump would shape future U.S. emissions, Orvis's team at EI used its Energy Policy Simulator, an open-source computer model. The researchers compared current policies under the Biden-Harris administration with more ambitious policies that achieve a target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and with the policies laid out in Project 2025. They found that the latter scenario \"basically stops the progress that's been made,\" Orvis says. And even if current policies aren't enough to meet international climate goals, any progress that can be made is crucial because \"each tenth of a degree  is more damaging than the previous one.\"And jettisoning IRA provisions and other Biden climate policies wouldn't just impact emissions. \"We're clearly in the middle of a large manufacturing renaissance in the U.S.,\" Orvis says, and this is partly because IRA incentives made it competitive for clean energy companies to be built here. Scrapping those incentives could mean that companies would take hundreds of billions of dollars in investments -- and the jobs that come with them -- to other countries. Such action would \"permanently exclude the U.S. from being a clean energy manufacturer and exporter because the ship will have sailed in the next few years,\" Orvis says. Continued fossil-fuel extraction and use in power generation would also increase household energy costs, the EI report found.Trump's running mate, J.D. Vance, has decried the IRA and said a Trump administration would undo it. But during the recent vice presidential debate, he said tackling climate change would require bringing back \"as much American manufacturing as possible, and you'd want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America.\" But \"that is exactly what the Inflation Reduction Act is doing,\" Orvis says. \"Eliminating that would be disastrous for those industries.\"Though Harris has not laid out specific climate and energy plans, Stokes and Costa Samaras, director of the Carnegie Mellon University Scott Institute for Energy Innovation, point to her proposed policy to incentivize building more affordable housing (particularly multifamily dwellings such as apartment buildings). \"There's a lot of the greenhouse gas emissions in the economy that are wrapped up into where people live,\" Samaras says. If built nearer to urban centers or closer to public transportation routes, that could mean more people can take trains or buses to work instead of driving, for example. \"Housing policy is climate policy,\" says Samaras, who also worked for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy until this year.Disaster Preparedness and ResponseRegardless of who wins, the next president will have to deal with the consequences of climate change. Disasters such as hurricanes, floods and heat waves will continue to strike the country with increasing frequency and severity.The Biden-Harris administration has emphasized climate resilience and preparing communities to better withstand disasters, and it launched an initiative to provide states with money to improve building codes. The IRA and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law \"are also giant climate resilience laws, the biggest in history,\" Samaras says. And Harris has decried misinformation that Trump has spread around the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)'s response to Hurricanes Helene and Milton.The Project 2025 plan, in contrast, calls for slashing funding to disaster response, ending disaster preparedness grants and doing away with the National Flood Insurance Program. The latter is the only way that many people in the U.S. can afford flood insurance, which is not covered by standard homeowners' policies because private insurers fear the high risks of incurring major costs. And during his first administration, Trump refused to approve disaster aid to areas hit by California wildfires until staffers showed him that those areas had voted for him, multiple staffers told POLITICO's E&E News. Presidential budget requests made during Trump's first term also included major cuts to FEMA, including for repairing high-risk dams and creating flood maps.Project 2025 calls for stripping the National Weather Service of its forecasting duties, which would relegate it to data collection, and shifting forecasting to private companies. The plan would effectively replace a single, central warning system with a patchwork of apps and websites that users might have to pay to access. \"It's inequitable,\" Samaras says. \"It's bad science. It's going to cost people's lives.\"For climate experts like Samaras, Stokes and Orvis, the choice in this election on the climate front is clear -- because, as Samaras says, \"Every year matters. Every ton  matters. Every action matters.\"",

Even when Jesus came down to Earth, He never demanded to be worshipped.He who is God, sohumbled Himself to became man and led a humble life as He showed men, the path to salvation. But here you are, together with some self-acclaimed men and women of God, parading yourselves around as if all authority in Heaven and on earth have been given to you, to do whatever you like.Unfortunately, your conducts are rather making a mockery of Christianity, which now seems to be an avenuefor amassing of wealth and fame, instead of amassing souls to Heaven. And by your deeds, any non-Christian who has not read the Bible may think Christianity is a bad religion and Christ is fake. You are doing great injustice to Christianity and this is sinful.And when God-fearing people draw your attention to your false prophecies and your un-Christlike manners, you get mad at them and curse them. True Christians do not do that. Jesus Christ was spat upon, slapped, beaten with whips and finally nailed to the Cross, but He rather pleaded with God to forgive those who did that to Him (Luke 23:34).And Stephen also prayed for forgiveness for those who were killing him (Acts 7:60). Be very careful who you curse. You may curse someone after God's heart and consequences may not be good for you. Seriously, by your deeds are you truly a servant of Godand a follower of Christ?Personally, anddrawing from the knowledge of virtues I get from my Church, the Holy Catholic Church, I do not see the virtue of humility, the foundation of all virtues in you and those self-acclaimed servants of God, who openly attack each other with curses and display of who is more powerful.The Sacred Scriptures teaches me a lot about the true prophets of God and the false ones. The true prophets always say exactly what God tells them, \"Thus says the Lord!\" Whether palatable or not; And areready to die for saying it.The false prophets are always around the politicians, (the kings, etc.) and will always tell them what will please them (Jeremiah 23:9-40; Ezekiel 13.) From what I read about true prophets and false ones, it looks like we have in Ghana, prophets who want to be favoured by politicians and that classifiesthe lot of you,as false prophets.You lot are not doing Christianity any favour by always being divided over what you say are God's prophecies on issues, most especially on who will be the next president. How come the One and Same True God have different opinions when it comes to a simple issue like who will lead the nation?If indeed, God spoke those words, then we may havein one group,the true prophets and in another, the false ones.Over the past three years, you come out strongly with two names who will win the 2024 presidential election. First, you said God has told you that Alan Kyerematen would win both the NPP presidential primary and become our next president in 2025.Unfortunately, Alan did not contest the primary and went on to leave the NPP to run as an independent candidate in the presidential race. So, are you saying God did not know this will happen?Then, you came back to tell us that, God has chosen Mahama to win the presidential election. If this is truly a prophecy from God, then He must tell us why Mahama, since you said in 2020, that God told you, Mahama will never be president again. Or is it because NPP did not give you what you demanded; you have decided to shift to the NDC, hoping to still maintain your title and rank as presidential prophet?Or, you do not want a non-Christian to lead this country? I have to ask these questions, not because I am against Mahama winning, but you are just a confused lot. If Mahama wins, it will be through the daily prayerful intercessions by true and good Christians and non-Christians and also through his total submission to God and his personal relationship with Christ. You have no contribution in this.Now assuming Mahama does not win, what will be your caveat? You will come to say he did not do what you told him to do?So, come out clear and tell us now, what Mahama must do to win this election. So that if evidence shows that he did not do what he was instructed to do and he fails to win, we will believe your prophecy.One of your followers was on television, saying he had a vision of you in the spiritual realm, forcefully taking the sword of governance from Nana Addo. Who does he think he is deceiving? Every body knows that Nana Addo is not contesting elections and had pledged to hand-over to the one who wins the elections, so what is this about him keeping that sword? Come on, we are not children who can easily be deceived. But, why were you appointed to fight him for the sword, when you are not contesting the presidential elections? Stop these jokes.You and some of the prophets are on television prophesying bloody conflicts during and after the 2024 Elections. We have heard all this before. No blood shed will occur during Election 2024. Personnel in our Armed Forces are for the nation and not for any politician, sothey will never allow this to happen.Now, when we come to the issue of humility, none inyour class of modern-day tele-prophets, can score even a grade \"E\". Your pride and arroganceare just too much.Remember the true servants of God and Jesus, Himself were so humble and would never make themselves important even after performing miracles.In 2 Kings 5, is a classic example of how a humble prophet of God should conduct himself. This was about Naaman the Syrian general and Prophet Elisha, who never came to meet the general, to draw attention to himself, but only send down instructions on how he can be healed.And there are occasions when Jesus either directly forbade people He cured from broadcasting about Him or He simply shied away from the scene.If it were you and those others, you will throw yourself around feeling so important and demanding to be adored.Personally, I do not believe you are what you claim to be. You are an embarrassment to Christianity and you must be told this truth.In December 2018, you said God gave you a list of people who would die in 2019, which included the former first lady H.E. Theresa Kufuor, who was 83 years at that time and the National Chief Imam, Shiekh Nuhu Sharubutu who was 99 years, then.When the Muslim youth,stormed your church for further clarifications, you run to the National Chief Imam and went down on all four, like Afia Pokuaa at the Manhyia Palace, and begged for forgiveness, adding that God's prophecy was not correct and the Shiekh was no longer going to die. Either you must be very powerful to be able to halt, whatever God decides to do, or you are fake. I will settle for the latter. Prophets of old, died for proclaiming God's prophecy, but here you are declaring God never spoke well, just to save your skin. That day you made Christianity look fake and a scam.As you are aware, the former First Lady, lived on for almost five more years before departingthis life to eternal glory and the National Chief Imam is now 105 years and still very strong as God keeps blessing him every day.Some education for you, when God says to someone, he is to die, it means the person's soul will perish in hell (2 Kings 20: 1-4 and the Book of Jonah). When someone is to die and gain eternal life in Heaven, God will say, \"today, you will be with Me in Paradise.\"(Luke 23:42-43). These words from Jesus to the dying Dismas, the repentant armed robber, saved his soul.Another thing that you should be aware of, prophecies which are about someone, are to be told directly to them and not proclaimed publicly. Prophet Nathan's encounter with King David is a classic example, (2 Samuel 12:1-25). Verse 1, is clear:\"God sent Nathan to David...\" God did not send Nathan to the public square. David could have been dethroned if what he did went public. But you always go public with people's prophecies. A real prophet will never do that.Your sin of idolatry is very evident to all. In Twi,you will be told, \"wusuumwubu, dodo. Eye abusumsuum.\"I will appeal to all Christians, including members of the various churches' conference, councils and association, to rise up and condemn you and all those who are using God's Name in vain for personal gains. It is Christ who is being ridiculed here.Blessed be Jesus in the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar, Amen and Thank You.",

    "content": "It has been my pleasure since June of 2021, to work with Kerri Tompkins, auditor, for the elections. She has always been knowledgeable and helpful when I needed guidance.Kerri's strongest assets are her organizing skills. She reorganized the office to run smoother and more efficient elections. In doing this, education and training was maintained for all employees and poll workers. Kerri provided information folders for each precinct to review, if they had question on a certain topic. Training was implemented by using videos and in-person assistance.Technology has improved for the 2024 presidential election. There are touch screen monitors and brand new \"Tenex tablets\" for voting. Touch screens can be used by either the sight or hearing impaired. The tablet streamlines curbside voting. Each tablet has helped the poll workers tremendously with efficient, timely voting with the past June primary election and the September Special Election in Blue Grass. We anticipate that the new \"tablet\" will help immensely with the November presidential election.People are also reading...

    "title": "Opinion | Welcome to the uncanny valley of the 2024 election",
    "content": "Three weeks from Wednesday, every eligible ballot in the 2024 presidential election will have been cast. Election officials will have worked long into the night across the country to tabulate millions of votes. By the morning of Nov. 6, we may finally have an answer to the question those of us who work in, or around, politics have received constantly for months: \"Who's going to win?\"It's unfortunately the one question that nobody can answer with any certainty. There is no clear outcome in sight. There are no debates waiting ahead for Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump to share a stage. And there are no major events to circle on the calendar before the polls open. There is only a seeming eternity ahead for a race that lacks any clear favorite. The uncertainty makes these few remaining weeks particularly maddening, amplifying the smallest potential shift as monumental while leaving little room for the race to be fundamentally altered.In the 1970s, Japanese engineer researcher Masahiro Moti noted that \"in climbing toward the goal of making robots appear human, our affinity for them increases until we come to a valley, which I call the uncanny valley.\" The things that rest in this valley can cause a feeling of deep unease, distress and dismay as our minds struggle to categorize something that comes close to, but falls short of, appearing human.I've come to see this October as the uncanny valley of the election cycle. Stuck between the dynamism of the summer and the surety of November, Americans scour for anything to break the tension. The elusive \"October Surprise\" has accordingly gone from an event that nobody could see coming to a quadrennial prediction that has more often fallen flat, as pundits and politicos hunt for something -- anything -- to shake up the race.Unfortunately, the main balm that we all turn to in these moments isn't as curative as we may want. The latest national poll from NBC News shows Harris and Trump in a \"dead heat,\" with 48% each from registered voters and a margin of error of ±3.1%. On the surface, that seems like a major problem when polling in September showed Harris with a 6-point lead over Trump and the same margin of error.In practice, though, the margin of error means those two poll results aren't as far apart than they seem. Furthermore, these snapshots are our best guesses of how people within a pool of respondents feel right now, but they aren't the predictors that people want them to be. The usefulness of frantically refreshing polling averages is roughly the same as staring into an empty teacup looking for a sign among the leaves.Polls showing a stable race after Harris caught up, then passed Trump once President Joe Biden dropped out should be a comfort to Democrats. But panic is a tried-and-true part of Democratic identity, even when an electoral landslide is just around the corner. These final weeks are always a time of second-guessing, when the candidate's every choice up to that point is re-adjudicated and every sign is a red flag of impending disaster.Unlike the campaigns of her predecessors, Harris' campaign has played out on a condensed timeline, and with that compression comes greater heat and intensity. And so a billion dollars raised since Harris jumped into the race transforms into a potentially worrying sign that donors might not provide needed cash in the final sprint. Decisions on where to spend time and what message to send while there, whom to sit with for interviews, how resources are distributed among allies all become fodder for speculation about why Harris may lose.The sheer amount of noise generated trying to make sense of everything becomes a problem in itself. We're awash in a sea of opinions that are telling Harris she needs to change up her strategy in various contradictory ways before it's too late. These last few weeks are just enough time to turn a ship as big as a presidential campaign, at least in theory, to focus on the One Big Thing that will secure a win. In an election this close, though, there are so many different variables to try to solve for that it can feel impossible to find a formula that denies Trump an electoral victory.The resulting calculus sees Harris' campaign desperately trying to put together a coalition that can remain stable for the next 21 days. How do you both win back Black men who are open to Trump's ham-fisted appeals while also being relatable to the Never Trump Republicans you're wooing? How do you persuade progressives to turn out despite their hesitance over American support for Israel's war in Gaza while also focusing on slowing inflation and driving down consumer prices?I'll let you in on a professional secret here: I don't have an answer to those questions. Even the people doing the work of trying to win this election don't know for sure. These next three weeks are set to be a period of distinct discomfort as we stare into the unknown. There is no quick fix that will calm the vibes and reassure nervous Democrats. Instead, the most powerful thing we can do with an uncomfortable feeling is to acknowledge its sources and work toward the changes we wish to see.",

    "title": "Blaze News original: 10 disgusting, shameful examples of the militant left exacting its will against those in its way",
    "content": "What's the limit of the militant left's violence, bullying, and fascism? It's not likely we've seen its ceiling yet.Blaze News has covered the awful behavior of the militant left for as long as it's been publishing stories, and it doesn't appear it's going anywhere fast.'Off our streets Nazi scum! Off our streets Nazi scum!'As the 2024 presidential election approaches, it's wise to remind ourselves how destructive and dangerous militant leftists can be as we keep trying to get people in office who will stand up to them. In this collection of vignettes, we revisit 10 times the militant left has crossed way over the line.One of the worst was when a violent leftist mob was caught on a viral video following, converging upon, and threatening Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and his wife on a Washington, D.C., street after the 2020 Republican National Convention. \"They were yelling threats. They were trying to push the police over to get to me. They were grabbing at us, and it got worse and worse and worse,\" Paul told Fox News the following day.Then, there was the viral moment when Antifa members were caught on video screaming at a tiny, white-haired woman using a walker, \"Off our streets Nazi scum!\" and blocking her path in a crosswalk outside a conservative event ... and the time when an unhinged leftist was caught on video screaming high-pitched orders at motorists in the middle of a road, \"Do black lives matter to you?!\" One woman doesn't answer correctly -- and things get scary.Remember the shameful moment when two out-of-their-minds females got caught on video ripping up signs supporting then-President Donald Trump and stealing a red \"Make America Great Again\" hat while a 7-year-old boy cried and chased after them with his mother?It may be that the depths to which the militant left will sink knows no bounds. If that's true, we're in for an even bumpier ride for the foreseeable future.A violent leftist mob was caught on video chasing and converging upon Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and his wife on a Washington, D.C., street after the 2020 Republican National Convention outside the White House.Viral video caught the throng of shouting, pushing protesters harassing Paul and his wife as police tried to protect them. The next morning, Paul shared more about what happened: \"Just got attacked by an angry mob of over 100, one block away from the White House. Thank you to @DCPoliceDept for literally saving our lives from a crazed mob.\"Several officers can be heard hollering to the mob to move back as they yell back, \"Say her name!\" in reference to the Louisville police killing of Breonna Taylor. One officer can be seen trying to push back demonstrators with a bicycle, but the mob surges toward the officer, and Paul grabs the officer's arm to prevent him from falling.In an interview the next day, Paul told Fox News, \"They were yelling threats. They were trying to push the police over to get to me. They were grabbing at us, and it got worse and worse and worse.\"Rep. Brian Mast (R-Fla.) said he also was harassed on a D.C. street following the RNC. Mast, a veteran who lost both legs during a 2010 Afghanistan tour, shared video of his encounter and added: \"They thought I would be an easy target because my prosthetics move slowly. They were wrong.\"In the clip, a small, white woman with pigtails angrily asks Mast, \"How do you feel about police killing black people in this country?\" As she and others in the mob get closer to Mast's face, she orders Mast to \"answer the question I am asking you!\" Mast attempts to answer the question several times, but she grows increasingly loud and continues repeating the question -- this time with hand gestures to hammer home her demand. At this point, Mast is completely surrounded by demonstrators who are growing increasingly agitated.Masked left-wing protesters identified as Antifa were caught on video screaming at a tiny, white-haired woman with a walker, \"Off our streets Nazi scum! Off our streets Nazi scum!\" outside a conservative event at a Canadian college on the evening of Sept. 29, 2019.As they blocked the elderly woman's path in a crosswalk, an elderly man accompanying her shot back a retort to the mob, after which one protester screamed at him, \"Don't f***ing touch me! Don't f***ing touch me!\"You can view video here of the jaw-dropping actions.A crowd of about 100 protesters against the event at Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario, stood outside with signs advocating for immigrant rights and yelling chants denouncing those entering, comparing them to Nazis and neo-Nazis, the CBC reported.Supporters of the People's Party -- some wearing \"Make America Great Again\" hats, the iconic symbol of President Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign -- stood behind police and engaged with protesters for about an hour.A scuffle broke out in the crowd, and police led away in handcuffs two men from opposing sides of the protests, the CBC reported. There were four arrests for \"breach of the peace,\" Hamilton police told the outlet, adding that all were later released without conditions.Left-winger Alyssa Milano -- the mostly activist and sometimes actress -- started off her eventful 2020 Memorial Day weekend with a viral, virtue-signaling declaration showing her crocheted COVID face mask and encouraging others to post similar photos. After Milano got mocked into oblivion for her mask's relatively large holes, she lashed out at her critics, calling them \"assholes\" and then saying her mask \"has a filter in it for f***'s sake.\" Uh, charming.Milano was nothing if not on a roll, hopping back on social media on Memorial Day to seemingly praise a mob of shoppers who cursed out and drove off a woman from a supermarket for not wearing a COVID mask: \"Never been prouder of growing up in Staten Island,\" she wrote in reference to the viral video.As you'd expect, plenty of leftists support Milano's tireless activism on their behalf, and they showed it with comments in support for her post. But others blasted her.Regarding the video in question, a number of customers began screaming demands at the maskless woman such as \"Get the f*** out of here!\" and pointing to the store's exit while others were heard hollering, \"Get out!\" and calling her a \"dirty ass pig!\" The woman reportedly left the store.A spokesperson for ShopRite -- where the incident took place -- told CBS News in a statement Monday that store management reported it to authorities. ShopRite added to the network that customers who notice others without face coverings should tell customer service instead of taking matters into their own hands.George Floyd protesters were caught on an absolutely insane video descending upon a Maryland street near Interstate 270 in early June 2020 -- and one unhinged, ultra-confrontational leftist took it upon herself to scream a question at passing cars: \"Do black lives matter to you?!\"One motorist seemed all in and answered affirmatively with his fist raised, so the self-appointed toll booth collector let the driver pass. But one woman made the mistake of completely ignoring the protester's screamed question as she passed by, after which the leftist in a high-pitched holler called her a \"f***in' white piece of s**t!\" and a \"bitch!\" -- and even appeared to challenge her to a fight: \"Oh yeah?! You wanna f***in' go, Karen?!\"Arriving at the driver's window, the protester screamed, \"Until black lives matter, no lives matter!\" The driver made a reference to people of different colors, presumably as a way of communicating that all people are equal and then said to get out of her way. But the screaming protester wasn't having it, hollered back at the woman, then stood in front of her vehicle. Then things got a little scarier.Other protesters joined in the fray and began assembling near the vehicle; \"She ain't goin' nowhere\" a male declared as a protester banged on the hood of the woman's SUV.Either frightened, angry, or both, the driver leaned into her horn for a spell -- but it was no use: \"Whatcha gonna do?\" the same man apparently repeats. \"You're not goin' nowhere.\"Check out the video here.As you might imagine, social users weren't happy with the protesters' tactics, and some made it clear how they would respond if in the same situation:On election night 2020 in Washington, D.C., the usual leftist suspects decked out in Antifa garb surprised no one as they tried to cause as much unrest as possible. But one scene in particular attracted a fair amount of attention on social media.Cell phone video captured a large crowd of leftists filling a street and most of a sidewalk at Black Lives Matter Plaza when a bearded man wearing a white shirt and dark jacket tried to pass by -- but a hooded individual pressed up to the man and wouldn't let him pass.It isn't clear what -- if anything -- the leftist asked, but it appeared as though the smiling, bearded man simply wanted to proceed down the sidewalk with as little trouble as possible, and it seemed like he nodded and said something that ended with \"lives matter.\"With that, the leftist fired a lightning-fast punch to the man's face. The victim tried going after his attacker, but one of the leftist's comrades descended upon and briefly wrestled with the victim -- yet the bearded man still managed to land a couple of punches upon his second opponent. Soon several other leftists in typical leftist fashion ganged up on the victim -- including one who appeared to hit him with what looked like a bat, and upon impact it seemed to resonate with a metallic \"plink.\" Somehow the victim got up and quickly walked away.Soon the victim was seen walking down a street with the assistance of another man who managed to keep at bay the leftist gang that apparently followed from the attack site. Brendan Gutenschwager, the journalist who captured the action, said the victim's head was bleeding. The victim remarked that he was hit in the head with a glass bottle as he and the man who helped him eventually arrived to the safety of a police line.Amid such intense racial strife dominating the headlines, it was powerful to see a black man standing up and helping the injured white victim. This man then confronted the leftist mob by emphasizing in no uncertain terms that the victim is \"a human being.\"\"Y'all think this s**t is cute?\" he told them. \"That man has rights just like everybody else. And throwing s**t at somebody doesn't solve the problem. The election is going on.\"The two Delaware females who were caught on video ripping up signs supporting then-President Donald Trump and stealing a red \"Make America Great Again\" hat while a 7-year-old boy cried and chased after them soon after were indicted on hate crime charges.Olivia Winslow and Camryn Amy -- both 21 and from Wilmington -- on Sept. 8, 2020, were indicted by a New Castle County grand jury on charges of second-degree robbery, second-degree conspiracy, endangering the welfare of a child, third-degree assault, attempted third-degree assault, offensive touching, and felony hate crimes, Delaware Online reported.Three of the seven charges are felonies and collectively are punishable by 15 years in prison, the outlet said, adding that the hate crime charges could lead to the most prison time. Winslow and Amy were released on bail, a spokesman for Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings told Delaware Online. The outlet said it's unclear when they are to be arraigned.The cell phone video -- recorded Aug. 20 near the venue for the virtual Democratic National Convention -- shows two females harassing a mother and her young son. The females ripped pro-Trump signs and stole a MAGA hat sitting near the boy, whose mother recorded the altercation. The boy can be seen running after the females and saying, \"That's somebody else's hat!\" Soon he starts crying. The mom and son followed the females through a parking lot as things heated up.At one point, the boy sees another hat on the ground, and when he goes to retrieve it, one of the females actually appears to stomp her foot to prevent him from picking it up. The video doesn't show whether she makes contact with the boy's hand. But when a man the mom apparently knows attempts to intervene, the same female appears to hit him in the face. Soon she tosses the stolen hat over the fence. The other female then throws part of a ripped sign over a fence as well. The same female who appeared to hit the man in the face and stomped her foot near the boy's hand went after the mom, as the camera seems to show the female taking a swipe at her. Soon the clip ends.As you can probably guess, the court dealt with them leniently. While they were sentenced later in September on misdemeanor charges of theft, child endangerment, and hate crimes, Delaware Online reported that neither of them would go to jail. Instead, Judge Francis J. Jones agreed to the prosecutors' recommendation to sentence the pair to multiple counts of conditional probation.On the 70th night of left-wing protests in Portland, Oregon, over the summer of 2020, rioters decked out in dark clothing and helmets attacked the East Precinct of the city's police on Aug. 6. Amid the rioting and vandalism at the precinct, KOIN-TV reported that officers were hit with projectiles that included glass bottles and rocks -- and cops said one officer was severely injured after taking a large rock to the shoulder.In the middle of all that, the station said an elderly woman who said she lives in the neighborhood pleaded with the group to stop the vandalism and stood in the way of those who were splashing paint on the plywood outside the building.Then, they actually splashed paint on her, too, KOIN noted. But instead of realizing how far out of hand they'd gotten, the violent left-wingers started yelling at the elderly woman: \"This isn't your world anymore!\"When she began yelling back at the rioters, one of them walked over with yellow crime-scene tape and placed it on her before wrapping it around her headAfter the elderly woman hollered at the crowd that \"we died for you!\" the same leftist who wrapped the crime-scene tape around her head -- and towers over her by a foot -- rushed back and got in her face, leaned down, and yelled at her. It's not clear exactly what either of them said, but the elderly woman appeared to tell the rioter that she took part in marching. A female rioter was heard yelling at the elderly woman, \"Put your mask on, bitch! Put your mask on!\" Check out the clip here.The rioters doubled down on their tactics against elderly women at the precinct after noticing one -- using a walker, no less -- was in the process of trying to extinguish a fire in a trash can. But Antifa is nothing if not thorough. KOIN noted that the woman \"was blocked by a person dressed in all black.\"Comrades of the courageous leftist blocking the woman were heard off camera laughing at and mocking her with one finally saying, \"Just let her do it! Let her do it. It's the highlight of her life! C'mon, we wanna see it!\" The rioter ended up moving left and right in front of the woman as she tried to extinguish the fire. As a chant of \"all cops are bastards!\" in the background, the elderly woman with the walker got a shot into the can and put out the fire. Check out the clip here.Surveillance video shows a homeless person on the night of Nov. 4, 2020, curled up on the sidewalk outside the doors of St. Andre Bessette Church in downtown Portland, Oregon. Then, into the camera frame comes a marching group of black-clad Antifa militants. One of them approaches the area where the homeless person is curled up, pays no attention to the individual, and promptly smashes the church's doors and windows.A church leader who filed a police report told officers the church was forced to close its shelter and halt homeless services because staff can't safely open or close the building's extensively damaged doors. St. Andre Bessette serves several hundred people a day, providing shelter, meals, and other services to homeless individuals, police added.\"Until I can get the building secured, everything's coming to a stop,\" Father Tom Gaughan told KGW-TV. \"So there's hundreds of people that we would normally give out food to, and we're not gonna be able to because of this.\" Gaughan added to KOIN-TV that he's also suspending church services, including mass, until the building is secured.\"We ask for everyone's prayers for peace in our streets, which is so long overdue and pray for our sisters and brothers who call the streets and shelters home,\" Gaughan also told KOIN. \"Because the act of one person has prevented us from providing for hundreds of people over the course of a week.\"You can view a video reporter here about the crime.In early 2020, cell phone video showed John Dennis -- chairman of the San Francisco Republican Party -- conversing with a bearded guy who Dennis identified as an Antifa member. The problem, apparently, was that Dennis was running against Democrat Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi in the fall.The Antifa agitator told Dennis -- who was there helping a street cleanup effort -- \"Bruh, I'ma gonna catch you when all the cameras aren't around, and I'm gonna f*** you up.\" And that's just for starters.The bearded guy also told Dennis that \"I want you dead.\" The Republican naturally wondered why.\"Because you're a piece of s**t,\" the Antifa guy told Dennis.Then, when the GOP candidate rightly argued back, asking the bearded guy how he could possibly come to that conclusion, the Antifa guy offered an insight that pretty much sums up the leftist state of mind: \"I can tell by looking at you.\"Dennis posted a video Feb. 4 that offered more insight on what happened between him and the Antifa fellow. Dennis explained that he learned 30 to 40 Antifa members showed up to protest the cleanup effort just because Republicans were involved -- and the guy in the yellow shirt seemed to want to stand out from other Antifa members dressed in dark clothing. He also stood out for other reasons, Dennis added, after flipping over a canopy and threatening various individuals in the crowd. The yellow-shirted Antifa guy seemed to be \"giving backbone\" to the \"rest of the lightweight Antifa,\" Dennis noted.It was at that point that Dennis said he tried talking to the yellow-shirted guy, and then the threats happened. Dennis added that what's not seen on the clip is that he approached the Antifa agitator again and with some \"rough language\" informed him that he wasn't going to be intimidated -- which is when our bearded hero departed and \"the crowd lost a lot of its fight.\" While Dennis said, \"Violence is just unacceptable,\" when push comes to shove and threats are issued, \"You gotta stand up to them.\"Marquise Love -- accused of kicking a man in the head from behind and knocking him out cold after repeatedly punching him amid a Portland protest in August 2020 -- was sentenced to 20 months in prison later in the year, KOIN-TV reported.You can view a video report here showing the head kick.Love received the sentence after pleading guilty to third-degree assault and felony riot as well undergoing \"months of pretrial negotiations and a judicial settlement conference,\" the station said, citing the Multnomah County District Attorney's Office.\nHis guilty plea acknowledges that he caused physical injury to the victim, identified as Adam Haner, and that 'he and others engaged in tumultuous and violent conduct and created a grave risk of causing public alarm.'The DA's office said Haner, as well as law enforcement, the court and the state, found the resolution in this case 'appropriate.' Haner was not personally at the sentencing hearing on Monday, but has previously said in interviews with the media that he hoped Love would learn from what happened.Love apologized to the victim in court, according to the DA's office, and reportedly expressed genuine remorse.After his time behind bars, Love will have to complete 36 months of probation, KOIN reported, adding that any violations could result in additional prison time. He also must undergo an alcohol abuse evaluation and comply with any recommended treatment, the station said.Portland police identified Love as the suspect seen in cell phone videos repeatedly punching a man who was forced by a mob to sit in the street after which the suspect kicked the victim in the head from behind and apparently knocked him out.The beating began after the victim was trying to get away from violent protesters and crashed his truck -- then a mob descended upon him.Haner, recounting the incident to KPTV-TV, said he was yanked out of his vehicle and hit the ground, after which the mob \"wouldn't let me get up\" -- and then the beating began.\"I was just standing for myself as a citizen,\" he told the station, \"and if you can't do that on a street, then what can you do?\"Like Blaze News?

    "title": "Tom Zirpoli: Trump is compromised by relationship with Putin | COMMENTARY",
    "content": "I remember running a nonprofit during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and how frustrating it was not to know if a staff member or a client had COVID when trying to schedule staff to cover our group homes for adults with developmental disabilities. Before we had instant testing for COVID, it was common for us to wait two weeks or more to get a test result from the lab. By then, anyone who was positive had already spread it to others and had likely recovered. In other words, the tests were useless in protecting millions of Americans from a potentially deadly virus.It was disturbing to find out that while America was going through this nightmare and tens of thousands of Americans were dying from COVID each month, the president of the United States, Donald Trump, was reportedly sending advanced testing machines to Russian President Vladimir Putin. These rapid testing machines could have been used here in America to more quickly identify positive cases and help stop the spread of COVID in places like nursing homes and other communities of high-risk populations, like our group homes. However, instead of looking out for his fellow Americans, Trump was looking out for Putin.So much for Trump's \"America First\" campaign.I could overlook this if, for example, Trump was using the testing machines in a trade to secure the release of American hostages held by Putin at the time. But that was not the case. One might be able to overlook Trump's actions if he was using the machines as a negotiating tool to change Putin's aggression toward Ukraine at the time. But that was not the case.These revelations have been reported in Bob Woodward's new book, which also revealed that Trump may have spoken to Putin at least seven times since leaving office. As MSNBC columnist Michael Cohen noted, \"All this was happening at the same time that Trump pushed congressional Republicans to block renewed military assistance for Ukraine.\"Trump consistently promotes policies that benefit Putin. He criticizes NATO as well as U.S. support for Ukraine and our other allies in Europe and beyond. For Putin, Trump is the gift that keeps on giving.As expected, Trump said the story was false, but the Kremlin confirmed Woodward's findings. Like so many other Trump lies, more evidence will likely show him, not Woodward, having trouble with the truth. It sounds like something Trump would do to impress Putin, whom he admires.Besides the obvious issue with this transfer of advanced COVID testing machines to Russia while thousands of Americans were dying, there is also the issue of a likely violation of the U.S. sanctions embargo the United States had at the time following Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea in Ukraine.What did Trump and Putin talk about during those private phone calls after he left office? Was Trump telling Putin how he could help with the 2024 presidential election? No one knows. But Putin knows. National security officials say that if the phone calls took place, Putin has a recording of the conversations. In other words, Trump is significantly compromised as Putin hangs those recordings over his head.Putin isn't the only dictator with whom Trump has had an out-of-office relationship. He has frequently talked with and had meetings with Hungary's self-appointed authoritarian, Viktor Orban, who has called Trump the \"most respected, most feared\" leader in the world. Orban sure knows how to flatter Trump, doesn't he?While Trump praises dictators around the world, he frequently criticizes America, American leaders, the U.S. military, and American allies around the world. Yet, he has nothing but praise for Putin. After Putin invaded Ukraine in 2022, Trump said, \"I'd say that's pretty smart. He's taking over a country -- really a vast, vast location, a great piece of land with lots of people, and just walking right in.\"To date, Trump has not condemned Putin's invasion of one of America's allies. Instead, he saves his condemnation for America and our allies while we try to defend freedom and democracy in Ukraine. All of these behaviors should be red flags to his supporters, but MAGA Republicans don't seem to care that their presidential nominee is a Russian asset.According to Cohen, \"If there is one defining characteristic of Trump's emotional makeup, it is an overweening desire for constant validation -- particularly from men. The fact that Putin 'likes' him is far more important to Trump than the threat the Russian leader represents to American interests, U.S. allies or global stability.\"Putin's most significant concern today is his two-year failing war in Ukraine. Only Trump can save him by getting elected in November, cutting off U.S. aid to Ukraine and allowing Russia to keep the territory it has seized in eastern Ukraine. This move would undercut the security of the United States and our relationship with allies in Europe. It would empower China to invade Taiwan, says William Pomerantz, an analyst at the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. It would send the message to the world that the United States of America is unwilling to defend its allies against Russian aggression and would put all of our allies at risk for future Russian aggression.A vote for Trump in November is a vote for Putin and his continued aggression.",

    "title": "Opinion | Welcome to the uncanny valley of the 2024 election",
    "content": "With less than three weeks until Election Day, the presidential race has entered a period of extremely uncomfortable uncertainty.Three weeks from Wednesday, every eligible ballot in the 2024 presidential election will have been cast. Election officials will have worked long into the night across the country to tabulate millions of votes. By the morning of Nov. 6, we may finally have an answer to the question those of us who work in, or around, politics have received constantly for months: \"Who's going to win?\"It's unfortunately the one question that nobody can answer with any certainty. There is no clear outcome in sight. There are no debates waiting ahead for Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump to share a stage. And there are no major events to circle on the calendar before the polls open. There is only a seeming eternity ahead for a race that lacks any clear favorite. The uncertainty makes these few remaining weeks particularly maddening, amplifying the smallest potential shift as monumental while leaving little room for the race to be fundamentally altered.In the 1970s, Japanese engineer researcher Masahiro Moti noted that \"in climbing toward the goal of making robots appear human, our affinity for them increases until we come to a valley, which I call the uncanny valley.\" The things that rest in this valley can cause a feeling of deep unease, distress and dismay as our minds struggle to categorize something that comes close to, but falls short of, appearing human.I've come to see this October as the uncanny valley of the election cycle. Stuck between the dynamism of the summer and the surety of November, Americans scour for anything to break the tension. The elusive \"October Surprise\" has accordingly gone from an event that nobody could see coming to a quadrennial prediction that has more often fallen flat, as pundits and politicos hunt for something -- anything -- to shake up the race.Unfortunately, the main balm that we all turn to in these moments isn't as curative as we may want. The latest national poll from NBC News shows Harris and Trump in a \"dead heat,\" with 48% each from registered voters and a margin of error of ±3.1%. On the surface, that seems like a major problem when polling in September showed Harris with a 6-point lead over Trump and the same margin of error.In practice, though, the margin of error means those two poll results aren't as far apart than they seem. Furthermore, these snapshots are our best guesses of how people within a pool of respondents feel right now, but they aren't the predictors that people want them to be. The usefulness of frantically refreshing polling averages is roughly the same as staring into an empty teacup looking for a sign among the leaves.Polls showing a stable race after Harris caught up, then passed Trump once President Joe Biden dropped out should be a comfort to Democrats. But panic is a tried-and-true part of Democratic identity, even when an electoral landslide is just around the corner. These final weeks are always a time of second-guessing, when the candidate's every choice up to that point is re-adjudicated and every sign is a red flag of impending disaster.Unlike the campaigns of her predecessors, Harris' campaign has played out on a condensed timeline, and with that compression comes greater heat and intensity. And so a billion dollars raised since Harris jumped into the race transforms into a potentially worrying sign that donors might not provide needed cash in the final sprint. Decisions on where to spend time and what message to send while there, whom to sit with for interviews, how resources are distributed among allies all become fodder for speculation about why Harris may lose.The sheer amount of noise generated trying to make sense of everything becomes a problem in itself. We're awash in a sea of opinions that are telling Harris she needs to change up her strategy in various contradictory ways before it's too late. These last few weeks are just enough time to turn a ship as big as a presidential campaign, at least in theory, to focus on the One Big Thing that will secure a win. In an election this close, though, there are so many different variables to try to solve for that it can feel impossible to find a formula that denies Trump an electoral victory.The resulting calculus sees Harris' campaign desperately trying to put together a coalition that can remain stable for the next 21 days. How do you both win back Black men who are open to Trump's ham-fisted appeals while also being relatable to the Never Trump Republicans you're wooing? How do you persuade progressives to turn out despite their hesitance over American support for Israel's war in Gaza while also focusing on slowing inflation and driving down consumer prices?I'll let you in on a professional secret here: I don't have an answer to those questions. Even the people doing the work of trying to win this election don't know for sure. These next three weeks are set to be a period of distinct discomfort as we stare into the unknown. There is no quick fix that will calm the vibes and reassure nervous Democrats. Instead, the most powerful thing we can do with an uncomfortable feeling is to acknowledge its sources and work toward the changes we wish to see.",

    "content": "'Bruh, I'ma gonna catch you when all the cameras aren't around, and I'm gonna f*** you up ... I want you dead.'What's the limit of the militant left's violence, bullying, and fascism? It's not likely we've seen its ceiling yet.Blaze News has covered the awful behavior of the militant left for as long as it's been publishing stories, and it doesn't appear it's going anywhere fast.'Off our streets Nazi scum! Off our streets Nazi scum!'As the 2024 presidential election approaches, it's wise to remind ourselves how destructive and dangerous militant leftists can be as we keep trying to get people in office who will stand up to them. In this collection of vignettes, we revisit 10 times the militant left has crossed way over the line.One of the worst was when a violent leftist mob was caught on a viral video following, converging upon, and threatening Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and his wife on a Washington, D.C., street after the 2020 Republican National Convention. \"They were yelling threats. They were trying to push the police over to get to me. They were grabbing at us, and it got worse and worse and worse,\" Paul told Fox News the following day.Then, there was the viral moment when Antifa members were caught on video screaming at a tiny, white-haired woman using a walker, \"Off our streets Nazi scum!\" and blocking her path in a crosswalk outside a conservative event ... and the time when an unhinged leftist was caught on video screaming high-pitched orders at motorists in the middle of a road, \"Do black lives matter to you?!\" One woman doesn't answer correctly -- and things get scary.Remember the shameful moment when two out-of-their-minds females got caught on video ripping up signs supporting then-President Donald Trump and stealing a red \"Make America Great Again\" hat while a 7-year-old boy cried and chased after them with his mother?It may be that the depths to which the militant left will sink knows no bounds. If that's true, we're in for an even bumpier ride for the foreseeable future.",

    "title": "Rev. Owusu Bempah, Please Stop This Idolatry - The Ghanaian Chronicle",
    "content": "Rev. Owusu Bempah, for the sake of Jesus Christ, as a Christian who got born again at age ten, may I please advise you to stop this mortal sin of idolatry? You always worship your ego, raising yourself above all, including God, if you do not know. It is only God that we must worship, not humans (Rev. 22: 8-9). Even when Jesus came down to Earth, He never demanded to be worshipped.He who is God, sohumbled Himself to became man and led a humble life as He showed men, the path to salvation. But here you are, together with some self-acclaimed men and women of God, parading yourselves around as if all authority in Heaven and on earth have been given to you, to do whatever you like.Unfortunately, your conducts are rather making a mockery of Christianity, which now seems to be an avenuefor amassing of wealth and fame, instead of amassing souls to Heaven. And by your deeds, any non-Christian who has not read the Bible may think Christianity is a bad religion and Christ is fake. You are doing great injustice to Christianity and this is sinful.And when God-fearing people draw your attention to your false prophecies and your un-Christlike manners, you get mad at them and curse them. True Christians do not do that. Jesus Christ was spat upon, slapped, beaten with whips and finally nailed to the Cross, but He rather pleaded with God to forgive those who did that to Him (Luke 23:34).And Stephen also prayed for forgiveness for those who were killing him (Acts 7:60). Be very careful who you curse. You may curse someone after God's heart and consequences may not be good for you. Seriously, by your deeds are you truly a servant of Godand a follower of Christ?Personally, anddrawing from the knowledge of virtues I get from my Church, the Holy Catholic Church, I do not see the virtue of humility, the foundation of all virtues in you and those self-acclaimed servants of God, who openly attack each other with curses and display of who is more powerful.The Sacred Scriptures teaches me a lot about the true prophets of God and the false ones. The true prophets always say exactly what God tells them, \"Thus says the Lord!\" Whether palatable or not; And areready to die for saying it.The false prophets are always around the politicians, (the kings, etc.) and will always tell them what will please them (Jeremiah 23:9-40; Ezekiel 13.) From what I read about true prophets and false ones, it looks like we have in Ghana, prophets who want to be favoured by politicians and that classifiesthe lot of you,as false prophets.You lot are not doing Christianity any favour by always being divided over what you say are God's prophecies on issues, most especially on who will be the next president. How come the One and Same True God have different opinions when it comes to a simple issue like who will lead the nation?If indeed, God spoke those words, then we may havein one group,the true prophets and in another, the false ones.Over the past three years, you come out strongly with two names who will win the 2024 presidential election. First, you said God has told you that Alan Kyerematen would win both the NPP presidential primary and become our next president in 2025.Unfortunately, Alan did not contest the primary and went on to leave the NPP to run as an independent candidate in the presidential race. So, are you saying God did not know this will happen?Then, you came back to tell us that, God has chosen Mahama to win the presidential election. If this is truly a prophecy from God, then He must tell us why Mahama, since you said in 2020, that God told you, Mahama will never be president again. Or is it because NPP did not give you what you demanded; you have decided to shift to the NDC, hoping to still maintain your title and rank as presidential prophet?Or, you do not want a non-Christian to lead this country? I have to ask these questions, not because I am against Mahama winning, but you are just a confused lot. If Mahama wins, it will be through the daily prayerful intercessions by true and good Christians and non-Christians and also through his total submission to God and his personal relationship with Christ. You have no contribution in this.Now assuming Mahama does not win, what will be your caveat? You will come to say he did not do what you told him to do?So, come out clear and tell us now, what Mahama must do to win this election. So that if evidence shows that he did not do what he was instructed to do and he fails to win, we will believe your prophecy.One of your followers was on television, saying he had a vision of you in the spiritual realm, forcefully taking the sword of governance from Nana Addo. Who does he think he is deceiving? Every body knows that Nana Addo is not contesting elections and had pledged to hand-over to the one who wins the elections, so what is this about him keeping that sword? Come on, we are not children who can easily be deceived. But, why were you appointed to fight him for the sword, when you are not contesting the presidential elections? Stop these jokes.You and some of the prophets are on television prophesying bloody conflicts during and after the 2024 Elections. We have heard all this before. No blood shed will occur during Election 2024. Personnel in our Armed Forces are for the nation and not for any politician, sothey will never allow this to happen.Now, when we come to the issue of humility, none inyour class of modern-day tele-prophets, can score even a grade \"E\". Your pride and arroganceare just too much.Remember the true servants of God and Jesus, Himself were so humble and would never make themselves important even after performing miracles.In 2 Kings 5, is a classic example of how a humble prophet of God should conduct himself. This was about Naaman the Syrian general and Prophet Elisha, who never came to meet the general, to draw attention to himself, but only send down instructions on how he can be healed.And there are occasions when Jesus either directly forbade people He cured from broadcasting about Him or He simply shied away from the scene.If it were you and those others, you will throw yourself around feeling so important and demanding to be adored.Personally, I do not believe you are what you claim to be. You are an embarrassment to Christianity and you must be told this truth.In December 2018, you said God gave you a list of people who would die in 2019, which included the former first lady H.E. Theresa Kufuor, who was 83 years at that time and the National Chief Imam, Shiekh Nuhu Sharubutu who was 99 years, then.When the Muslim youth,stormed your church for further clarifications, you run to the National Chief Imam and went down on all four, like Afia Pokuaa at the Manhyia Palace, and begged for forgiveness, adding that God's prophecy was not correct and the Shiekh was no longer going to die. Either you must be very powerful to be able to halt, whatever God decides to do, or you are fake. I will settle for the latter. Prophets of old, died for proclaiming God's prophecy, but here you are declaring God never spoke well, just to save your skin. That day you made Christianity look fake and a scam.As you are aware, the former First Lady, lived on for almost five more years before departingthis life to eternal glory and the National Chief Imam is now 105 years and still very strong as God keeps blessing him every day.Some education for you, when God says to someone, he is to die, it means the person's soul will perish in hell (2 Kings 20: 1-4 and the Book of Jonah). When someone is to die and gain eternal life in Heaven, God will say, \"today, you will be with Me in Paradise.\"(Luke 23:42-43). These words from Jesus to the dying Dismas, the repentant armed robber, saved his soul.Another thing that you should be aware of, prophecies which are about someone, are to be told directly to them and not proclaimed publicly. Prophet Nathan's encounter with King David is a classic example, (2 Samuel 12:1-25). Verse 1, is clear:\"God sent Nathan to David...\" God did not send Nathan to the public square. David could have been dethroned if what he did went public. But you always go public with people's prophecies. A real prophet will never do that.Your sin of idolatry is very evident to all. In Twi,you will be told, \"wusuumwubu, dodo. Eye abusumsuum.\"I will appeal to all Christians, including members of the various churches' conference, councils and association, to rise up and condemn you and all those who are using God's Name in vain for personal gains. It is Christ who is being ridiculed here.Blessed be Jesus in the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar, Amen and Thank You.",

    "title": "The 44-year-old novice politician hoping to truly 'retire' 60+ year-olds",
    "content": "The last time someone in his forties was president of Ghana, was in 1992, when the late former Head of State, Flt. Lt, Jerry John Rawlings, became the first president of the fourth republic of Ghana.As a young 45-year-old Airforce soldier-pilot, he left his mark as a force to be reckoned with, giving Ghana its most stable republic since independence in 1957, but since then, not so many people in that age bracket have been successful at becoming Head of State.But there is a young, daring, and ambitious man who is confident that with all the work that he has done, being able to rally the youth behind his vision, he can give Ghana its next youthful president.Nana Kwame Bediako, popularly known as Cheddar or Freedom Jacob Caesar, is the brain behind the New Force Movement and he is confident he can cause a major shake in the political landscape of Ghana on December 7, 2024, when the nation goes to the polls.Seated at Number 12 on the ballot papers, Cheddar ultimately wants to work towards a United States of Africa, with a cooked-up plan of a $50,000 Citizenship by Investment program aimed at raising a whopping $50 billion for Ghana's economy.The 44-year-old is also convinced that he is the man to actually retire all the 60+ candidates in the race, regardless of the fact that these same 'retirees' head the biggest political parties in Ghana; the same two parties that have ruled Ghana since the dawn of the fourth republic.But what is Cheddar's vision for Ghana?On September 1, 2024, the leader of the New Force Movement, Nana Kwame Bediako, launched his manifesto for the 2024 presidential election.The manifesto, dubbed '12 Pillars for Economic Freedom,' detailed Cheddar's policies and plans to help Ghana get out of its current hardships and eventually achieve economic liberation.They are:Run a government of only 12 ministersCheddar promised to run the leanest government in Ghana's history with only 12 ministers if elected president on December 7, 2024.His 'Apostolic Government' would have the following ministries: Finance, Trade, Education, Agriculture, Foreign Affairs, Interior, Sports and Business Development, Health, Justice, Energy, Business and Employment, Defence, and Tourism. he stated.Raise $50 billion by monetising Ghanaian citizenshipThe presidential hopeful also indicated that the major source of funds for his government would be selling Ghanaian citizenship.He indicated that this would help the country raise $50 billion, which would be a solution to Ghana's problems.He explained that his government would come up with an immigration package to monetise Ghana's citizenship.This initiative, he also indicated, would be the starting point of having a United States of Africa.\"We  will be the first people to start the project USA - United States of Africa, by people joining us  and we welcoming them through our borders but also, they will also be investing on our land.\"Ghana would print its own currencyHe also pledged to move the country away from engaging foreign countries when it comes to printing currency notes if given the nod in the pending presidential elections.He argued that Ghana does not need to source the printing of its currency to firms operating in countries like Switzerland, Belarus, England, and others.\"What happens to the industrial power that we are creating now? We are going to print money on our own. We don't need to go to America or England to print money.\"We don't need to go anywhere else to buy food and bring it here. We don't need to pay seven times the taxes of what is already in our country, packaged by someone else at a premium price, and bring it back here. That stops because we are going to create them here,\" Nana Kwame Bediako said.Change SSNIT into National Insurance FundThe leader of the New Force also promised to change the Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT) to the National Insurance Fund.Under the National Insurance Fund, he said contributors can go for their monies at any time.Establish a National Sovereign Wealth Fund, the new IMFCheddar also stated that he would establish a National Sovereign Wealth Fund which would help the country stop borrowing and free it from the International Monetary Fund.\"We are going to create the National Sovereign Wealth Fund; this is the new IMF. Well, at this very point, Ghana will help me launch the new IMF. Because verbally it is said but physically and mentally, we are about to implement it. This pillar is a new policy and it will disrupt and dissolve but eventually, it will rebuild our heritage value.\"In the past, our minerals have been extracted and exported for pennies, we are ending it. The National Sovereign Wealth Fund is the new IMF, independent and autonomous. It will collect every reserve and will keep it and protect it.\"Construct Ghana's first water transportationCheddar also proposed the creation of a water transport system as a solution to Ghana's transport system.This, he believes, would help expand the country's transport system and allow for ease and cheaper transportation of persons, goods, and services.His other objective for the transport sector would be to construct an 8000KM railway line across the country.Build a food reserve to serve Ghana for the next 100 yearsThe founder of the New Force also stated that his government, under an 'Agro Reserves' programme, would capitalise on the arable lands of the country to establish the biggest seedling bank.He indicated that this would help Ghana in terms of food security for 100 years and be able to also supply to the world.\"We intend to build the biggest seedling bank and have food security for 100 years.

    "content": "Kamala Harris is leading Donald Trump in the race to win the 2024 US presidential election, according to the latest poll of polls.However, the contest remains too close to call in the crucial battleground states that will decide who is the next president.On this page you will find the latest national and state polls to see how the two candidates are faring ahead of the November 5th election.National polling averages show Harris gaining on Trump after US president Joe Biden dramatically dropped out of the race on July 20th.The US vice president currently has a more than two-point lead over her Republican rival, according to averages by polling analysis website 538, which is part of American news network ABC News.However, national polls are merely indicators in US presidential elections, because the overall winner is decided using the winner-takes-all electoral college system.Each state is given a number of electoral college votes roughly in line with the size of its population. The candidate who wins the most votes in a state takes all the electoral college votes in that state.A total of 538 electoral college votes are up for grabs, so a candidate needs to reach 270 to win.It is possible for a president to win the electoral college while losing the popular vote - as happened with George W Bush in 2000 and Trump in 2016.Because many states vote dependably for Democrats or Republicans in presidential elections, the outcome usually rests on a handful of states where the election is truly competitive.Polls show Trump and Harris are neck and neck in the seven so-called swing states: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina.With 19 electoral votes, Pennsylvania is the biggest prize among the battleground states.Harris currently has a slight lead over Trump in Pennsylvania, according to the latest polling averages, though well within the margin of error.If Harris won every state where she currently leads in the polling averages, she would reach the necessary 270 electoral votes.That outcome is far from certain. Trump could easily take the presidency again if he gains ground in swing states - or if the polls are underestimating his support, as happened in the run-up to the 2016 and 2020 elections.The polls do seem to agree on one point: the US is heading for another closely contested presidential election.",
