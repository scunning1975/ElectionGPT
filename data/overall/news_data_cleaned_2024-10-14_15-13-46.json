    "title": "Your guide to the presidential candidates' views on abortion",
    "content": "Abortion rights, always a polarizing issue in American politics, became an electoral tinderbox in 2022 after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision to create a federal right to abortion access. Democrats have seized upon the issue of women's bodily autonomy, notably in the 2024 presidential election, in part because it could motivate the critical bloc of suburban women voters in swing states.The prospect of women not having access to abortion was theoretical in many voters' minds until the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which set in motion a domino effect of widely varying laws about abortion in the states. As of June, 14 states had enacted total bans on the medical procedure, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research organization that supports abortion access.Other states have enacted restrictions at various stages in pregnancy. The end result of all of the laws is many American women traveling to receive reproductive care, more than 171,000 in 2023, according to the institute. ProPublica reported on Sept. 16 that two Georgia women died after being unable to access legal abortion and timely medical care there, including a 28-year-old single mother who traveled to another state to obtain a prescription for a medical abortion, but then had rare complications because the fetal tissue was not fully expelled from her body.Care that is routinely provided in such situations was significantly delayed, resulting in Amber Nicole Thurman getting a sepsis infection that caused her blood pressure to plummet and her organs to fail, according to the ProPublica report. Twenty hours later, after doctors decided to operate, her heart stopped. A state committee focused on pregnancy-related fatalities concluded that her death was \"preventable.\"Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris weighed in the day after the report was published, saying that such tragedies are the direct result of former President Trump's Supreme Court appointees who voted to strike down Roe.\"This young mother should be alive, raising her son, and pursuing her dream of attending nursing school,\" the vice president said in a statement. \"In more than 20 states, Trump Abortion Bans are preventing doctors from providing basic medical care. Women are bleeding out in parking lots, turned away from emergency rooms, losing their ability to ever have children again. Survivors of rape and incest are being told they cannot make decisions about what happens next to their bodies. And now women are dying. These are the consequences of Donald Trump's actions.\"There have also been multiple reports of woman suffering miscarriages and other medical emergencies who struggled to get care.Republicans, including Trump, have claimed that Harris and running mate Tim Walz support allowing babies to be killed after they are born. Trump repeated that false assertion during the September presidential debate.\"It's an execution,\" Trump said, claiming that Democrats support allowing babies to be killed in the final months of pregnancy and after they are born.It is illegal to kill babies after they are born in every state, and extremely rare late-term abortions typically occur because the baby's health is severely compromised and the baby is not viable, or because of threats to the health of the woman.Abortions after 21 weeks, considered late-term pregnancies, account for less than 1% of abortions, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 80% of abortions occur in the first nine weeks of pregnancy, and 6% occur during the second trimester.In the aftermath of the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, questions immediately arose about whether Congress would enact legislation protecting abortion access across the nation or a federal measure prohibiting such rights.Trump has vacillated on whether or not he would sign a federal abortion ban, but he has said that he would support a federal prohibition after a certain length of pregnancy. The former president has also stated that Americans broadly support the issue being decided by the states, which is decisively refuted by all reliable public polling.\"Look, this is an issue that's torn our country apart for 52 years,\" Trump said during the debate. \"Every legal scholar, every Democrat, every Republican ... they all wanted this issue to be brought back to the states where the people could vote, and that's what happened.\"Each individual state is voting. It's the vote of the people,\" Trump said.Harris argues that Trump is untrustworthy on the issue, and she vocally supports federal legislation allowing abortions until a fetus could survive outside the uterus, and later if required for medical reasons. The first White House official to visit an abortion clinic, Harris has called Trump's actions on abortion \"unconscionable.\"\"It's insulting to the women of America,\" Harris said. \"Understand what has been happening under Donald Trump's abortion bans. Couples who pray and dream of having a family are being denied IVF treatments. What is happening in our country, working people, working women who are working one or two jobs who can barely afford child care as it is, have to travel to another state, to get on a plane, sitting next to strangers to go and get the healthcare she needs.\"A president's power to reshape the Supreme Court took on greater importance when Trump narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016. Senate Republicans refused to even consider President Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to fill the seat of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia after Scalia died in February 2016 -- nine months before the election.That set the stage for Trump to fill Scalia's seat and two others -- the last of his picks, Amy Coney Barrett, was confirmed just a week before the 2020 election -- paving the path to Roe being overturned, which the former president frequently boasts about.\"Now it's not tied up in the federal government,\" Trump said. \"I did a great service in doing it. It took courage to do it, and the Supreme Court had great courage in doing it, and I give tremendous credit to those six justices\" who voted to overturn the landmark abortion ruling.Harris has lashed out at Trump for appointing the justices who supported overturning federal protection for abortion rights.\"Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade -- and they did exactly as he intended,\" she said.",

    "title": "Why the presidential debate is a turning point for betting markets",
    "content": "The presidential debate is a pivotal moment in any U.S. election campaign. It's more than just candidates going head-to-head -- it's a showdown between them and the expectations of millions of voters.These debates can also shake up the political betting markets, particularly regarding the futures bet on the presidential election, where odds can shift dramatically depending on a candidate's performance.The presidential debates: Their powerOne of the few times candidates can directly communicate with millions of voters before election day in real time is in presidential debates. Debates are a critical turning point in many elections, both in terms of candidates shoring up the strengths of their campaigns or exposing their weaknesses. Voters want more than just policy details, they want to know how well a candidate will perform on the stage, in demeanor, on personality, and how well they can think on their feet. A debate performance can be a building block to a candidate's confidence or a source of doubt regarding a candidate's ability to lead.Fast forward to today's social media and real-time reaction era, debates have even more impact, especially when you bet on the election. For example, certain moments, whether gaffes, wit-filled answers, or policy turns, can spread like wildfire, influencing public opinion virtually in an instant. There is a lot at stake and one misstep during a debate can be a killer for a campaign.Political betting markets and how they are affected by debatesLike presidential polling, political betting markets respond to what happens in these debates. That has meant bettors and analysts watch debate performances looking for clues that could shift the 2024 presidential election odds. A good performance in the debate can help a candidate rise in the betting markets, while a bad performance can see their odds lose ground.The shifting odds reflect the changing dynamic of the race and often make it tougher for anyone making a futures bet on the presidential election because of the many factors leading up to the vote taking place.BetUS and other betting platforms are very close to all these changes and will keep it up to date with the latest odds, letting political bettors know how well each candidate performs in the debates, but also what the public and the media think about the performance.Factors that influence debate outcomesSeveral factors determine whether a candidate's debate performance will be seen as successful or damaging:Public perception: Policy points can matter less than how a candidate present themself. Specific policy details aren't necessarily what voters connect with; they respond more to confidence, poise, and a clear message.Memorable moments: A debate can be defined by gaffes or a standout moment. One-liners, or major missteps, can overshadow policy discussions and dominate the post debate conversation.Fact-checking: Fact-checking is now a critical part of how the public sees the world. If candidates are caught lying or making bogus claims and statements, they can be stomped on immediately by the voters and the media.Handling pressure: Debates are high pressure environments and candidates have to show they can take it; that they can answer tough questions, take personal attacks and unexpected developments in their stride without losing their cool.What it means in 2024This will be one of the most contentious and closely watched elections in recent history and will happen on a deeply polarized political landscape. Even after the most recent debates, early polling data and 2024 presidential election odds indicate it is going to be a highly-competitive race.",

    "title": "Venezuela: UN Rights Council Extends Probe as Crisis Deepens - Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)",
    "content": "Diplomatic Pressure Remains Essential Amid Post-Electoral Repression(Geneva) -The United Nations Human Rights Council, in extending its Venezuela probe, has sent a clear message to those responsible for ongoing abuses, including in the context of post-electoral repression, that they will be held to account, Human Rights Watch said today.On October 11, 2024, the council adopted a resolution extending the mandate of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission (FFM) on Venezuela for two years. The mission was among the first international bodies to assert that Venezuelan authorities have engaged in serious human rights violations that could amount to crimes against humanity. The resolution also asks the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue to monitor and report on the human rights situation in the country.\"The decision to extend the fact-finding mission's mandate is pivotal given the heightened post-electoral repression in Venezuela,\" said Juanita Goebertus, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. \"Through this resolution, council members have sent the message that they won't stand by as Maduro's forces kill and abuse people to stay in power and that they are committed to holding Venezuelan authorities accountable for their crimes.\"The Human Rights Council established the FFM in 2019 to investigate \"extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions and torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment since 2014,\" with a view to \"ensuring full accountability for perpetrators and justice for victims.\" Its mandate has been renewed twice, in October 2020 and October 2022.In September, 30 national and international organizations defending human rights in Venezuela, including Human Rights Watch, urged the council to renew the mandate of the FFM again this year.The resolution, presented by a group of regional governments -- Canada, Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Guatemala, Paraguay, and Uruguay -- was adopted by a vote of 23 to 6, with 18 abstentions. An increase in supportive votes compared to the last resolution in 2022 suggests growing international concern about the deepening rights crisis.This time, Cuba, Belarus, and Russia introduced hostile amendments that would have undermined the initiative, including amendments that, if adopted, would have terminated the Mission's mandate, labeled Venezuelans on the move purely as migrants and not refugees, and weakened the high commissioner's ability to provide timely updates on the developing human rights situation in Venezuela to the Council. Council members overwhelmingly voted to reject all these proposed amendments.This resolution also asks the mission to investigate repression following the July 2024 presidential election, including violence by pro-government armed groups known as colectivos.The resolution expresses alarm at \"worsening human rights violations and abuses and increasing restrictions of civic and democratic space, particularly in the presidential elections.\" It notes that a \"Venezuelan-led solution requires respecting the will of the Venezuelan people.\"On July 28, Venezuelans voted in the presidential election in large numbers, despite irregular government actions and human rights violations. International observers raised serious concerns about the announcement by Venezuela's electoral authority that Nicolás Maduro had been re-elected president.Following the announcement, thousands of protesters took to the streets in largely peaceful protests to demand a fair counting of the votes. People, including in low-income areas traditionally supportive of the Chavismo political movement from which Maduro emerged, protested in large numbers. Authorities responded with violence and widespread abuses, including killings, arbitrary detention and prosecution, and harassment of critics.Human Rights Watch received credible reports of 23 killings of protesters and bystanders and identified evidence linking security forces and colectivos with several of these killings. As of September 30, the local group Foro Penal reported 1,767 \"political prisoners\" who had been arrested since July 29, including 67 adolescents who remain behind bars.In its most recent report to the council, in September, the FFM said that following the elections, the government had \"reactivated and intensified the harshest and most violent mechanisms of its repressive apparatus,\" generating a \"widespread climate of fear among the population.\"The FFM concluded that they had reasonable grounds to believe that some of the violations they have investigated over the past year \"were committed following the same course of conduct that the mission qualified in previous reports as crimes against humanity.\" In previous reports, the mission has identified people \"at presidential and ministerial level,\" as well as \"the directors of the security and intelligence entities,\" who should be investigated for their criminal responsibility in that regard. It also consistently highlighted the judiciary's involvement and the state's repressive tactics targeting opposition members or those perceived as such, alongside the lack of real reform in law enforcement institutions.Following the adoption of this resolution, foreign governments should take further steps to support the Venezuelan people, Human Rights Watch said. The European Union and the US government should continue to use their leverage, including targeted sanctions, to press the Maduro government to respect the will of the people and human rights.The governments of Presidents Gustavo Petro in Colombia and Luíz Inacio Lula da Silva in Brazil should continue assertive efforts to urge Maduro to respect the will of the people, as expressed in the polls, and to respect human rights. They should also explore ways to encourage Maduro's international allies, including Cuba, to refrain from supporting repression.Governments should also support the ongoing investigation of the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court into crimes against humanity in Venezuela and ensure that the court has the resources it needs to support work across its docket. They should also expand access to asylum and other forms of international protection for Venezuelans leaving their country in line with international standards.",

    "title": "Kamala Harris Has a Plan for Black Men. Trump Never Did",
    "content": "\"Black Vote, Black Power,\" a collaboration between Keith Boykin and Word In Black,examines the issues, the candidates, and what's at stake for Black America in the 2024 presidential election.On Monday Kamala Harris unveiled a new agenda for Black men. The plan is extensive, but I want to highlight 10 specific steps she would take as president that would empower Black men with the tools we need to build wealth, provide for our families, and lead our communities.Number 1. Business Loans. Black Americans are twice as likely to be denied credit by banks, so Harris would provide 1 million fully forgivable loans of up to $20,000 to Black entrepreneurs and others who have historically faced barriers to starting a new business or growing an existing one.Number 2. More Jobs Without College Degrees. Harris would eliminate unnecessary degree requirements and promote pathways for those without college degrees for 500,000 federal jobs.Number 3. More Black Male Teachers. As a former high school English and social studies teacher, I know it's important for young Black males to see Black men in front of the classroom as role models and mentors. Only 1% of public school teachers are Black men, so Harris would create pathways for more Black men to become teachers, including apprenticeship programs and loan forgiveness.RELATED: Obama's Challenge to Black Men -- Don't Fall for Trump's LiesNumber 4. Health Care. My uncle, who had sickle cell disease, died last year, and I know several Black men my age who have been recently diagnosed with prostate cancer. And don't get me started on the mental health needs of the Black men in my family and community. I see it every day. We've been traumatized by an unfair criminal justice system and a world that demonizes us instead of understanding us. Fortunately, Harris would launch a National Health Equity Initiative focused on Black men that addresses sickle cell disease, diabetes, mental health, and prostate cancer.Number 5. Weed Equity. Black men have been disproportionately arrested and incarcerated for marijuana-related charges. Now that cannabis is becoming more socially acceptable and profitable, it's only fair that we benefit from the changing system that hurt us. Vice President Harris not only wants to legalize recreational marijuana but also create opportunities for Black Americans to succeed in this new industry.Number 6. Ban the Box. I have a law degree, and yet when I lived in Harlem, I was still stopped on the street, arrested, and locked up in jail. I know Black men have been targeted by a racist criminal justice system. Harris would work with Congress to require businesses to limit the unnecessary use of criminal arrest histories, convictions, and credit scores in employment decisions.RELATED: 10 Ways to Be a Better Black VoterNumber 7. Mentorship Programs. Harris would expand funding for community mentorship programs with a proven track record of helping young Black men succeed. She will also support programs like My Brother's Keeper.Number 8. Support Black Farmers. Harris would continue to support Black farmers and ranchers who have been denied access to capital. As vice president, she already distributed funding to thousands of Black farmers and ranchers in a $2 billion relief package.\nNumber 9. Relieve Medical Debt. My stepfather passed away in April 2020 , with a mountain of medical debt. Vice President Harris plans to work with states to relieve medical debt, which is the leading cause of bankruptcy in America, and disproportionately hurts Black Americans.And Number 10. Crypto Protection. More than 20% of Black Americans, including me, have owned cryptocurrency assets. I lost money in crypto, but the high-risk, high-reward crypto markets provide opportunities outside of the existing stock market for many Black men. A Harris administration would support a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency and other digital assets to protect Black men who invest in these assets.Question 1. Why didn't she do this in the last four years? Because she's not the president. She's the vice president. Trump was actually a president, and he did none of these things in his four years in office.Question 2. But why do some of these policies say Black men \"and others\"? Why aren't they all Black-specific? Well, because Trump's Supreme Court Justices and federal judges keep striking down programs that focus on Black people? Trump's Supreme Court ended race-specific affirmative action in college admissions. A Trump-appointed federal judge forced the Minority Business Development Agency to help white people. Another Trump-appointed federal judge blocked a disaster relief program for Black farmers. And two Trump-appointed federal judges in Georgia blocked a private program by the Fearless Fund to help Black women in business.RELATED: With a Trump Win, Republican Judges Will Rule the Courts -- and Our LivesIf Trump's judges won't allow a private group of Black women to help each other, do you think they're going to let a government program that only helps Black men and excludes others? No. But this is what happens when we don't vote. So we have to create clever ways to get around the Trump MAGA Republican bans on helping Black people.Question 3. Yeah, but why does it feel like Democrats only care about Black women? Yes, Joe Biden elevated two very prominent Black women in the past four years:VP Kamala Harris and Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. But the Democratic Party is filled with Black men in positions of power and leadership. The highest-ranking Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives is Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who will become the first Black Speaker if Democrats win the House in November. The highest ranking leader in the military is Lloyd Austin, the first Black Secretary of Defense. Two of the three Democratic Black U.S. senators -- Raphael Warnock and Cory Booker -- are Black men. The Democratic governor of Maryland, Wes Moore, is a Black man. The mayors of New York City, Chicago, and Atlanta are all Black men in the Democratic Party. And the only Black person ever elected president, Barack Obama, is also a Black man.And Question 4: But isn't Trump better for Black men? Was he better for Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, and Korey Wise -- the Exonerated Five teenagers who went to prison when Trump led a lynch mob against them for a rape they did not commit, and then refused to apologize after they were exonerated by DNA evidence? Was he better for the Black casino workers who sued him for racial discrimination? Was he better for Colin Kapernick and the NFL players he attacked for taking a knee? Was he better for Eugene Goodman, the Capitol Police Officer who had to fend off a mob of angry white Trump supporters who tried to take over the Capitol on January 6? Was he better for the Haitian American Black men in Springfield, Ohio, who were subjected to death threats because of Trump's lies about them eating dogs and cats? Was he better for Marcellus Williams, the Black man who was executed by the State of Missouri last month because Donald Trump's three Supreme Court Justices refused to agree with the Democratic Justices to stop the execution? Was he better for the Black farmers denied relief by his judges? Was he better for the Black men who died while he mismanaged the COVID pandemic? And will he be better for the Black youth who will be harassed by the police when he brings back stop and frisk?Kamala Harris wants to help Black men build wealth, provide for our families, and lead our communities. Trump wants to use us as political pawns in his angry MAGA campaign. Those are the choices. Choose wisely.Keith Boykin is a New York Times-bestselling author, TV and film producer, and former CNN political commentator.

    "title": "A devastating hurricane doesn't dramatically change how people vote - but in a close election, it can matter",
    "content": "North Carolina and Florida are changing administrative rules and, in some cases, issuing emergency funding that is intended to make it easier for people in areas damaged by Hurricanes Helene and Milton to vote.The recovery in both states is expected to extend far beyond the November 2024 election period. The majority of the people in the affected communities in North Carolina and Florida voted for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in 2020, making some election analysts wonder if some Trump supporters will be able to cast their ballots.Amy Lieberman, a politics and society editor at The Conversation U.S., spoke with Boris Heersink, a scholar of voters' behavior after a natural disaster, to better understand if and how the recent hurricanes could shift the results of the 2024 presidential election.A massive hurricane disrupts people's lives in many important ways, including affecting people's personal safety and where they can live. Ahead of an election, there are a lot of practical limitations about how an election can be executed - like if a person can still receive mail-in ballots at home or elsewhere, or if it is possible to still vote in person at their polling location if that building was destroyed or damaged.Another issue is whether people who have just lived through a natural disaster and will likely be dealing with the aftermath for weeks to come are focused on politics right now. Some might sit out the election because they simply have more important things to worry about.The other side of the equation, which is what political scientists like myself are mostly focusing on, is whether people take the fact that a natural disaster happened into consideration when they vote.Two scholars, Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels, have argued that sometimes voters are not great at figuring out how to incorporate bad things that happened to them into a voting position. In some cases, it is entirely fair to hold an elected official responsible for bad outcomes that affect people's lives. But at other moments, bad things can happen to us without that being the fault of an incumbent president or governor. And voters should ideally be able to balance out these different types of bad things - those it is fair to punish elected officials for, and those for which it isn't fair to hold them responsible.After all, a devastating hurricane is terrible, but it is not Kamala Harris' fault that it happened. But Achen and Bartels argue that voters frequently still punish elected officials for random bad events like this.Their most famous example is the consequences of a series of shark attacks off the New Jersey coast in the summer of 1916. As a result of those attacks, the New Jersey tourism industry saw a major decline. While these findings are still being debated, Achen and Bartels argue that Jersey shore voters subsequently voted against Woodrow Wilson in the 1916 presidential election at a higher rate than they would have had the shark attacks not happened. They argue that voters did this even though Wilson had no involvement in the shark attacks.Scholars like John Gasper and Andrew Reeves argue that voters mostly care whether elected officials respond appropriately to a disaster. So, if the president does a good job reacting, voters do not actually punish them at all in the next election. However, voters can punish elected officials if they feel like the response is not correct.The fact that Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana in 2005 was not the fault of then-President George W. Bush. But the perceived slowness of the government response is something a voter could have held him responsible for.Colleagues and I have shown that how people interpret the combination of a disaster and the government response is likely colored by their own partisanship.We looked at both the effects of Superstorm Sandy on the 2012 presidential election and natural disasters' impact on elections more broadly from 1972 through 2004. One core finding is that when presidents reject state officials' disaster declaration requests, they lose votes in affected counties - but only if those counties were already more supportive of the opposite party.If there is a strong positive government response, the incumbent president or their party can actually gain votes or lose voters affected by a disaster. So, Republicans affected by the hurricanes could become more inclined to vote against Harris if they feel like they are not getting the help they need. But it could also help Harris if affected Democrats feel like they are getting enough aid.The major takeaway is that if the government responds really effectively to a natural disaster or other emergency, there is not a huge electoral penalty - and there could even be a small reward.That is not irrelevant in a close election. If Republicans in affected areas in North Carolina feel the government response has been poor and it inspires them to turn out in higher numbers to punish Harris, that could matter. But if they feel like the response has been adequate, research suggests either no real effect on their support for Harris - or possibly even an increase in Harris voters.Scholars mostly assume that people affected can tell whether the government response was good or not. Trump and other Republicans are falsely saying that the response is slow and falsely claiming that Federal Emergency Management Agency money is being spent on immigrants who are not living in the country legally. There does not appear to be a slow government response to the hurricane in North Carolina, and there's no evidence the response is insufficient in Florida, either.So, the question now is whether voters affected by these hurricanes will respond based on their actual lived experiences, or how they are told they are living their experience.",

    "content": "Donald Trump raged about the new film \"The Apprentice\" on Monday, calling the movie a \"pile of garbage\" made by \"human scum.\"The former president and GOP presidential nominee was fired up in his early-morning Truth Social post, where he railed against the screenwriter, journalist Gabe Sherman, and hoped that the \"fake and classless\" film would be a box office bomb.\"It's a cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country,\" Trump wrote in his post, which has a time stamp of 12:48 a.m. EST.Directed by Ali Abbasi, \"The Apprentice\" stars Sebastian Stan as a young Trump making a name for himself as a New York real estate developer, with \"Succession's\" Jeremy Strong as his mentor Roy Cohn.Premiering at this year's Cannes Film Festival, the controversial biopic portrays Trump as an amphetamine-addled slumlord, and includes a scene where he rapes his first wife, Ivana Trump (played by Maria Bakalova).Appearing to dispute the depiction in his post, Trump called Ivana \"a kind and wonderful person,\" and said he \"had a great relationship with her until the day she died.\"Ivana Trump, a Czech model turned businesswoman, did use the word \"rape\" to describe an incident detailed in her and Donald's high-profile 1990s divorce case, but later recanted the allegation. She died in 2022.In his Truth Social post, Trump attacked Sherman as \"the writer of this pile of garbage\" and \"a lowlife and talentless hack, who has long been widely discredited.\" He said Sherman \"chose to ignore\" what he said were the facts about his and Ivana's relationship.\"So sad that HUMAN SCUM, like the people involved in this hopefully unsuccessful enterprise, are allowed to say and do whatever they want in order to hurt a Political Movement, which is far bigger than any of us,\" Trump wrote.The former president's legal team tried and failed to block the film's release earlier this year, leaving \"The Apprentice\" struggling to find a distributor in the U.S.And though he was unable to stop the film from hitting theaters, Trump appears to be getting his wish regarding the box office.\"The Apprentice\" opened on Friday to weak ticket sales, taking in a meager $1.6 million, according to The Associated Press.",

    "title": "Could massive Trump crypto best be a ploy to challenge 2024 results?",
    "content": "Less than a month out from the 2024 presidential election, polls are tight in the race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.But over on prediction markets, the gap between Harris and Trump widened recently. On Polymarket, a crypto-fueled offshore marketplace that offers bets on the presidential election, Trump has jumped out to a huge lead.Another market, Predictit, is favoring Trump as well, but by a narrower margin.Trump's massive lead on Polymarket has some convinced the site isn't running a crypto betting pool, but rather an election influence operation, setting the stage for Trump to take office regardless of the results in November.The market there shows a 55% chance he will win and a 44.6% chance Harris will lose. For each candidate, gamblers can buy \"yes\" or \"no\" votes based on who they think will win or lose.Those predictions have been boosted recently by conservative influencers online as proof that Harris' campaign is flailing.But some liberals are pushing back against Polymarket as \"proof\" of shifting voter sentiment, pointing to the fact that it was funded by a key Trump booster.In May, Polymarket announced it raised $70 million in two recent rounds of investment, with a big boost coming from Founders Fund, a venture capital outfit led by Trump 2016 backer Peter Thiel.Thiel has been a crucial funder of Trump's vice presidential pick Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) over the years. Vance worked for Thiel in 2017 and Thiel funded Vance's own firm Narya Capital in 2020. In 2022 Thiel donated $15 million to Vance's successful Senate race in Ohio.Thiel, who previously spoke out against democracy, has declined to publicly support any candidate in 2024. Vance reportedly has been pressuring him to donate to Trump.Online, some people are pointing to the jump in support for Trump on the prediction market as evidence that Polymarket might be putting a heavy finger on the scale to create a narrative of inevitability about Trump getting elected.Others say that even if the strategy doesn't result in a Trump victory, it could lay the seeds for a narrative that the election was rigged against Trump.\"Polymarket is owned by Peter Thiel,\" posted @Cmmnsensedspnsr on X. \"The same Peter Thiel who is personally backing JD Vance and many other conservative causes. Polymarket is not independent, not unbiased, and skewing its data to favor one person over another.\"\"connect the dots: GOP Russian link backer Peter Thiel funded Polymarket, which is banned in the US, and hired @NateSilver538 ahead of the election to create an 'alternate' narrative about election being widely favored 4 Trump. This narrative would then be picked up by right-wing,\" added @SomaliAmerica, referring to former FiveThirtyEight founder Nate Silver, who joined Polymarket in July.Silver has also been a left-wing boogeyman over the years and sparked ire earlier this summer when he released his new election model predicting Trump would win.Betting on elections is against the law in the United States, which is why Polymarket operates offshore. In 2022, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) fined Polymarket $1.4 million for operating illegal event markets.In 2023, some Democratic senators wrote a letter to the CFTC warning another prediction market called Kalshi could potentially impact the election.\"Billionaires could expand their already outsized influence on politics by wagering extraordinary bets while simultaneously contributing to a specific candidate or party,\" they predicted. \"These bets could sway the outcome of our elections, undermining the voices of voters. If citizens believe that the democratic process is being influenced by those with financial stakes, it may further exacerbate the disenfranchisement and distrust of voters already facing our nation.\"Volume on Polymarket for the election is over $1.8 billion, and a plurality of it is coming from the Trump side. Gamblers spent $500 million on votes on Trump, and just over $370 million on the Harris side.That's led some people to point to some of the biggest movers in the markets as potentially buying shares for Trump to distort the market in his favor. One user, Fredi9999, has over 14 million yes shares as of Monday afternoon.\"The user is a fervent and wealthy supporter, crypto & tech savvy, who wants to back up his belief that Trump will win with a lot of money,\" posted @Domahhhh last week about Fredi, when he had around 8 million shares.Wrote one about the numbers, \"This smells like desperation. A single whale can shift the odds dramatically on polymarket. They're simply laying the groundwork for another 'stolen election' narrative,\" they said, flagging Elon Musk's tweet that called Polymarket \"More accurate than polls.\"Others were similarly convinced that the market movement was part of a plot.\"Political betting markets have always been skewed to the right, but now the billionaires are actively manipulating them to create the illusion that Trump has a clear advantage so that they can claim that the election was 'stolen' cheated if/when he loses,\" posted @BostonJerry.But other posters were more sanguine and viewed the prediction narrative as a distraction.\"People need to get out and vote and not pay attention to this nonsense -- the veracity of their ✌🏽\"polling\"✌🏽 is beyond questionable,\" wrote @rwiley55.",

Emmy and Tony winner Jeremy Strong also stars as driven and vicious lawyer and political fixer Roy Cohn, who mentors him. Maria Bakalova, an Oscar nominee for Borat Subsequent Moviefilm, plays Trump's late ex-wife, Ivana Trump.Trump laid into the film and its makers in ad hominem attacks. He and his team have threatened legal action against The Apprentice before, saying the film \"is pure malicious defamation.\" The Apprentice includes a controversial scene in which Stan's Trump assaults Ivana both physically and sexually. (Per a divorce deposition acquired by the biographer Harry Hurt III, Ivana accused her ex-husband of raping her in 1989, but then walked back the claim in 1993, saying that she did not want the word \"rape\" to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense, and telling CNN in 2015 that a Daily Beast story about her earlier allegations was \"totally without merit.\")On Truth Social, Trump maintained that he and his late wife had a healthy relationship. \"My former wife, Ivana, was a kind and wonderful person, and I had a great relationship with her until the day she died,\" he wrote. He ended his screed with his familiar refrain: \"MAGA2024!\"",

    "content": "United States presidential election approaches, three recent national polls reveal a tightly contested race between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.As the 2024 United States presidential election draws closer, three recent national polls highlight a closely contested race between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.With just over three weeks remaining until Election Day, these surveys reveal a tightening competition. Trump is making notable gains against Harris, who replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee earlier this year.The polls indicate that the race between Trump vs. Harris is now within the margin of error, reflecting a shift in momentum that could play a crucial role in the final days of the campaign, as mentioned in a report by Fox News.Here's a closer look at the latest survey results and what they suggest about the current state of the race.A recent ABC News/Ipsos poll of likely voters shows a narrow lead for Harris, at 50% compared to Trump's 48%. This marks a significant shift from last month when Harris held a six-point advantage over Trump. The poll reflects the narrowing gap between the two candidates, with Trump gaining ground as the campaign enters its final phase.Similarly, an NBC News survey of registered voters nationwide reveals a dead heat between the two candidates, each with 48% support. This represents a reversal from the previous month when Harris held a five-point lead. The tight numbers suggest that Trump's support has solidified as Election Day approaches, especially among his core base.Also Read : Agatha All Along Episode 6: Release date and time for US & UK | What to expectMeanwhile, a CBS News/YouGov poll of likely voters gives Harris a slim three-point edge over Trump, at 49% to 46%. This is down from a four-point advantage just a month ago, indicating that the race remains extremely competitive, as mentioned in a Fox News reportThe departure of President Joe Biden from the 2024 race significantly altered the dynamics of the election. After a challenging debate performance against Trump in late June, Biden withdrew from the race, prompting a quick rally around Harris as the new Democratic standard-bearer.Her campaign saw an initial boost in enthusiasm, with increased fundraising and positive shifts in favorability ratings, allowing her to gain a lead over Trump.However, as the campaign transitioned from summer into fall, Harris's momentum has slowed. Her favorability ratings have slipped, and the perception of her candidacy as a continuation of the Biden administration has persisted among voters.This shift has coincided with a resurgence of support for Trump, particularly among Republican voters returning to their party's nominee.Political analysts are divided on whether Trump's recent gains indicate true momentum or if they reflect a natural closing of the gap as Election Day approaches.David Paleologos, Director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center, emphasized the need for more data before drawing firm conclusions. \"It could be momentum, or it could be the natural closing of the gap in a very polarized country,\" he explained.Also Read : Rising tensions between Biden's and Harris's teams weeks before U.S electionsRepublican pollster Neil Newhouse, known for his work on GOP presidential campaigns, highlighted the challenges facing Harris. He argued that Harris's campaign is at risk of losing its initial advantage, saying she is \"on the verge of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory\" as her image falters and Trump gains traction.While national polls are valuable in understanding the overall race, the outcome of the 2024 presidential election will ultimately hinge on a handful of key battleground states. States like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Georgia, which played decisive roles in President Biden's 2020 victory, are once again under the spotlight.Polls from these swing states suggest that the Trump vs. Harris contest is also extremely close in these critical areas.Is Kamala Harris losing among Black Men?As per latest reports, Harris support has lowered among Black men but she is still ahead of Trump.When is the US Polls 2024?US Elections 2024 will be held on November 5.",

    "content": "The Las Vegas Review-Journal has officially endorsed former President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, citing his strong policy achievements during his time in office. Despite acknowledging voter dissatisfaction with the current political landscape, the editorial board argues that Trump's accomplishments are too significant to overlook.In a statement published Sunday, the newspaper recognized the frustration many Americans feel with their presidential options but pointed to Trump's economic and foreign policy successes as key reasons for their endorsement.\"Although many voters are dissatisfied with their choices for president, the policy results of Donald Trump's years in office are too strong to ignore,\" the editorial declared. \"From job creation to national security, Trump delivered real results that benefited the nation.\"The Las Vegas Review-Journal, one of the largest and most influential newspapers in Nevada, has a history of leaning conservative. Still, its endorsement of Trump, despite his polarizing persona, highlights the enduring appeal of his policy record to certain voter segments.During his tenure, Trump's administration saw significant tax cuts, record-low unemployment rates prior to the pandemic, and trade deals like the USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement), which replaced NAFTA. These accomplishments were praised by the paper as examples of Trump's effectiveness as a leader.While some critics point to Trump's controversial rhetoric and divisive political style, the editorial board emphasized that voters should focus on the substance of his policies rather than the noise surrounding his personality.\"Trump's approach may not have always been conventional, but the results speak for themselves,\" the paper stated. \"His economic policies strengthened the country, and his foreign policy initiatives ensured that America remained a dominant global player.\"This endorsement comes at a crucial moment in the 2024 campaign, with Nevada positioned as a key battleground state. Trump's appeal to working-class voters and his promises to address economic challenges have resonated with many Nevadans, particularly in the Las Vegas area, which has seen fluctuating economic fortunes in recent years.Despite the paper's praise for Trump, it acknowledged the dissatisfaction many voters feel toward both major candidates. \"The electorate is tired of the political bickering and personal attacks that have dominated the national conversation,\" the editorial said. \"But when it comes to delivering tangible results, Donald Trump stands out.\"However, the endorsement is not without controversy. Many Trump critics argue that his leadership style has contributed to the nation's deepening political divisions and question his ability to lead the country toward unity. Still, the Review-Journal remains firm in its belief that his policies were effective and can be again.The endorsement concluded by urging voters to focus on policy outcomes over personalities as they head to the polls in 2024. \"America needs strong leadership, and Donald Trump has proven he can provide it,\" the paper declared. \"This election is about results, and his track record is impossible to ignore.\"As Trump continues to rally support across the country, the endorsement from the Las Vegas Review-Journal could play a pivotal role in swaying undecided voters in Nevada and beyond.",

It is often viewed as the final opportunity for voters to participate, with many having already voted through early voting or by mail.In some states, mail-in ballots must be received by Election Day to be counted, while in others, as long as the ballots are postmarked by this date, they can be counted if they arrive later.Out of 538 electoral votes from the 50 states and the District of Columbia, this year's election will hinge on seven key battleground states: Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, often regarded as the crucial \"final boss.\"Pennsylvania has played a pivotal role in recent elections.Eight years ago, it was the last state called for Republican candidate Donald Trump before his victory was sealed with Wisconsin in the early hours after Election Day. Four years later, Democratic candidate Joe Biden's narrow win in Pennsylvania -- by about 80,000 votes out of more than 6.8 million cast -- was decisive, occurring four days after the polls closed.Winning Pennsylvania provides a crucial advantage, making it a central focus in campaign strategies.Nearly all of the approximately 160 million ballots cast in this year's U.S. election will be paper-based, and the vast majority will be tallied using machines.Election officials stress the importance of these machines, noting that without them, hand-counting such a large volume of ballots would be much more time-consuming, significantly more expensive for taxpayers, and prone to human error, which would require additional time and resources to correct.Despite this, the desire for human oversight remains strong. In Georgia, for instance, a recent directive from the state's election board sparked controversy by requiring poll workers to hand-count the total number of ballots. This ongoing debate underscores the tension between the efficiency of machines and the public's desire for human involvement in maintaining election integrity.Election recounts can be triggered by law, requested by a candidate, or ordered by a court, but they rarely alter the final result. According to Deb Otis from the nonpartisan organization Fair Vote, \"Recounts typically shift only a very small number of votes.\"On average, recounts change the vote margin by just 0.03 percentage points, with the largest shift -- 0.11 points -- occurring in a 2006 Vermont state auditor race. In that case, a 137-vote lead for Republican Randy Brock flipped to a 102-vote win for Democrat Thomas Salmon after a recount.It has become increasingly uncommon to know the results of a presidential election on Election Day itself -- particularly on the East Coast. The extended counting process became more widespread following the contested 2000 presidential election, which took 36 days to resolve George W. Bush's victory in Florida through a Supreme Court ruling.In 2016, Trump wasn't declared the winner until 2:29 a.m. ET the day after Election Day. In 2020, Joe Biden's victory wasn't confirmed until the Saturday after Election Day, when he secured the necessary 270 electoral votes by winning Pennsylvania.This delay extends beyond presidential races. The large number of U.S. representatives from California -- where mail-in ballots can be counted for weeks after Election Day -- often prolongs the wait to determine which party will control the House of Representatives.As voting methods have changed, with more people opting for mail-in or early voting, waiting for final results has become the norm in U.S. elections, especially in close contests.",

    "content": "Vice President Kamala Harris will conduct her first-ever Fox News interview on Wednesday, which will be conducted by the network's chief political anchor, Bret Baier.The news of Harris's first sit-down interview with the network comes as the 2024 presidential election is in less than a month, with both candidates seeking to shore up their support ahead of Election Day. The interview will air on Fox News's Special Report with Bret Baier on Wednesday at 6 p.m. Eastern time, according to a news release from the network.Baier will conduct the interview in Pennsylvania, arguably the most sought-after state in the Electoral College.In recent weeks, both Harris and former President Donald Trump have conducted rallies and interviews, with Harris appearing on the Call Her Daddy podcast and doing a sit-down interview on 60 Minutes. Trump, meanwhile, has turned down the opportunity to do a 60 Minutes interview, instead doing interviews on The Hugh Hewitt Show and a number of other podcasts.On the same day of Harris's interview with Baier, Fox News will also air a town hall with Trump featuring a women-only audience, which will be moderated by network anchor Harris Faulkner. This town hall will be pretaped and air on Faulkner's show The Faulkner Focus at 11 a.m. ET.\nBoth Fox News and CNN have offered to host one more debate between the two presidential candidates, though the former president resoundingly rejected both offers, citing how early voting is already underway in a number of states. He also pointed to Harris's comment on The View talk show about how she would not have done anything differently over the last 3 1/2 years.Harris has argued that Trump's staff is the reason he will not do another debate, as his staff believes \"he's just not ready.\" Her attacks mirror the ones that Trump lobbed at President Joe Biden prior to suspending his reelection bid, which was preceded by concerns over Biden's mental fitness to continue serving as president.",

    "content": "Plan aims to protect crypto investors, faces criticism for narrow focus.Vice President Kamala Harris has unveiled a plan to support a cryptocurrency regulatory framework as part of her \"Opportunity Agenda for Black Men,\" signaling a potential shift in the Democratic approach to digital assets.What Happened: The proposal, released less than a month before the presidential election, acknowledges the growing importance of cryptocurrencies among Black Americans. According to Harris' team, over 20% of Black Americans currently own or have previously owned crypto assets.\"Vice President Harris appreciates the ways in which new technologies can broaden access to banking and financial services,\" the campaign stated in the plan.Harris' proposal aims to ensure that \"owners of and investors in digital assets benefit from a regulatory framework so that Black men and others who participate in this market are protected.\"This move aligns with Harris' broader economic vision, which she outlined in an 80-page plan last month. In that document, she expressed support for innovative technologies like AI and digital assets while emphasizing consumer and investor protection.It comes as polls between Harris and GOP candidate Donald Trump tighten and 66% of respondents in a CBS survey voice a pessimistic outlook for the country's direction.Read Also: Mark Cuban Questions Trump's Motive Behind WLFI Token Sale -- Former Prez Failed In The 'Bitcoin IQ Test,' Says Max KeiserWhy It Matters: The proposal has faced criticism from some industry leaders. Cleve Mesidor, founder of the National Policy Network of Women of Color in Blockchain, expressed concern about the narrow focus on Black men and the framing of their role in the crypto space.\"It is perplexing that the Harris-Walz policy team opted not to meet with diverse leaders in crypto, but instead is rolling out a policy that narrowly frames crypto around Black men only and proposes a regulatory framework limiting Black men to consumers instead of producers,\" Mesidor told The Block.As the election approaches, Harris' stance on crypto regulation could become a key differentiator in the race, especially given Trump's pledge to end what he calls an \"unlawful and un-American crackdown\" on the U.S. crypto industry.Harris' initiative comes at a crucial time as the 2024 presidential election looms. Her campaign has received significant support from the crypto community, including a $1 million donation in XRP from Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen.The election, featuring Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, presents a unique scenario for the cryptocurrency market. As Bitcoin remains stable despite the election's proximity, several analysts are predicting an imminent uptrend regardless of the outcome.Read Next:Mark Cuban To Replace Gary Gensler Under Harris Administration?

    "title": "'It's a Nail-Biter!' Nate Silver's Latest Poll Shows Harris with 51% Chance to Win, Donald Trump Grabs 275 Electoral Votes! - EconoTimes",
    "content": "Nate Silver's latest 2024 presidential election forecast paints a razor-thin race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. According to Silver's projections, Harris holds a slight edge with a 51% chance of winning, while Trump follows closely behind with a 49% chance, making it one of the closest election forecasts in recent history.Despite Harris' slight edge in the probability of winning, Trump leads in the projected electoral vote count, securing 275.5 votes to Harris' 262.5. The difference, though narrow, indicates that Trump could once again win the Electoral College while losing the popular vote -- an outcome reminiscent of his victory in 2016.The forecast, published on Silver's website, has sparked heated debates among political analysts and voters alike. Trump's lead in electoral votes suggests that he maintains strong support in key swing states that will ultimately decide the election. On the other hand, Harris' higher overall chances indicate that she could still win if the right combination of states swings in her favor.The forecast comes at a time when both candidates are gearing up for what is shaping up to be a highly contentious race. Trump, who remains a polarizing figure, has continued to rally his base with promises of economic reform and immigration crackdowns. Meanwhile, Harris has been working to solidify her position as the face of the Democratic Party, with a focus on social justice and economic equality.Nate Silver's model, which has a reputation for accurately predicting election outcomes, takes into account a wide range of factors, including polling data, historical trends, and voter demographics. Silver's latest projections indicate that while Trump has strong backing in states like Florida, Texas, and Ohio, Harris is performing well in key battleground states such as Pennsylvania and Michigan.Political analysts warn, however, that the race is far from over. With over a year until Election Day, voter sentiment can shift dramatically, particularly as debates, scandals, or new policy announcements unfold. Both campaigns are expected to pour significant resources into swing states, making every electoral vote critical.Trump's lead in the electoral count has sparked concerns among Democrats, many of whom remember the 2016 election, when Hillary Clinton won the popular vote but lost the presidency due to the Electoral College system. Harris' team is reportedly focusing on turning out voters in critical states, knowing that even a small shift could alter the election's trajectory.\"This is the closest we've seen,\" one analyst remarked, pointing to the razor-thin margins. \"It's a nail-biter, and both sides know it. The fight for every vote in swing states is going to be fierce.\"As the 2024 race continues to heat up, Silver's forecast serves as a reminder that the outcome is anything but certain. With just a small margin separating Harris and Trump, the next several months will be crucial in determining who will ultimately emerge victorious.",

    "title": "'Donald Trump Takes the Lead!' New Poll Shows Trump Surging Ahead of Kamala Harris in Crucial Battleground States - EconoTimes",
    "content": "A new general election poll conducted by HarrisX shows former President Donald Trump edging ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris in key battleground states. The poll, released on October 13, reveals that Trump holds 48% of voter support compared to Harris' 46%, a two-point lead that could have significant implications for the 2024 presidential election.The poll, which surveyed likely voters across critical battleground regions, highlights the narrow margin that separates the two contenders as the race intensifies. Trump's lead, though slim, signals his continued strength in states that will be crucial in determining the outcome of the next presidential election.The HarrisX poll shows that Trump has managed to gain momentum in these battlegrounds, solidifying his position among core Republican voters while making inroads with key independent groups. Despite ongoing legal challenges and controversies surrounding his previous administration, Trump's appeal to voters who prioritize issues such as the economy and immigration remains strong.This latest poll comes amid increased speculation about whether Vice President Harris will officially enter the race if President Joe Biden decides not to seek re-election. Harris has faced mixed approval ratings throughout her vice presidency, and this close polling result highlights the challenges she may face in a head-to-head contest against Trump.While Harris has made strides with key Democratic constituencies, including women and minority voters, her narrow gap with Trump in battleground states indicates a highly competitive race ahead. Democrats will need to rally significant support in these areas to close the gap and secure a victory.Political analysts note that these battleground states -- often including swing states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin -- have played a decisive role in previous elections, making them critical to the success of any candidate. In 2020, Biden managed to flip several of these states in his favor, but Trump's current lead suggests that the political landscape remains highly fluid.A two-point lead may not seem insurmountable for Harris, but it underscores the challenge she faces in uniting the Democratic base while appealing to swing voters in key regions. With the 2024 election still over a year away, both candidates will have ample time to court voters and shape their campaigns around the pressing issues of the day.As the poll results continue to reverberate, both Trump and Harris are likely to double down on their efforts to secure support in these crucial states. For Trump, this lead is a clear sign that his base remains energized and ready to back his return to the White House. For Harris, it's a signal that she must work to shore up her support among undecided voters and turn the tide in her favor.The race for the presidency is expected to remain competitive, and as this latest poll indicates, the path to victory will run through the battleground states once again.",

    "content": "Maronite Catholic priest recovering from injuries after attack at rectory in Philadelphia Home\"Local News\"What does the Catholic Church teach about lying? Local News What does the Catholic Church teach about lying? Catholic News Agency 2024-10-14 Catholic News Agency / October 14, 2024 / 0 0 Shares Facebook Twitter Pinterest WhatsAppBy Daniel PayneCNA Staff, Oct 12, 2024 / 06:00 amAs with any U.S. election season, the 2024 presidential election is filled with endless \"fact checks\" and accusations of falsehoods against various politicians. Separating lies from facts is ultimately up to the voter and lying may seem unimportant these days in the grand scheme of things, but what does the Catholic Church teach about it?Unsurprisingly, after 20 centuries, the Church has a lot to say about lying, one of the most common phenomena of the human experience.One of the Ten Commandments is \"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor\" and the Catechism of the Catholic Church states: \"Lying is to speak or act against the truth in order to lead someone into error\" (No. 2483).\"By injuring man's relation to truth and to his neighbor, a lie offends against the fundamental relation of man and of his word to the Lord,\" the catechism continues.The catechism notes in No. 2484 that a lie's severity \"is measured against the nature of the truth it deforms\" and that one must consider \"the circumstances, the intentions of the one who lies, and the harm suffered by its victims.\" A lie that constitutes a venial sin \"becomes mortal when it does grave injury to the virtues of justice and charity.\"Some of the Church's most towering thinkers have similarly condemned lying. St. Thomas Aquinas said lying was \"directly and formally opposed to the virtue of truth.\"St. Augustine, meanwhile, argued that \"whoever shall think there is any sort of lie that is not sin, will deceive himself foully, while he deems himself honest as a deceiver of other men.\"There seems to be little disagreement among moral authorities as to the wrongness of lying in general. But there has been some debate as to whether or not some types of falsehoods can be justified in certain circumstances, such as when telling some or all of the truth would bring about unjust harm against innocents.One fabled example concerns St. Athanasius, who legend has it was rowing away from his persecutors on a river. When he encountered a group of searchers who asked if he knew where Athanasius was located, he reportedly responded: \"He's not far away!\" after which he was able to flee.Other examples involve similarly extreme circumstances, such as if a murderous villain demands to know the location of an innocent person he intends to kill.Patrick Lee, a professor of philosophy at Franciscan University of Steubenville in Ohio, told CNA: \"My view is that St. Thomas and St. Augustine and the catechism are right, that all lying is wrong.\"He acknowledged that there are \"difficulties\" in that prohibition, such as the famous example of someone hiding Jewish refugees in their home and having to respond to Nazis searching for them.Still, \"the rules are really, really clear in Scripture,\" he argued. He cited Jesus' sharp words in John 8 in which Christ points out that Satan \"does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him,\" that in lying the devil \"speaks according to his own nature,\" and that he \"is a liar and the father of lies.\"\"It really does sound like you have an obligation to the truth,\" Lee said. Satan, he argued, \"is the source of lying -- all lying.\"Nevertheless, there have been attempts among Catholic thinkers over the years to justify some forms of lying or dishonesty. The Jesuits many years ago popularized the practice of \"mental reservation,\" a controversial philosophical principle that critics have argued is tantamount to lying.Jimmy Akin, a senior apologist at Catholic Answers, told CNA that when practicing mental reservation, \"one says something that is technically true but withholds or reserves part of the truth.\"\"On the basis of this partial disclosure of truth, the person to whom one is speaking may draw an incorrect conclusion, but one would not have said something technically false and thus not lied,\" he said.An example of mental reservation could be when an abusive husband demands to know where his wife is hiding. The woman's protector might respond, \"I have not seen your wife,\" while thinking to himself, \"...in the last 30 seconds.\"\"The concept of mental reservation has been criticized on the ground that many mental reservations involve telling a truth in a deliberately misleading way and thus involve deliberate deception, making them functionally equivalent to lying,\" Akin said.Akin noted that in recent years some Catholic moral theologians \"have been exploring other theories that seek to balance the importance of truth-telling with the seeming practical need to use deception in some circumstances.\"\"This may be in part a response to the totalitarian regimes that arose in the 20th century and the need to deceive them in order to protect human life,\" he said.The idea of using falsehoods to save innocent victims from violent aggressors received renewed attention several years ago when Pope Francis admitted that, as a young priest in Argentina, he participated in what it could be argued were false and duplicitous actions as part of efforts to work against the dictatorship there.Akin wrote in 2013 that the faithful should be \"cautious of drawing implications from this,\" in part because \"people can and do make mistakes.\" Additionally, at the time, Francis \"was not yet pope and did not have the responsibility and the graces of that office.\"He pointed out to CNA, however, that at one point the Catechism of the Catholic Church qualified its prohibition on lying: It previously held that \"to lie is to speak or act against the truth in order to lead into error someone who has the right to know the truth.\" The \"right-to-know\" proviso was removed in 1997.\"To my knowledge, the Holy See didn't comment on the reason for the change,\" Akin said, \"but it presumably was to avoid adopting one, specific, recent theory of lying when others were still legitimate also.\"The older directive \"seemed to support a theory in moral theology that would permit lying in cases where the person had no right to know the truth, such as in the famous example of lying to Nazis about the location of hidden Jewish individuals,\" Akin said.Lee said lying represents a fundamental betrayal of the person to whom you are telling the falsehood.\"You're inviting someone to trust you that what you're saying is in your mind,\" he said. \"So you, in a way, betray that trust. You ask them to believe you in the sense that what you're saying is what you think. You're presenting a false self and blocking community with them.\"Akin, meanwhile, pointed out that \"historically, the most prominent view has been the one supported by St. Thomas Aquinas.\"\"He held that lying is intrinsically wrong as a perversion of the human faculty of speech, which he saw as oriented toward communicating truthful information in a way that would preclude lying,\" Akin said.\"On his view, lying is never permissible, and so one could not lie to Nazis about hiding Jews in one's attic. One would have to do something else.\"\"Examples of things a non-exception-making Thomist might do include shutting the door in the Nazis' faces without saying anything or using a mental reservation of some kind,\" he said.\"The difficulty for the Thomist,\" Akin pointed out, \"is finding something that would be effective (if you shut the door, the Nazis may just kick it in and search the house) and that would not involve deliberate deception (as many mental reservations do).\"Tags:Daniel PayneTen Commandments Previous post Voting with our Faith Next post This is the most recent story.

It turned into a campaign promo for Donald Trump when Bill referenced the murder of nursing student Laken Riley. José Antonio Ibarra, a 26-year-old Venezuelan illegal alien, has been charged with her murder.\"You had a case in Georgia not very long ago. They made ad ad about a young woman who had been killed by an immigrant. Yeah, well, if they had all been properly vetted, that probably wouldn't have happened,\" Clinton told the audience.It doesn't take a political science expert to know that Bill is aiming that remark straight at Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.\"But if they are properly vetted and that doesn't happen - America's not having enough babies to keep our population up, so we need immigrants that have been vetted to do work - there wouldn't be a problem,\" Clinton continued.In the latest Gallup poll, voters still say the economy is the number one issue in the 2024 presidential election. 45% say that terrorism and national security are \"extremely important\" issues in the upcoming election. 41% say immigration is extremely important.Who do voters think would solve the immigration issue?Trump holds a nine-percentage point lead (54-45%) over Harris on this issue with voters.Meanwhile, you have former President Bill Clinton saying the same thing outloud with cameras rolling.

A survey conducted from October 4 to 8 by ABC in collaboration with Ipsos indicates that Harris is leading Trump by 2 percentage points.The 2024 US presidential election is scheduled for November 5. Initially, the Democratic Party was set to be represented by current President Joe Biden. However, after a poor performance in the June debate against Trump, pressure mounted within the Democratic ranks for Biden to step aside. On July 21, Biden announced his decision to withdraw from the race, endorsing Harris as the Democratic nominee. Her candidacy was subsequently ratified by delegates during the Democratic National Convention held in Chicago.As the election date draws near, both candidates face a tight race, with opinion polls and betting markets painting a picture of a highly competitive campaign.",

    "title": "Trump faces third assassination attempt in California - BLiTZ",
    "content": "In a events on October 12, law enforcement officers in Coachella, California, arrested a man outside a rally for former US President Donald Trump, foiling what authorities have described as a third assassination attempt on the life of the Republican frontrunner.The suspect, Vem Miller, a 49-year-old Las Vegas resident, was found in possession of a loaded handgun, a shotgun, and a high-capacity magazine, raising concerns about the safety of political figures in an increasingly polarized nation.The Riverside County Sheriff's Office revealed in a statement on October 13, that Miller had been apprehended at a checkpoint near the rally venue. Miller had attempted to pass through security by presenting fake VIP and press credentials, which immediately aroused suspicion. Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco emphasized that Miller's counterfeit press passes were unusual enough to prompt immediate action from law enforcement. \"We probably stopped another assassination attempt,\" Bianco told The Press-Enterprise, noting that Miller's possession of illegal firearms added weight to the alarming situation.Miller has been described by authorities as a \"sovereign citizen,\" a term used to identify individuals who belong to an anti-government movement that rejects the authority of federal, state, and local laws. These individuals often assert that they are not subject to government jurisdiction, leading them to ignore legal standards and regulations.Sheriff Bianco also revealed that Miller is a registered Republican with an educational background that includes a master's degree from the University of California, Los Angeles. In 2022, Miller ran unsuccessfully for the Nevada State Assembly. However, at this time, it remains unclear whether his political affiliation or extremist ideology motivated the apparent assassination attempt on Trump's life.Miller was subsequently released on $5,000 bail after being charged with illegal firearms possession. While authorities have refrained from explicitly stating that Miller intended to assassinate Trump, Sheriff Bianco has indicated that the circumstances suggest otherwise. Miller himself has neither confirmed nor denied any such intent. The investigation into the suspect's motives is ongoing, but Miller is scheduled to appear in court in January to face charges.This incident marks the third assassination attempt targeting Donald Trump in recent months, underscoring the unique dangers faced by the former president as he campaigns for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. In July, Trump narrowly avoided death at a rally in Pennsylvania when a sniper fired a shot that grazed his ear from a distance of 150 meters. Tragically, the shooter managed to kill one attendee and injure two others before being neutralized by Secret Service agents. The Pennsylvania incident sparked serious concerns about the preparedness and efficacy of Trump's security team, especially after it was revealed that the rooftop from which the gunman fired had been left unprotected by the Secret Service.A second attempt on Trump's life occurred in September at his West Palm Beach golf course in Florida. A gunman who had hidden behind a bush reportedly aimed at Trump but was spotted by Secret Service agents. The assailant fled the scene but was arrested shortly afterward. Authorities identified the suspect as Ryan Wesley Routh, an American citizen who had allegedly tried and failed to join the Ukrainian military in 2022. After his unsuccessful recruitment efforts, Routh reportedly devised a scheme to recruit former Afghan commandos to fight for Ukraine, raising questions about his political motivations and potential foreign ties.The persistent threats against Trump have prompted an outpouring of concern from his supporters and Republican officials, many of whom believe that foreign adversaries are actively plotting to assassinate the former president. US intelligence agencies have suggested that Iran, in particular, may be seeking to assassinate Trump as retaliation for the US killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike ordered by Trump in 2020. In response to these threats, President Joe Biden has taken the unusual step of warning Tehran that any attack on Trump would be treated as an act of war, signaling the gravity of the situation.Amidst the heightened security concerns surrounding Trump, Republican Representative Matt Gaetz recently claimed that multiple assassination teams are actively plotting to kill the former president. In a controversial interview with Breitbart News, Gaetz alleged that at least five assassination teams are currently operating within the US, with three of them reportedly linked to Iran, Pakistan, and Ukraine. While these claims have not been verified by law enforcement or intelligence agencies, they have fueled a growing narrative among some Republicans that Trump is being targeted by foreign actors intent on destabilizing the country.Adding to the swirling conspiracy theories, Gaetz also floated the possibility that a mole within the Secret Service could be leaking sensitive information to Trump's would-be assassins. This theory, though speculative, has gained traction among certain factions of Trump's base, who view the repeated assassination attempts as part of a broader conspiracy to eliminate Trump and undermine his political aspirations.The Secret Service has not commented directly on Gaetz's allegations but has reaffirmed its commitment to protecting Trump with the highest level of security possible. President Biden, despite his political rivalry with Trump, stated on Friday that he had ordered the Secret Service to afford Trump the same level of protection as if he were a sitting president. The Biden administration has reportedly granted Trump's campaign the freedom to request whatever security assistance they deem necessary.As Donald Trump continues his campaign for a second term in office, the escalating threats against his life raise serious questions about the safety of political leaders in the US The sharp increase in political violence and assassination attempts against high-profile figures has stirred fears of further unrest as the 2024 presidential election draws closer.For now, Trump remains undeterred by the risks, pressing forward with his rallies and public appearances. But with three assassination attempts already foiled, it is clear that the political climate in America has reached a dangerous tipping point, where the line between political dissent and violence is becoming increasingly blurred. The challenge for law enforcement and the Secret Service will be ensuring that political candidates-regardless of party-are protected from those who seek to silence them through violence.",

    "title": "Gabriel Sherman, Who Trump Calls a \"Lowlife and Talentless Hack,\" Opens Up About Writing 'The Apprentice'",
    "content": "Jake Paul Hits Back: How a Fallen YouTube Star Found Redemption in the RingDonald Trump has finally weighed in on The Apprentice, the indie biopic in cinemas this weekend that traces the rise of the future 45th president (played by Sebastian Stan) in the New York real estate world of the 1980s via the help of pitbull lawyer Roy Cohn (Jeremy Strong).Let's just say he isn't thrilled with it.\"A FAKE and CLASSLESS Movie written about me, called, The Apprentice (Do they even have the right to use that name without approval?), will hopefully 'bomb,'\" Trump posted Sunday night on Truth Social. \"It's a cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country, 'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!'\"Trump's broadside also referenced the film's depiction of his late, ex-wife Ivana (played by Maria Bakalova). In one shocking Apprentice scene, Trump rapes Ivana on the floor of their home. (The scene is based on a divorce deposition which Ivana later disavowed.)\"My former wife, Ivana, was a kind and wonderful person, and I had a great relationship with her until the day she died. The writer of this pile of garbage, Gabe Sherman, a lowlife and talentless hack, who has long been widely discredited, knew that, but chose to ignore it. So sad that HUMAN SCUM, like the people involved in this hopefully unsuccessful enterprise, are allowed to say and do whatever they want in order to hurt a Political Movement, which is far bigger than any of us. MAGA2024!\" he wrote.Trump's wishes for a \"hopefully unsuccessful enterprise\" may have come true, as The Apprentice, which faced a long and rocky road to distribution -- including a cease-and-desist attempt from Trump -- sputtered in its opening weekend at the box office. Released by Tom Ortenberg's Briarcliff Entertainment, the film earned $1.6 million from 1,740 screens, just barely cracking the top 10.Screenwriter Sherman, 45, spoke to The Hollywood Reporter just a few days before the film's release -- and before Trump's insults.You've done what many journalists have always dreamed of doing: You're a produced screenwriter.This movie has lived and died so many different lives that I didn't even believe it was going to get made until the first day of principal photography. Shortly before production, it looked like we weren't even going to meet payroll and the movie was going to fall apart. So I never took anything for granted with this movie.Was this your first stab at screenwriting?It was my first feature. When I came up with the idea for the film in the spring of 2017, I was adapting my Roger Ailes biography into a limited series at Showtime that starred Russell Crowe. So I was starting to work in television at the time, but really I had no experience writing a feature film. I was learning as I go.Did you report the screenplay?I did. I read everything I could about Donald Trump and Roy Cohn and New York City in the 1970s and '80s. And then I went out interviewing people who knew Donald and Roy during those years and asked them for more anecdotes. So it was a mix of historical research plus my own interviewsI guess I was first introduced to Roy Cohn through Angels in America. He's such a fascinating, complex, contradictory figure in American history. What's your take on him?Well, I kind of feel bad admitting this, but there was a huge gap in my cultural education in that I had not seen Angels in America or read the play prior to writing this screenplay. My knowledge of Roy Cohn was really through journalism and writing about Donald Trump and knowing the influence that Roy had on Trump. And the version of Roy that I wanted to write was a quieter, more contained version with more menace.What drives him? Is he evil?I think there's a deep nihilism at the core of Roy Cohn's personality. I think it can manifest as evil, but I don't think he is evil per se. I think he became evil because he hated himself so much. There's a humanity that is so deep inside Roy that it's hard to see, but I try to find it as a writer. I try to find the humanity even in the monsters. I find part of the reason our culture is so polarized as we stop trying to understand people that we might disagree with.Roy grew up at a time when it was impossible to be openly gay person and want to have a successful career. He had to destroy a side of himself that I think made him feel a nihilism. The world was so unfair that it could justify anything. And so I think he rationalized his behavior, which was a complete lack of morality, because he felt that the whole world is fucked. \"The world is fucked up. So it doesn't matter if I break the rules.\" I think that's a tragedy. I think there's a tragic element to Roy Cohn that I think the movie explores, and Jeremy Strong's performance is so brilliant.Both Cohn and Trump are two of the most vilified and loathed figures in American history. And yet I found myself being sympathetic to both of them in certain scenes. Were you worried at all that you were humanizing them too much?I can only write what feels true to me. So when I was writing the script, I was just writing these characters that felt true to the research that I had done. It's a love story. Roy loved Donald on multiple levels. There's a father-son dynamic to their relationship. I also think there's a homoerotic undercurrent to their relationship. One of the things I came across in my research was that a lot of Roy's boyfriends -- starting with Russell Eldridge, who's portrayed in the movie -- were blonde, blue-eyed, all-American-looking young men. I was struck by the similarities between them and young Donald Trump. I think Roy was in love with Trump. There's no evidence that he ever acted upon it.Let's talk about Apprentice director Ali Abbasi's interpretation. I saw someone compare this film to Scarface. There's definitely a kind of gonzo, over-the-top approach to the material. This is not a dry biopic.When I wrote the film, my inspiration wasn't biopics per se, but the classic movies of New York cinema. I wanted it to feel like a New York movie. Midnight Cowboy or Dog Day Afternoon, obviously The Godfather, The French Connection and Taxi Driver. I think Ali had this brilliant idea that he wanted the film to expose a system of corruption that was unique to American culture. One of his references was Barry Lyndon. He loves Kubrick, and he talked a lot about young Donald Trump being a character like Barry Lyndon. And the other thing we talked about was that this movie has a Boogie Nights energy to it.So the film premieres at Cannes and right away Trump's people start attacking and threatening lawsuits. What was that experience like?Trump's campaign sent us the cease and desist letter a day after the premiere. But they released a statement the night of the premiere saying, \"It's all lies, and we're going to sue.\" That's life imitating art. In the movie, Roy Cohn tells Trump that his number one lesson is to attack. So what do they do? They go on the attack. To my knowledge, no one had seen the film, and Trump himself to this day has not seen the movie, even though we've offered to screen it for him.And we've talked about Jeremy Strong, but we haven't spoken about Sebastian Stan, who I think does a really brilliant job of evoking him but not mimicking him. Who was in your mind when you were writing?I didn't have a specific actor in mind, per se, but I was disappointed because early in the casting, we did go out to some top actors who will remain nameless, who passed on the role. They all want to work with Ali. But some of them said, \"I can't play Trump. It's too risky.\" Or, \"I don't want to give my humanity to Trump, but Ali, I want to work with you on your next film.\" In 2019, Sebastian read the script and was immediately intrigued by the role. And he and I had dinner in New York and talked about it, and he was obviously nervous about playing Trump, but he did something that is a miracle.My fear was that this role would become just the two hour version of Saturday Night Live. And what Sebastian pulled off is, I can't even explain how he did it, but it's not an impersonation. As you said earlier, I felt like I was in the presence of Trump.",

    "title": "'We Need Donald Trump Back!' National Border Patrol Council Endorses Former President, Says Only He Can 'Secure Our Borders' - EconoTimes",
    "content": "The National Border Patrol Council (NBPC), the union representing nearly 18,000 Border Patrol agents, has officially endorsed former President Donald Trump for the 2024 presidential election. The announcement signals a major endorsement from a key law enforcement group that has been a staunch supporter of Trump's hardline immigration policies during his time in office.In a statement released on Wednesday, NBPC President Brandon Judd praised Trump for his unwavering support of Border Patrol agents and his dedication to securing the U.S.-Mexico border, calling him the only candidate capable of addressing the current border crisis. \"We need Trump back,\" Judd said. \"Under his leadership, we had the most secure border in our nation's history. It's time to return to that level of commitment to the safety and security of the American people.\"The endorsement, which comes as the 2024 presidential race heats up, highlights the continued support Trump enjoys among law enforcement groups, particularly those focused on immigration and border security. The NBPC previously endorsed Trump in both the 2016 and 2020 elections, citing his strong border enforcement policies, including the construction of a border wall and stricter immigration controls.The union's endorsement was not without controversy, as Trump's policies, such as family separations and detaining asylum seekers, have drawn criticism from human rights organizations and Democratic lawmakers. Nonetheless, NBPC leaders argue that Trump's measures were necessary to combat illegal immigration and protect American citizens.\"He's the only candidate who understands what's truly happening at our border,\" Judd continued. \"The situation is worse than ever, and we need a leader who is committed to fixing it. President Trump did it once, and we know he can do it again.\"The endorsement comes as the U.S. continues to grapple with a surge in migrants at the southern border. Critics of the current administration, including Trump, have blamed President Joe Biden for what they describe as a \"border crisis,\" citing record numbers of illegal crossings and overwhelming strain on Border Patrol resources. The NBPC's support for Trump underscores the belief among many agents that his policies were effective in reducing illegal immigration.Trump responded to the endorsement with a statement thanking the NBPC for their continued support. \"I am honored to have the endorsement of the National Border Patrol Council once again,\" he said. \"Our brave Border Patrol agents are the frontline defenders of our nation, and they know that under my leadership, America had the strongest, safest border policies. Together, we will restore law and order at our borders and keep our country safe.\"While Trump remains a polarizing figure in American politics, his appeal to law enforcement and conservative voters remains strong, particularly on issues of immigration and border security. His endorsement from the NBPC could boost his campaign as he seeks to regain the presidency in 2024.As the race moves forward, border security is expected to be a central issue in the campaign, with Trump positioning himself as the candidate most capable of handling the ongoing challenges at the southern border.The NBPC's endorsement is likely to further energize Trump's base of supporters, particularly those who view immigration and border control as critical issues in the upcoming election. Whether it will sway undecided voters or change the course of the race remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Trump has the backing of those on the front lines of border enforcement.",

    "content": "You can opt-out at any time by visiting our Preferences page or by clicking \"unsubscribe\" at the bottom of the email.Director Ali Abbasi's \"The Apprentice\" presents a dramatized origin story for Donald Trump (played by Sebastian Stan), who, in the span of a few decades, goes from a nobody to a New York real-estate tycoon under the guidance of his lawyer, Roy Cohn (Jeremy Strong).Though the movie doesn't delve into Trump's political aspirations -- it ends right when author Tony Schwartz begins to discuss ghostwriting the 1987 book \"The Art of the Deal\" with Trump -- we see how the main lessons from Cohn would be Trump's guiding principles through his career and into his presidency, including attack, attack, attack; deny everything, admit nothing; and always claim victory.That \"always claim victory\" rule came into play during the 2020 presidential election. After his loss, Trump maintained that the election was stolen from him and that he'd actually won over Joe Biden.Soon after, Pro-Trump insurrectionists attacked the US Capitol in an attempted coup on January 6, 2021, that left four dead. Trump has denied responsibility for the January 6 insurrection and publicly condemned it as a \"heinous attack\" that left him \"outraged by the violence, lawlessness, and mayhem.\"The 2024 presidential election, in which Trump seeks to reclaim the presidency against Vice President Kamala Harris, is now less than a month away.The question of whether Trump will accept the results of this election remains unclear. In May, Trump said he'd accept the results if \"everything's honest.\" A month later, at the first debate with President Joe Biden, he was unwilling to say if he would accept the results or not. In August, he told CBS News he would accept the results if they were \"fair and free.\"In a recent interview promoting \"The Apprentice,\" Abbasi, who has been studying Trump since he signed on to make the film in 2018, weighed in on whether he believes Trump will accept the results in the event of a loss.\"I saw, like everyone else, what happened on January 6, which was horrific,\" he told Business Insider. \"And I have a feeling that a lot of people got away with insane stuff. Look at that footage.\"\"When you see that, you think, why would they change their opinion about this election? Why would they magically accept this when they didn't accept that?\" Abbasi continued.\"But somehow, I'm an optimist,\" he added. \"I was optimistic when people told me not to do this movie, or when people said no one would buy this movie. So, I really hope that everyone learned their lesson on January 6th. I hope to think that even though people may be tempted to do that again, they know what the consequences are, and they don't do it.\"In August 2023, Trump was indicted on four charges in connection to January 6, including conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction or an attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights. A year later, the four counts were revised to remove some of the alleged conduct that may now be protected by presidential immunity. Trump has pleaded not guilty.After interviewing Abbasi, Business Insider reached out to Trump for comment. A spokesperson for the former president slammed the movie.\"This 'film' is pure malicious defamation, should never see the light of day, and doesn't even deserve a place in the straight-to-DVD section of a bargain bin at a soon-to-be-closed discount movie store,\" Trump communications director Steven Cheung said in a statement. \"It belongs in a dumpster fire.\"",

There was no aspirational pieces...and Sali gets all these amazing people together and we all get to hang out.\"Guests mingled over sparkling wine, tuna tartare and caviar appetizers before sitting down for a dinner of Dover sole in the historic building built in 1928 by Charlie Chaplin, before it turned into a restaurant.\"Thank you for allowing us to feature you over the years,\" Christeson told the crowd during her toast, referring to the brand's editorials featuring prominent women. \"The goal for tonight is to connect women who wouldn't connect otherwise...and hope something magical comes from that.\"Argent's speciality pants suits were the uniform for the evening, seen on Oakland retailer Sherri McMullen, fashion consultant Laura Brown, former First Lady Michelle Obama's stylist Meredith Koop and more.Several women wore hot pink suits in a nod to Argent's #VotingSuitsYou campaign, which kicked off Oct. 1 to mobilize voter awareness for the 2024 presidential election in partnership with Obama's nonpartisan voting organization When We All Vote, which was a topic at dinner.\"We want to change the culture around voting, and one of the ways we do that is through partnerships like this....We're 25 days away from the election and we have work to do. You all have platforms to remind to register and get out the vote,\" said Beth Lynk, When We All Vote's executive director, in a pink suit herself. \"We're hosting parties in polling locations, and just like tonight we know there is an opportunity when we come together as community for action...to support women, lift up women and ultimately vote for women in this election.\"",

    "content": "With battleground state 2024 polls showing an extremely close race, both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are looking for the edge that will help them over the finish line first on Election Day.After winning the endorsement and support of former third-party candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump is poised to add a majority of his backers, according to a new survey provided to Secrets.The groups that polled for and backed Kennedy, American Values '24 and John Zogby Strategies, released a survey that said Trump holds a 22-point lead over Harris among Kennedy's supporters.In five of the six battleground states, Kennedy supporters prefer Trump over Harris by 20 points to 39 points.\"This means that the Kennedy Cohort will play a decisive factor in determining the eventual winner of the 2024 presidential election,\" said a Kennedy associate.In August, Kennedy dropped out of the presidential race and said he had no clear path to victory. At the time, some 7% of voters supported his campaign, according to the Pew Research Center.He then endorsed Trump's candidacy and has indicated he would accept a key position in a second Trump administration.In choosing to back Trump, Kennedy rejected his family's Democratic Party legacy after they spent much of the campaign criticizing him as a gadfly and spoiler. Liberals also mocked Kennedy's questioning of COVID-19 policies.\"This comprehensive poll shows RFK Jr. continues to play a major role in our political landscape after suspending his one-and-a-half-year tenure in the thick of the political arena,\" said Jeremy Zogby, managing partner of John Zogby Strategies.\"Democrat-leaning journalists have asked me how they could pick up a critical mass of his support. I tell them they should start by taking Kennedy more seriously. The DNC may have made a big mistake by not taking him more seriously,\" he told Secrets.In the new John Zogby Strategies survey, 56% of Kennedy's supporters backed Trump, while Harris won 34%. A third of Kennedy's backers were \"not yet voting for Trump\" but would be \"open\" to supporting him.While this might not have a big impact nationally, it does in the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.SEE THE LATEST POLITICAL NEWS AND BUZZ FROM WASHINGTON SECRETSAV24 and John Zogby Strategies provided Secrets with a graphic showing that \"bump\" of support:",

    "title": "Harris-Trump polls tighten, but PredictIt and Polymarket tell a different story",
    "content": "But prediction markets tell a different story. PredictIt shows Trump's campaign in the lead as the 2024 presidential election winner. It also has the GOP winning the presidency and the electoral college margin. As of Monday afternoon, Polymarket, a cryptocurrency-based prediction marketplace, also shows Trump has a better chance of winning the election on Nov. 5.While prediction markets have been around for a while, they've grown in popularity -- especially for political events. These betting sites allow traders to buy and sell shares on the outcome of a given event, like whether Trump will get impeached or Biden will leave the presidential race.Traders then buy shares depending on which outcome they think is more likely. Share prices or \"odds\" rise and fall depending on demand. If the event happens the way the trader predicted, the contract or \"bet\" will rise to $1 and pay out -- or fall to $0 if it does not.Prediction markets can be a more sophisticated and accurate way to foresee political events, Thomas Miller, a data scientist at Northwestern University, told Fortune's Shawn Tully. Miller is renowned for his accurate predictions during the 2020 election, and much of his methodology comes from examining prediction markets.\"Political betting sites are the best at predicting the wisdom of the crowd,\" he told Fortune.While polls tell you about how people responded in the recent past, the odds on sites like PredictIt and Polymarket show real-time sentiment and are better for mapping the future, according to Miller. Plus, polls don't show who will win the electoral college, while traders on prediction markets can wager on its outcome.Three national polls released Sunday show Harris's lead is slimming.Last month, an ABC/Ipsos poll of likely voters showed Harris with a six-point lead over Trump. But that gap has closed to 50% support for Harris to 48% for Trump. A CBS/YouGov poll shows Harris up 51% to 48%, down from a four-point lead last month. And NBC's poll of registered voters shows a complete tie between Harris and Trump, both at 48%.\"As summer has turned to fall, any signs of momentum for Kamala Harris have stopped,\" Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff, told NBC. \"The race is a dead heat.\"Meanwhile, Polymarket shows Trump has a 54% chance of winning the presidential election with Harris trailing behind at just a 45.3% chance.PredictIt's markets are a little closer. For the market called \"Who will win the 2024 US presidential election?\" the \"yes\" outcome for Trump is currently at $0.54 and the \"yes\" outcome for Harris is $0.50.\"If you wanted a single best predictor, one source of information to know what's going on in the elections, it's the prediction market,\" Harry Crane, a statistics professor at Rutgers University, told CNN. \"Any given piece of information that you might have, such as a poll or an aggregator, or news, or a pundit's opinion, all of that is being combined in the participant's markets who have an incentive to get it right and to make money off of it.\"But if prediction markets are as accurate as some experts say, why would there be such a discrepancy with what polls are showing? It comes down to what each is measuring, Ryan Waite, vice president of public affairs at public affairs consultancy Think Big, told Fortune.\"Polls tell us how voters feel right now, while prediction markets attempt to predict what will happen in the future,\" he said. \"Prediction markets are quicker to respond to new information, such as economic shifts or debate performances, while polls take time to update.\"But prediction markets aren't perfect, Waite said, explaining that they can be manipulated by someone with a lot of money who wants to sway perception and that they aren't always accessible to everyone.Still, polls have issues of their own, including sampling bias, leading questioning, and non-responses that can also produce inaccuracies. That's why -- at least for now -- using both polls and prediction markets can help us understand future political events.\"While prediction markets are gaining traction, they're not going to replace traditional polling anytime soon,\" Waite said. \"They provide a complementary perspective. Polls help us understand how different voter segments feel about candidates or issues, while prediction markets can provide a dynamic view of how the broader public thinks things will play out. Together, they give a fuller picture of the political landscape.\"",

    "title": "Presidents of the United States: Millard Fillmore, leader of the Compromise",
    "content": "Editor's Note: This profile is part of a series taking a closer look at US presidents ahead of the 2024 presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.Millard Fillmore, the 13th president of the United States, is often remembered as a transitional figure in the turbulent years leading up to the American Civil War.His presidency is most notable for the Compromise of 1850, which sought to ease tensions between free and slave states. Though Fillmore's efforts temporarily averted conflict, his administration's policies on slavery and sectionalism left a complicated legacy.Fillmore's rise in politicsMillard Fillmore was born on January 7, 1800, in a log cabin in Moravia, New York, to Nathaniel and Phoebe Fillmore. The second of nine children, Fillmore grew up in a poor farming family and had little formal education.However, he was determined to rise above his humble beginnings, and through self-study, he became a teacher and later an apprentice to a lawyer. By 1823, Fillmore was admitted to the New York State Bar, and he began practising law in East Aurora, New York.Fillmore entered politics in the late 1820s as a member of the Anti-Masonic Party, an early third party in American politics. In 1832, he was elected to the New York State Assembly, where he gained a reputation as a moderate and pragmatic legislator.By the mid-1830s, Fillmore had aligned himself with the Whig Party, which opposed the policies of US President Andrew Jackson.Fillmore in the spotlightFillmore was elected to the US House of Representatives in 1833, where he served for eight years. During his time in Congress, he became an advocate for economic modernisation, supporting tariffs to protect American industry and federal funding for infrastructure projects such as roads and canals.He also played a significant role in the creation of the US Treasury Department, co-authoring legislation that established the department in 1841.After leaving Congress, Fillmore served as New York's comptroller, where he worked to reform the state's financial system. His success in this role boosted his standing within the Whig Party, and in 1848, he was chosen as the vice-presidential candidate on a ticket with General Zachary Taylor.The Compromise of 1850 and sectional tensionsFillmore became president on July 9, 1850, following the death of US President Zachary Taylor, who had served just 16 months in office. As president, Fillmore inherited the nation's growing divide over the issue of slavery, particularly in the newly acquired territories from the Mexican-American War.One of Fillmore's most consequential acts as president was his support for the Compromise of 1850, a package of five laws aimed at resolving the status of slavery in the territories.The compromise included the admission of California as a free state, the establishment of territorial governments in New Mexico and Utah without restrictions on slavery, and the abolition of the slave trade in Washington DC.It also included the controversial Fugitive Slave Act, which required that escaped enslaved people be returned to their owners, even if they had reached free states.While the Compromise of 1850 temporarily calmed sectional tensions, the Fugitive Slave Act sparked widespread outrage in the North, where abolitionists viewed it as a betrayal of their values.Fillmore's enforcement of the law alienated many Northern Whigs, contributing to the eventual collapse of the party.Fillmore opens relations with JapanFillmore's presidency also saw several notable foreign policy initiatives. He opened relations with Japan, dispatching Commodore Matthew Perry on a mission to establish trade with the isolationist nation.Perry's mission ultimately resulted in the Treaty of Kanagawa in 1854, which marked the beginning of formal relations between the US and Japan.Domestically, Fillmore supported internal improvements, including expanding the nation's railroad system and improving harbours and waterways. He also presided over the admission of California as a state and the expansion of territories in the American West.Post-presidency FillmoreFillmore's decision to support the Compromise of 1850, particularly the Fugitive Slave Act, made him unpopular with many in the North, and he failed to secure the Whig Party's nomination for the 1852 election. After leaving the presidency in 1853, Fillmore retired to Buffalo, New York.In 1856, Fillmore returned to the national stage as the presidential candidate for the American Party, also known as the \"Know-Nothing\" Party, which was focused on nativist and anti-immigrant policies.He finished third in the election, behind Democrat James Buchanan and Republican John C Frémont.Fillmore largely retired from public life after his defeat in 1856. He continued to serve his community in Buffalo, engaging in charitable and educational activities, and was involved in the founding of the University at Buffalo.Millard Fillmore's legacyMillard Fillmore's presidency is often viewed as one of compromise and moderation during a period of increasing sectional tension.His support for the Compromise of 1850, particularly the Fugitive Slave Act, has been criticised for enabling the expansion of slavery and deepening the divide between North and South.While his foreign policy initiatives, such as opening relations with Japan, are seen as successful, Fillmore is generally regarded as a president who struggled to navigate the complex and divisive issues of his time.He remains a somewhat overlooked figure in American history, often overshadowed by the more prominent leaders who followed him in the lead-up to the Civil War.",

As thousands of counties and towns report vote totals, it can be hard to figure out when the results reported so far will reflect the outcome. Past elections can provide a guide.Want to follow election results like a pro? Here's what to watch in key statesThe Constitution sets out broad principles for electing a national government and leaves the details to the states. The choices made by state lawmakers and election officials as they sort out those details affect everything from how voters cast a ballot, how quickly the tabulation and release of results takes place, how elections are kept secure and how officials maintain voters' confidence in the process.Florida has nearly all ballots counted on Election Day, while California can take weeks. This is whyIt may be no surprise that people seek certainty before elections happen, given what they see as the stakes: One recent poll found that about 7 in 10 Americans believe that the future of democracy is at stake in this year's presidential election. Yet often the forecasters themselves are the first to push back on the characterization that they can tell you what's going to happen.How elections forecasters became political 'prophets'If you want to cast a ballot on Election Day or vote by mail, it helps to know the rules.Who can vote in US elections, and what steps must you take to do so?Voting before Election Day is much more common today than it was roughly 50 years ago. Yet it is highly politicized as voting in the 2024 presidential election is already underway.How voting before Election Day became so widespread and so politicalIn a closely contested presidential election, as many expect 2024 to be, the results in a few bellwether counties in the key battleground states are likely to decide the outcome, just as they did in the past two general elections. Here's a look at those that might matter the most on Election Day:Where are the voters who could decide the presidential election?The U.S. general election on Nov. 5 will decide the country's direction, but it is far from a nationally administered contest. The 50 states and the District of Columbia run their own elections, and each does things a little differently.Not all elections look the same. Here are some of the different ways states run their votingAn uncommon system of voting could be central to which party controls the U.S. House this fall -- or even the presidency. In Maine and Alaska, voters in competitive congressional districts will elect a winner using ranked choice voting. Here's how it works:Ranked choice voting could decide which party controls the US House. How does it work?Voter fraud does happen occasionally. When it does, we tend to hear a lot about it. It also gets caught and prosecuted. The nation's multilayered election processes provide many safeguards that keep voter fraud generally detectable and rare, according to current and former election administrators of both parties.Yes, voter fraud happens. But it's rare and election offices have safeguards to catch itElection officials rely on various pieces of technology. Every office does things a little bit differently. In November's presidential election, nearly every ballot cast will have a paper record that can be used to obtain an accurate count even if there are errors or cyberattacks.Voting systems have been under attack since 2020, but are tested regularly for accuracy and securityControversies over hand counting have flared periodically in pockets of the country before the 2024 presidential election, even though research has shown that it is more prone to error, costlier and likely to delay results.Election conspiracy theories fueled a push to hand-count votes, but doing so is risky and slowFeeds and live videos streaming from election sites across the country are an effort by election officials to demystify voting and provide greater transparency to a process that in recent years has been subject to intense scrutiny, misinformation and false claims of widespread fraud.On a screen near you: Officials are livestreaming the election process for more transparencyAmerica's court system has no formal role in the election process, and judges generally try not to get involved because they don't want to be seen as interfering or shaping a partisan outcome, said Paul Schiff Berman, a professor at George Washington University Law School. But election disputes have increasingly landed in court since Bush v. Gore, Berman said.Courts could see wave of election lawsuits, but experts say bar to change outcome is highThe presidential race is competitive. That's about as much as the national polls can tell us right now, even if it looks like Democrat Kamala Harris is down in one poll or Republican Donald Trump is up in another.Will the polls be right in 2024? What polling on the presidential race can and can't tell youChances are, you have never been contacted for an election poll. But the dozens of high-quality election polls that will be released before Election Day represent a reasonable estimate of the opinions of all Americans.How a poll can represent your opinion even if you weren't contacted for itThe Electoral College is the unique American system of electing presidents. It is different from the popular vote, and it has an outsize impact on how candidates run and win campaigns.What is the Electoral College and how does the US use it to elect presidents?It's election night, the polls have closed and chances are you're waiting on one of the major television networks to say who will be the next president. But why does the news media play that role in the first place? Shouldn't that be the government's job? Here's a brief history:News media don't run elections. Why do they call the winners?For the outcome of this year's presidential race, it will be the vote count on election night and possibly in the days after that will grab the public's attention. But those numbers are unofficial until the election is formally certified -- a once uneventful process that has become politicized since then-President Trump tried to overturn his reelection loss four years ago.Election certification is a traditionally routine duty that has become politicized in the Trump eraWith the American electorate so evenly divided, there will be elections in November close enough that officials will have to recount the votes. Just don't expect those recounts to change the winner. They rarely do, even when the margins are tiny.",

    "content": "With only 22 days remaining until the 2024 Presidential Election, The View co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin urged the Harris campaign to \"ratchet up the fear factor.\"\"I think they need to better utilize surrogates,\" Griffin said during Monday's episode. \"For example, if we consider the young white male voters Trump is targeting, they should have Josh Shapiro appear on Joe Rogan, or have billionaire Jamie Pritzker engage with the Barstool Sports crowd to discuss why their vision is more aspirational. They need to leave nothing on the table in this final stretch.\"A new national poll released Sunday by NBC News showed Trump in a \"dead heat\" with Harris, with the two candidates tied, each with 48 percent support among registered voters. Notably, that's a 4-point boost for Trump compared to NBC News' September poll, and a 1-point decline for Harris.Sunny Hostin disagrees, asserting Harris has run a 'flawless' campaign, having raised a billion dollars. She believes the press shares some of the blame, pointing out CNN reports Democrats are feeling anxious, Axios highlights the \"blue wall blues,\" and FOX claims they are \"scared to death.\"\"Dems are not scared to death, Dems are pumped,\" Hostin said. \"What I would like the press to talk a little bit more about is Trump is in hiding. He didn't do the 60 Minutes interview. He does not want to do another debate. He's in mental decline.\"Co-host Sarah Haines said Harris doesn't have a flawless campaign, as many people still struggle to distinguish her from the Biden administration. She also acknowledged missing several opportunities during her media blitz to set herself apart.\"They know why she's not Donald Trump, but they don't know why she's not President Biden,\" Haines said. \"And I think she needs to be both of those things in an election of change.\"Haines said during her press tour she didn't have to throw Biden under the bus; she could have said, \"I was his wingman. I loved it. We were successful. We did a lot of great things. But now that I'm the boss, these are the things I would love.\"Hostin said Harris indicated she would have a Republican in her cabinet if she had the chance to do things differently. However, when originally asked, \"If anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?\" Kamala responded, \"Not a thing comes to mind.\"Griffin said Republicans are ahead of Democrats in registering new voters in crucial battleground states, which could be pivotal. She also highlighted the importance of change, stating the public is shifting against Biden's policies, regardless of personal opinions about him.Hostin fired back stating, statistically, the Biden administration has been one of the most effective in recent history.The group also discussed Trump's refusal to release his medical information, calling out Republicans as hypocrites for demanding the same from Biden just a few months ago.Hostin said all we're receiving is a comprehensive report from seven years ago.\"He had high cholesterol. That concerns me,\" Hostin said. \"He was overweight, obviously, and he had rosacea. I don't know if I care about that as much, but that's the most information that we have about the man that wants to be next to the nuclear codes.\"She also said Trump's erratic speaking style suggests dementia or cognitive decline, as he often rambles and jumps from topic to topic. However, he refers to this style as \"weaving.\"Ana Navarro chimed in with a joke, suggesting Trump's bronzer color is also a sign of dementia, saying, \"If he gets any darker, he's gonna have to deport himself.\"",

    "title": "LETTERS TO THE EDITOR: Too difficult to call outcome of crucial US election | The Southern Star",
    "content": "EDITOR - The 2024 US presidential election is the most crucial in years. We learned in 2016 that polls are not a guaranteed indicator when Donald Trump was a shock winner. He didn't expect to win and had no proper transition team ready.Past US presidential election wins were more predictable, but some of them had seriously underhand dealings. Watergate is one of two examples when a few of the Republican and Democrat party members succumbed to unethical behaviour.The first example is the Watergate break-in into the Democrat Party's office in the Watergate apartment complex in Washington DC to steal their election plans for the US election in 1972.The burglars were caught on the spot by security guards and it led to Republican US president Richard Nixon having to resign two years later, because of his attempted cover-up of the break-in. The 50th anniversary of his resignation was this year.The break-in was unnecessary as Nixon won his second term in 1972 by a landslide and already had huge support from the American voters. His insecurity as to whether he would win was a factor in the break-in. He previously lost the 1960 US election to JFK by a narrow margin.The men who were caught trying to break in to the Watergate complex were found guilty. President Nixon resigned or he would have been impeached and forced to resign. His successor, vice-president Gerald Ford was not involved in any way in the break-in. He pardoned him to bring it to a dignified end.The second example is when a decade before, the Democrats broke into the Republican Party election offices before the 1964 US presidential election. Their operatives stole election plans of the Republican candidate, Barry Goldwater.The difference between the two break-ins is their burglars were not caught.Another unnecessary break-in. Barry Goldwater did not have national support. President Lyndon Johnson was sure to win. He did by a landslide with sympathy from voters for the Democrat Party after the assassination and loss to the country of his predecessor JFK, the previous year.Johnson had similar insecurities to Nixon about popularity. This time, few can predict the outcome of the US presidential election on November 5th.EDITOR - The situation here in Lebanon is extremely concerning and getting worse each day. Frightening and sleepless nights due to frequent bombing is the new normal for everyone, including us humanitarian workers.It is truly terrifying to live in a city where anywhere can be attacked at any time. The country is witnessing its largest displacement crisis in history due to the ongoing conflict with over 1.2m people seeking refuge from the conflict.The impact of the ongoing hostilities on displaced populations has been immense. Many have lost their homes and loved ones. They are exhausted. People hitchhike for days to try to reach safer locations elsewhere in the country.Hundreds of thousands of people are now camping and sleeping outside in the streets or in parks and on beaches. People are in urgent need of shelters and also basic items like blankets, mattresses, pillows and soap.More and more people are arriving each day after fleeing their homes. Many people are sleeping on floors with no mattresses. Vulnerable groups such as pregnant women and newborn children require specialised support.Concern are on the ground receiving and supporting as many families as we can, but there are huge gaps in the availability of critical services to respond to the ever-increasing overcrowding. The lack of resources will only get worse too as the conflict is further exacerbated.I would like to call upon the Irish community who are known for their compassion and generosity to come forward in this hour of extreme hardship and support our appeal to help the families, children, elderly and everyone displaced in this crisis.EDITOR - There has been no action on the road - no action whatsoever on the problem with the school buses so the children can get to school.What does it take for the government to be involved in what they are supposed to? They are perfectly able to build an exorbitantly-priced bicycle stand and they can ignore the disaster of a children's hospital price. I'm afraid to ask, what have I missed?Since I have lived here there have been constant repairs, in spots, on the N71.Skibbereen was tantalised with a scheme to improve the centre of town. That was a year ago. Perhaps the new footpath on Bridge Street is part of that. But oh please, we need paint! Actually, I would applaud anything that would involve something for our teenagers. A cinema, a bowling area, a swimming pool. What will happen when all the kids move away? Then where is the town going? Wrong word, as it is definitely not going anywhere. Here we are, an Olympic gold medal town ... can we not stand up and be counted?Wouldn't it be something if people said 'wow' when they visited?What a show of appreciation if we saw people taking pictures because they want to remember our town. For those of us who live here, it's the people that make the town, but if we want revenue and support for businesses, we need the visitors.And we need the visitors to talk about us because they are impressed with what they have seen.EDITOR - I was gobsmacked - to put it mildly - to hear last week that the Cork Business Association is going to pay shop owners to keep their lights on - for security reasons - in Cork city. I had to read it twice to be sure it wasn't a mistake - and then check the date that it wasn't April 1st.Are we really saying, at at time when every emphasis around us is on keeping energy consumption down, that money will be used to fund this hair-brained scheme?If so, this money is being used to shore up the gaps left by a shortage of gardaí. If we had more gardaí patrolling the streets we wouldn't need a 'Leave a Light On' initiative.We'll be a laughing stock with this kind of backwards attitude to energy - as the decent people of Ireland strive, every day, to save the planet.",

    "title": "How democratic is the US really?",
    "content": "When Americans elect their next president in November, the candidate with the most votes might not be the winner. Democracy in the US comes with some quirks -- and was under attack not so long ago. How is it faring today?For a long time, the US viewed itself as an exemplary democracy: a country other nations could look to when building their own democracies after gaining independence or shedding authoritarian regimes.That idea is manifested in the \"city upon a hill\" metaphor. Politicians from John F. Kennedy to Barack Obama have referred to the United States as a glowing beacon, drawing everyone's eyes. In 1961, President-elect Kennedy said the world was still looking to the US and its democracy and that \"our governments, in every branch, at every level, national, state and local, must be as a city upon a hill.\"On January 6, 2021, the world's eyes were on the United States. That day, a mob of right-wing extremists, encouraged by then President Donald Trump, stormed the US Capitol in an attempt to interrupt the democratic transfer of power after the 2020 election.And, in a 2023 poll by the Associated Press news agency in cooperation with the University of Chicago, only 10% of participants said that democracy in the United States was working extremely or very well.So what is the state of US democracy today, ahead of the 2024 presidential election?\"I think it's fair to say Americans don't have a lot of trust right now in governmental institutions,\" Michael Berkman, director of the McCourtney Institute for Democracy and a political science professor at Pennsylvania State University told DW. \"They're looking at a Congress that is not functioning well at all and they're looking at some rather intractable problems that government has not really addressed, like gun violence and climate change.\"With their inability to choose a leader, the Republican majority in the House of Representatives paralyzed Congress for weeks in October 2023. But even without interruptions like this, getting any laws through both chambers of Congress -- the House and the Senate -- is slow going because of the deeply entrenched partisanship between Republicans and Democrats.\"It is extremely difficult, sometimes impossible, to pass legislation even when overwhelming majorities of the public support a measure,\" Vanessa Williamson, a senior fellow in governance studies at US think tank the Brookings Institution, told DW. \"There is very serious dysfunction in Washington.\"The harsh polarization, the gulf between Democratic and Republican supporters, means that at least half the country is likely to be extremely unhappy with many decisions the elected government is making.After the 2020 elections, many Republicans (lead by Trump) were so unhappy with the election results that they tried to ignore them, falsely claiming the election was \"stolen\" from them so vehemently that eventually, a mob of those who believed it stormed the Capitol. A peaceful transition of power is one of the hallmarks of democracy, and that almost didn't happen in the US.\"I think what happened on January 6 and the refusal of one side to accept the results of the election is very damaging for a democracy, since accepting the outcome of an election is pretty much central to democratic politics,\" Berkman said.It is not surprising then that trust in democratic institutions has gone down in recent years. But there's more you might not expect from a country like the US.\"In addition to the recent forms of democratic erosion, the United States has many anti-democratic practices of very long standing,\" Williamson said.Chief among them: The winner of the presidential election is not necessarily the one with the most votes.Most recently, Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election even though his opponent, Hillary Clinton, garnered roughly 2.9 million more votes than him. The reason behind this conundrum is the electoral college. In the US, each of the 50 states has a certain number of electors depending on its population size. The candidate who wins the majority of the people's votes in a state is the one who gets the state's electoral votes. Sounds complicated? Here's an example.California as the most populous state has the most electors in the electoral college: 54. The candidate who can get the most Californians to vote for them will receive all 54 of these elector votes, even if they only won the popular vote in California by a narrow margin. Smaller states like Vermont or South Dakota only have three electoral college votes, but the system is the same.To win the presidency, a candidate must win in enough states to bring his electoral college vote up to 270 electors or more. Someone who wins states by small margins can thus become president, even though more Americans in total voted for the other candidate.Another part of the US political system that does not reflect a perfect democracy is the upper chamber of Congress: The US Senate. Each US state has two senators in the chamber -- no matter the state's population size.That means in some states, one senator represents a few hundred thousand people, while in another, a couple of million people \"share\" a senator. When the Senate has a decision to make, each senator's vote holds exactly the same weight, even though they represent vastly different numbers of people.Berkman calls the Senate \"a deeply undemocratic institution.\" And Williamson says that as a result of the way the Senate is set up, \"our most populous regions are profoundly underrepresented in the legislative process.\"The US might not be a model democracy, but Americans haven't given up on it. More people are getting involved.The voter turnout in the 2020 presidential election stood at more than 65%, higher than it had been in more than 100 years.\"You see increased political participation over the last eight, 10 years,\" Berkman said. \"And I think that's important.\"",

The film opened over the weekend courtesy of Briarcliff Entertainment, and Trump is making it very clear that he has no nice feelings about the movie.Trump took to his Truth Social page and went in hard against The Apprentice, calling it \"A FAKE and CLASSLESS\" movie and suggesting the film was being released before the 2024 Presidential Election to \"hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country.\" Much of Trump's online tirade is typical of him and should be no surprise, especially since the project doesn't show him in the best possible light. Given it was the movie's opening weekend, the film is more relevant than ever, and Trump doesn't miss a chance to also be present in any news story where his name is mentioned.It didn't take long for Abbasi to find out about Trump's post and the director soon took to his X page to release his own statement that thanked the presidential hopeful for getting back the film's movie team, saying that he's available to \"talk further if you want.\" However, in a bit of a cheeky response, Abbassi admitted to being busy with press for the film and said, \"But I might be able to give you a call tomorrow.\" So far, Trump hasn't responded to the director's recent post.The Apprentice Debuted to Lackluster Numbers Over the Weekend CloseThe Apprentice opened on 1,740 screens over the weekend, a respectable number for a film that once found it hard to find a distributor, but the movie was met with soft box office numbers, opening to just $1.58 million. Some people have made comments that the current presidential race has turned into quite a spectacle, so any film made about Trump, even if it doesn't touch on his current presidential aspirations, won't be as shocking or salacious as anything going on in his real life. Reviews for the film are good at 78% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, with an even more impressive 85% Popcornmeter that now measures audience reaction on the site. For those who have seen it, the response has appeared to be mostly positive, but being able to reach an audience that is on the fence about the film has been difficult so far.Related The Apprentice Distributor Slams Networks as Cowards After Controversial DecisionABC and CBS have made a decision regarding the upcoming Donald Trump biopic and the presidential debates.1After The Apprentice had its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, the Trump campaign threatened a lawsuit against the film in a statement released by the campaign's chief spokesperson, Steven Cheung. The statement read:\"We will be filing a lawsuit to address the blatantly false assertions from these pretend filmmakers. This garbage is pure fiction which sensationalizes lies that have been long debunked. As with the illegal Biden Trials, this is election interference by Hollywood elites, who know that President Trump will retake the White House and beat their candidate of choice because nothing they have done has worked.\"Written by Gabriel Sherman, The Apprentice tracks Trump's rise as a real estate businessman in New York in the 70s and 80s. The movie particularly focuses on his relationship with lawyer Roy Cohn and how Trump was guided under his mentorship. Of concern from the Trump campaign are likely certain scenes in the film that depict him in a negative light, including violently raping his first wife Ivana (Maria Bakalova) and undergoing cosmetic surgery. After the film's premiere at Cannes, the director addressed the statement that threatened legal action, and he made an offer to meet Trump in person to screen the film with him.\"I don't necessarily think that this is a movie he would dislike. I don't necessarily think he would like it. I think he would be surprised, you know? And like I've said before, I would offer to go and meet him wherever he wants and talk about the context of the movie, have a screening and have a chat afterwards, if that's interesting to anyone at the Trump campaign.\"The Apprentice is now playing in theaters nationwide.4/5 The ApprenticeSet during the early years of Trump's business career, the film focuses on the relationship of Trump and Roy Cohn, a New York City prosecutor known for working with Senator Joseph McCarthy during the Second Red Scare.",

Trump has demanded that Vice President Kamala Harris undergo a test for cognitive stamina and agility, igniting a fierce debate over her mental acuity and the integrity of the media.Taking to social media, Trump expressed his concerns, asserting, \"Her actions have led many to believe that there could be something very wrong with her.\"The provocative statement comes on the heels of a contentious media appearance by Harris, during which Trump alleged that CBS and 60 minutes attempted to shield her by \"illegally and unscrupulously\" replacing a controversial answer with a response unrelated to the original question.Trump's tirade, laden with his trademark hyperbole, accused Harris of being \"slow and lethargic\" in her responses, claiming that even the simplest inquiries leave her fumbling for answers.\"We just went through almost four years of that; we shouldn't have to do it again!\" he exclaimed, evoking memories of his own tumultuous presidency.The former president's comments have set off a political firestorm, with supporters rallying around his call for transparency, while opponents vehemently defend Harris's competence and ability to serve in her role.Critics have dismissed Trump's remarks as an unfounded attack aimed at undermining Harris's position and credibility, asserting that such demands are unbecoming of a former president.Political analysts speculate that Trump's incendiary remarks may be part of a broader strategy to galvanise his base ahead of the 2024 presidential election, while also serving to divert attention from his own legal challenges.As the political landscape grows increasingly polarized, the fallout from Trump's statement is sure to resonate in the weeks to come, prompting discussions around cognitive testing, media accountability, and the implications of political rhetoric in the current climate.The White House has yet to respond officially to Trump's accusations, but Harris's supporters remain steadfast, insisting that her capability as vice president is beyond question.The debate has intensified, with both sides preparing for an escalating war of words as the nation approaches a pivotal election year.In a climate charged with tension and division, Trump's latest remarks underscore the deepening rift within American politics, leaving many to wonder how far this battle for the narrative will go.",

    "title": "JD Vance and the GOP's Long Game",
    "content": "The 2024 presidential election has shaped up to be more than just another cycle of political showmanship - it's a carefully orchestrated strategy by the far-right to reshape the American political landscape for generations to come. At the center of this chess game is JD Vance, the Ohio senator who emerged from the shadows of political obscurity to become a rising star in conservative circles. His potential role as Donald Trump's running mate, coupled with his involvement in Project 2025, is a crucial piece of a long game designed to upend American democracy as we know it.Before JD Vance became a potential running mate for Donald Trump, he was one of Trump's most vocal critics. During the 2016 election, Vance openly condemned Trump, describing him as \"noxious\" and warning that his divisive rhetoric was dangerous for the country. As the Yale-educated author of Hillbilly Elegy, Vance positioned himself as an opponent of Trump's populism, believing his presidency would have disastrous consequences. On the eighth anniversary of a 2016 tweet where he reflected on his disapproval of Trump, he wrote, \"Trump makes people I care about - immigrants, Muslims, etc. - afraid. Because of this, I found him objectionable. God wants better for us.\"However, as Trump's influence within the Republican Party grew stronger, Vance underwent a significant political shift. He gradually aligned himself with Trumpism, embracing the policies he once criticized. This transformation was not just opportunistic but part of Vance's more enormous ambition to rise within the GOP, ultimately positioning him as a potential running mate for Trump.The Long Game: JD Vance as Trump's Running MateJD Vance's ascendancy in the Republican Party seems to have been deliberately engineered. Once a critic of Trump, Vance transformed himself into a fervent supporter of the former president's policies and persona. His alignment with Trumpism was not merely opportunistic but strategic, positioning himself as a bridge between Trump's base and the far-right intellectual movement.The notion of Vance as Trump's running mate plays into a larger conservative plan that doesn't necessarily rely on Trump serving a full term. If Trump wins in 2024, his presidency could be brief, with his apparent cognitive decline and poor health, the 25th Amendment looming as a potential exit strategy. The 25th Amendment allows for the removal of a president who is \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office,\" a tool that could be used by Republicans, especially if Trump's legal troubles, health, or mental fitness become problematic.This is where Vance comes in. Vance represents a younger, ideologically extreme version of Trump, with a far deeper commitment to dismantling the structures of American democracy than Trump himself. The plan? Remove Trump under the guise of the 25th Amendment and elevate Vance, who would have the full backing of the conservative movement's infrastructure. This would be a bait-and-switch of epic proportions, placing an even more dangerous figure in the Oval Office.Project 2025: The Blueprint for the Far-Right TakeoverAt the heart of this conservative takeover is Project 2025, a plan spearheaded by groups like the Heritage Foundation and other influential far-right think tanks. Project 2025 outlines a roadmap for radically reshaping the federal government, including dismantling regulatory agencies, gutting civil service protections, and reshaping the judiciary to entrench conservative power further.Vance's involvement in Project 2025 underscores his deeply embedded in this agenda. Project 2025 doesn't just aim to reverse Biden-era policies; it seeks to return to a pre-1960s America, undoing civil rights legislation, environmental protections, and women's rights. This project envisions a country where executive power is vastly expanded, oversight is reduced, and dissent is quashed. Vance, who has openly criticized government bureaucracy and supports extreme conservative policies, is the perfect candidate to carry out such a vision.If Trump were elected and later removed, Vance could seamlessly continue the Project 2025 agenda with little opposition. His polished, intellectual demeanor makes him more palatable to mainstream conservatives than Trump ever was, but his policies would be far more devastating. Unlike Trump, who often governs based on impulse, Vance would govern with precision, systematically dismantling the very foundations of American democracy.The 25th Amendment as a Political ToolThe 25th Amendment was never meant to be used as a political weapon, but the far-right could quickly weaponize it to achieve its goals. Trump, despite his immense popularity among the Republican base, is an unpredictable figure. His bombastic style and erratic behavior make him vulnerable to removal, mainly if his legal challenges catch up with him. The right could invoke the 25th Amendment under the guise of Trump's inability to perform his duties while planning to replace him with a figure more aligned with their long-term goals.This is where Vance's appeal becomes even more critical. He offers the conservative right a way to achieve their ideological goals without the chaos that surrounds Trump. Vance, a calculated and disciplined politician, can execute Project 2025 without the distraction of scandal or incompetence. By removing Trump, the far-right could place a more practical but equally extreme leader in power, cloaking their authoritarian agenda in legitimacy.The Threat to American DemocracyJD Vance's potential rise to the presidency is not just a concern for liberals or moderates; it's a fundamental threat to the democracy that has defined the United States for centuries. Vance's alignment with Project 2025 shows that he is not interested in preserving the institutions of the American government but in remaking them to reflect a far-right, authoritarian vision. His policies would devastate the checks and balances system, erode civil liberties, and strip away the progress made on issues like racial justice, gender equality, and environmental protection.If Trump is elected and then removed under the 25th Amendment, a Vance presidency would be poised to accelerate the most radical aspects of Project 2025. Regulatory agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency could be gutted, effectively ending federal oversight on climate change and environmental justice issues. Civil rights protections, particularly for marginalized communities, could be rolled back under the guise of \"states' rights\" and \"individual freedom.\" The judiciary could be stacked with far-right judges, further entrenching conservative power for decades to come.Conclusion: A Bait-and-Switch of Epic Proportions HypotheticalThe 2024 election may seem like a repeat of past political cycles, but there's much more at stake. JD Vance as Donald Trump's running mate is not a coincidence; it's a strategic move by the conservative right to ensure that their radical agenda is carried out, even if Trump is removed from office. By using the 25th Amendment to elevate Vance, the far-right would not only continue their war on American democracy but would accelerate it in ways that even Trump has been unable to.The threat posed by this plan cannot be overstated. Under Vance's leadership, Project 2025 would systematically dismantle the pillars of American democracy, pushing the country toward an authoritarian regime disguised as populism. This is not just about electing a president; it's about changing the very fabric of the United States.If voters aren't paying attention, they could be in for the bait-and-switch of a lifetime - one that could devastate the democracy we know and cherish.",

Trump is played by the Marvel actor Sebastian Stan and Cohn by the Succession star Jeremy Strong.Trump's ex-wife Ivana Trump is played by Maria Bakalova - whose breakout role in Borat Subsequent Moviefilm landed her an Academy award nomination.

Trump said he hoped it would \"bomb\" and alleged that the was \"put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country, 'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!'\"The Apprentice has spurred praise and controversy since its premiere at the Cannes film festival in May. The screenwriter, Gabriel Sherman, described numerous roadblocks in its production.Actors were reluctant to \"humanize\" Trump, Sherman said in Vanity Fair, and Hollywood institutions did not want to fund the project. And, the most significant investor into this project allegedly threatened to kill the film after viewing it.This investor was Dan Snyder, a billionaire who formerly owned the NFL's Washington Commanders and a major Trump supporter. Snyder reportedly invested in The Apprentice through his son-in-law Mark Rapaport's film production company, Variety said.\"He was under the impression that it was a flattering portrayal of the 45th president,\" the outlet reported.The Apprentice is anything but. It contains a scene in which Trump's character appears to sexually assault his first wife, Ivana, takes amphetamines, undergoes liposuction, and receives a hair transplant.Ivana claimed that Trump raped her during a divorce deposition, but later recanted this allegation. Trump has denied attacking Ivana. Trump, who has been found liable of sexually abusing the writer E Jean Carroll in civil court, has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 20 women.Trump's lawyers sent The Apprentice's film-makers cease-and-desist letters, and prominent distributors would not go near it. \"Hollywood fashions itself as a community of truth tellers,\" Sherman said, \"but here they were running from a movie to prepare for a Trump presidency.\"In his social media attack posted just before 1am, Trump focused on the film's depiction of Ivana, who died in July 2022 after an accidental fall.\"My former wife, Ivana, was a kind and wonderful person, and I had a great relationship with her until the day she died,\" Trump wrote. \"The writer of this pile of garbage, Gabe Sherman, a lowlife and talentless hack, who has long been widely discredited, knew that, but chose to ignore it.\"So sad that HUMAN SCUM, like the people involved in this hopefully unsuccessful enterprise, are allowed to say and do whatever they want in order to hurt a Political Movement, which is far bigger than any of us.

This garbage is pure fiction which sensationalizes lies that have been long debunked,\" Steven Cheung, Trump campaign communications director, said in a statement.Cheung likened the film to purported \"witch-hunts\" by his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, saying it was \"election interference by Hollywood elites right before November, who know that President Trump will retake the White House and beat their candidate of choice because nothing they have done has worked.\"This 'film' is pure malicious defamation, should never see the light of day, and doesn't even deserve a place in the straight-to-DVD section of a bargain bin at a soon-to-be-closed discount movie store, it belongs in a dumpster fire,\" Cheung also said.",

    "title": "Opinion: A dark money group is trying to manipulate voters with ads about Oklahoma judges",
    "content": "Aside from 2024 presidential election race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, here are other key races to eye ahead of Election Day in November.There's been one -- and only one -- Oklahoma governmental body that we've been able to count on to restore sanity and stay out of the day-to-day political brawls and power struggles playing out in the state Capitol.The Oklahoma Supreme Court.So I guess it was only a matter of time before a group of conservatives took a whirl at dragging our highest court into the muck with the other branches of state government.A conservative group cloaked in shadows launched a campaign urging voters to boot three of Supreme Court justices: Noma Gurich, Yvonne Kauger and James Edmondson. The group is hoping to tilt the power on the court using our normally benign retention elections -- a section of the ballot that you've likely not paid much attention to before.Retention ballot measures ask voters a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" question about whether appointed judges should continue to serve after their official appointment period ends (and at the Supreme Court level, they traditionally do).More: Ads target Oklahoma Supreme Court justices over 'padding the pockets of trial lawyers'Oklahoma voters have never not retained a justice. Yes, that was a double negative for emphasis. In other words, Oklahoma voters have always said an appointed judge placed on the ballot should keep serving.In hindsight, I'm surprised it took so long for someone to try to use our election system to manipulate voters into altering the Oklahoma Supreme Court's makeup through retention elections.After all, our justices have been busy for years now striking fear into the hearts of lawmakers and special interests groups by axing loads of patently unconstitutional laws that have the grubby fingerprints of lobbyists and activists all over them.Our justices have struck down: abortion bans, a law that restricted when schools could require masks, a cap on pain and suffering damages, a liquor law that sought to control alcohol sales, tort reform, special fees on electric and hybrid vehicles, a Ten Commandments monument at the state Capitol and the existence of the nation's first publicly funded religious charter school.I'm going to stop there with the caveat that that's just a fraction of what they've done.More: Does my vote matter? Where your vote in Oklahoma can make a differenceJust looking at the list of all the unconstitutional -- and sometimes downright bonkers -- legislation that our Court has rejected makes me a little queasy.So let's pause for a respectful moment of silence as the mournful sounds of taps begin to sound in the distance.After all, what could go wrong if we metaphorically dropped a lit match into a gas-filled room and handed our monied special interests groups the keys to the last independent vestige that remains standing in our kingdom?Kablam!Because if these conservative activists have their way and manage to convince voters to do the unthinkable and fire three justices in one swoop, we'll be obliterating the system of checks and balances that we've come to rely on and heralding a new era where we have a judiciary beholden to those that have the money to keep them in office and power.There's a reason why there are three branches of government. They keep each other in check.I'm not sorry that some people are butthurt over our high court's decisions, but I am fearful that they think Oklahoma voters are dumb enough to begin the process of further politicizing our judiciary.Why?I find it very suspicious that the three justices being targeted by the group People for Opportunity were all appointed by former Democratic governors and are being highlighted as \"liberal.\"And I'm concerned that opponents of the judges are running a smear campaign that reeks of age discrimination. The ads point out that these folks are all over the age of 70. Are they suggesting that once someone turns 70, it's time to put them out to pasture, and they're of no more use to society? (Lest we forget the role age has played in another election this year, former President Donald Trump is 78.)I'm not naive enough to think our Supreme Court is free of political intrigue. These days nothing is. But right now, we're successfully managing to navigate a fine line, and I don't feel like our court resembles the very partisan U.S. Supreme Court.I'd like to keep it that way.In addition, we don't even know who is funding this late-election campaign.The source of the group's funding and broader membership is -- legally -- blocked from the public's view. Dare I call it dark money? We know members of the conservative Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs are involved because they're one of the few that's had the guts to put their names and faces on the effort.But at this point, pretty much everyone else is skulking creepily in the shadows, egging this on from the slimy sewers.If this is so great, put your name and face on it.I fear the shadowy operatives believe they can convince Gov. Kevin Stitt to put puppets on the bench that are more favorable to their causes, which is bad news for the average Oklahoman.It turns out the money and influence special interests wield in the halls of our Capitol doesn't spend as well in our Supreme Court.But the campaign backers are banking on the fact that voters know very little about our Supreme Court justices.And, they'd be right.Judicial ethics prevents judges facing retention votes from campaigning unless there's active opposition to their remaining in the post.It's expensive to wage a statewide election campaign. Candidates often have to accept money from those they'll help regulate, which can later raise thorny ethical questions.Our justices don't campaign, and that's the way it should be.The good news is voters have some time to think about the path they want for the Oklahoma Supreme Court.Unlike our Republican primaries, everyone gets to weigh in on this outcome.",

Today is a tight day  a lot of press for  but I might be able to give you a call tomorrow.\"What is the Donald Trump movie The Apprentice?The Apprentice is a new movie based on the early rise of Trump as a real estate businessman. It depicts his ascension beyond the shadow of his father, Fred Trump, and his relationship with lawyer Roy Cohn.After premiering at the 2024 Cannes International Film Festival, The Apprentice found distribution. Briarcliff Entertainment acquired the rights to distribute the movie, releasing it on October 11, 2024.Sebastian Stan, known for playing Bucky Barnes/the Winter Soldier in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), starred as Trump in the movie. Jeremy Strong and Maria Bakalova portrayed Roy Cohn and Ivana Trump, respectively.Ali Abbasi directed The Apprentice and is best known for directing Shelley and Holy Spider. The writer, Gabriel Sherman, who Trump called a \"lowlife and talentless hack,\" previously wrote a biography about Fox News Channel's president, Roger Ailes.Despite generally positive reviews -- it holds a 78% from critics on Rotten Tomatoes -- The Apprentice has not been a box office hit. During its opening weekend, it grossed under $1.6 million domestically.That was less than other new releases like Terrifier 3 ($18.3 million), Piece by Piece ($3.8 million), and My Hero Academia: You're Next ($3 million).It did make more than two other new releases, Average Joe ($1.1 million) and We Live in Time ($225,911). However, the latter had its limited release last weekend, only playing in five theaters. It averaged $45,182 per theater, easily the highest of the weekend.",

    "content": "GEORGIA, -- As voters prepare to brave the lines for the 2024 Presidential Election, 11Alive wants citizens to be informed of changes in Georgia's 2024 election process. Here are the key details about Georgia's Election Integrity Act 2021, or Law S.B. 202.The law, which faced much scrutiny during its revision, has five central elements: New restrictions on the use of drop boxes and mobile voting, changes in absentee and provisional ballots, and an expansion on where people can serve as poll workers.RELATED: 11Alive 2024 election county-by-county voter guide | Fulton, Gwinnett, DeKalb, Cobb and ClaytonVoters now need to provide their driver's license number or specified voter ID, request their ballot at least 11 days before the election, and use an updated absentee ballot form.The rules for absentee ballots were less stringent before SB 202, with no requirement for a driver's license number or specific voter ID. Additionally, the timeline for requesting absentee ballots was more flexible, giving voters until the Friday before Election Day.Counties are now limited to one drop box per 100,000 registered voters. Drop boxes must be located at the office of the board of registrars, absentee ballot clerk, or inside advance voting locations, adding that they can only be opened while the voting is being conducted.Previously, there was no restriction on the number of drop boxes, their service times, or their location.The law makes it a misdemeanor to give away food or water within 150 feet of the outer edge of a polling place building or within 25 feet of any voter in line. Voters can bring their own food and refreshments with them to stand in line. Poll workers can make available \"self-service water from an unattended receptacle to an elector waiting in line to vote.\"This only applied to campaign materials, petition signatures, and setting up tables within 150 feet of the outer edge of a polling place building or within 25 feet of any voter in line.Provisional ballots cast in the wrong precinct will only count if cast after 5 p.m. Voters who arrive at the wrong precinct before 5 p.m. will be directed to their correct precinct.Voters who went to the wrong precinct on Election Day could cast a provisional ballot and cast a ballot for any race at that precinct if they were eligible.Mobile voting units can only be used during declared disasters under SB 202.Mobile units were introduced and used to expand early voting opportunities.Changes allow poll workers to serve in adjoining counties, expanding the pool of eligible workers.Poll workers were required to be residents or employees of the county they wished to serve.Other changes included in House Bill 1118 to protect poll workers were re-introduced in February following the experience of former Fulton County election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss. The mother-daughter duo endured death threats from across the nation after former President Donald Trump and his attorney Rudy Giuliani accused them of election fraud, a claim that was quickly debunked.If it becomes law, the bill would expand current protections to all election workers, such as contract workers, part-time workers, seasonal workers, and credentialed observers. It would also protect an election worker's personal information from Freedom of Information requests.Rep. Saira Draper, Georgia House Representative for District 90, sponsors the bill. She said she is also adding language to the bill requiring the State Election Board to compile a report about how many threats are reported to the Attorney General's hotline.RELATED: New changes could come to Georgia poll worker protection bill",

    "title": "Presidents of the United States: Franklin Pierce, the man who opened the door to Civil War",
    "content": "Editor's Note: This is part of a series of profiles taking a closer look at US presidents ahead of the 2024 presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.Though Franklin Pierce came to the White House during a time of apparent peace, the undercurrents of conflict between the north and south over slavery were already growing stronger.The US had attempted to deal with the subject through the Missouri Compromise of 1820, but tensions between the two halves of the country remained ready to combust.Pierce, from New England and at the time the youngest man to hold the office, proclaimed an era of peace and prosperity were at hand when he was sworn in.Events were to prove him wrong.Let's take a closer look at the 14th president of the United States.Early yearsPierce was born on November 23, 1804, in New Hampshire's Hillsboro. His parents were Benjamin and Anna Pierce. His father was a governor.Pierce went to Bowdoin College in Maine and studied law in Massachusetts. He was admitted to the bar and then married Jane Means Appleton in 1834.PoliticsPierce entered politics in 1829 as a Democrat. He served in the New Hampshire legislature before becoming Speaker of the House. He was then elected to the House of Representatives and the Senate.Though Pierce was popular in Congress because of his good looks and fine oratory, he accomplished little of note. He then left politics for personal reasons and returned to New Hampshire where he resumed his practice.Pierce next served as an officer in the Mexican-American War and rose to the rank of brigadier, but otherwise kept out of the public eye.Then, in 1852, the Democrats were at a deadlock at their political convention. After 35 rounds of ballots, Pierce's name was proposed as the candidate. Pierce, ever a moderate, was little known. Better still, he was amenable to all parties.By round 48, the nomination was his. His wife Jane, however, was not pleased at all. Jane by all accounts disdained politics. So much so that Pierce had to reassure her that he was not seeking the nomination. Upon learning that her husband had obtained the nomination, Jane fainted.Pierce easily defeated Whig Party nominee Winfield Scott - who incidentally had commanded Pierce during the war.Tragedy struck the Pierces before he even took office. Months before the swearing-in, they lost their only surviving child - eleven-year-old Benny - in a train accident. Worse, both parents witnessed the tragedy. It was a blow from which neither of them, particularly Jane, would fully recover.Pierce was sworn in sans an inaugural ball and the First Lady missing from his side.Time in officeThe issue of slavery hung over the entire nation - and the Pierce administration. Pierce attempted to stack his cabinet with people from both sides of the divide, but that did not help matters.The appointment of Jefferson David - who would go on to become the president of the Confederacy - as Secretary of War drew howls of derision from those who were anti-slavery Pierce as president pushed for and signed the Kansas-Nebraska Act - which repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820 that had sought to keep slavery limited to the southern states.This was one of the most important pieces of legislation, and consequential moments, in US history. The Act would set the stage for the rise of the Republican Party and Abraham Lincoln and set America inexorably on the path towards the Civil War. The resulting battle known as 'Bleeding Kansas' between pro and anti-slavery supporters would be a bloody prologue of what was to come.By now a divisive figure, Pierce became the first sitting president seeking a second term who was denied by the party. The Democrats instead chose James Buchanan, who would win the presidency. Pierce toured Europe, then returned to New Hampshire and quietly retired from public life.Now, slavery was Buchanan's problem - and it would soon be up to Lincoln to solve the issue once and for all. Pierce, who had drunk heavily throughout his life, became an alcoholic and passed away in 1869.LegacyHistorians do not view Pierce kindly. After all, it was under his auspices that the path to near ruin - Civil War - was laid. However, it is undeniable that events and pieces of legislation that would go down in history, occurred under his tenure.Pierce should perhaps be viewed as a cautionary tale of what a leader should not be in times of strife.",

    "content": "The judge in Donald Trump's election-fraud case doesn't care that the allegations may embarrass him in election season, a former prosecutor has said.Judge Tanya Chutkan has ordered the release of yet more explosive evidence in the case, despite objections from Trump's attorneys that it could be damaging at election time.The Republican presidential nominee is accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States; conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding; obstruction and attempting to obstruct an official proceeding; and conspiracy against rights in connection with an alleged pressure campaign on state officials to reverse the 2020 election results.The former president has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him and repeatedly said he is the victim of a political witch hunt. He has accused chief prosecutor Jack Smith of attempting to interfere in the 2024 presidential election by prosecuting him. Newsweek sought email comment from Trump's attorney on Monday.Writing in her legal blog, Civil Discourse, on Sunday, former federal prosecutor and frequent critic of Trump, Joyce Vance, noted that Chutkan has repeatedly told the Republican's lawyers that his embarrassment is irrelevant to the case. \"Judge Chutkan continues to show a total lack of interest in Trump's argument that nothing can become public because of the election,\" Vance wrote.She noted that, in an order on October 10, Chutkan wrote, \"Defendant's concern with the political consequences of these proceedings is not a cognizable legal prejudice\" that would merit sealing the evidence further. Chutkan granted prosecutors' motion that an appendix of evidence in the case should be released. However, she has given Trump until October 17 to decide how to examine any legal options that might prevent the release.Trump's lawyers had requested \"that the Court stay that determination for a reasonable period of time so that  can evaluate litigation options relating to the decision.\"On October 2, Chutkan unsealed a 165-page evidence brief in the case, against the wishes of Trump and his lawyers, who argued that it could damage the Republican nominee during the presidential election cycle.The brief contained new information about Trump's alleged activities during the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol in 2021.The brief detailed his alleged indifference to the fate of Vice President Mike Pence as pro-Trump rioters hunted for him in the Capitol.It added that Trump's team had tried to garner support for a flawed report into alleged voter machine fraud in Michigan. The then-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee refused to publish the report and told Trump it was \"f***ing nuts.\"The latest proposed release concerns a substantial appendix to the 165-page evidence brief. That appendix has never been seen by the public and contains further allegations against the former president.Trump's lawyers had requested that \"no further disclosures\" of \"so-called evidence\" be released because it had been \"unlawfully cherry-picked and mischaracterized\" by the prosecutor's office.",

    "content": "With the 2024 US Presidential Election nearing, third-party candidates Jill Stein and Chase Oliver could influence key battleground states. Democrats worry Stein could benefit Trump's reelection, prompting targeted ads. Both Stein and Oliver emphasize alternative policies, impacting the close race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Voter outreach becomes crucial in swaying undecided voters.With just a month left for the high-stakes US Presidential election 2024, third-party and independent presidential candidates are adding an unpredictable element with every battleground state has at least one such candidate on the ballot. As the time for the 2024 US Presidential election draws closer, independent candidates continue to pose fresh challenges for presidential hopefuls Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.Jill Stein of the Green Party and Chase Oliver of the Libertarian Party are polling at about 1% nationally, according to New York Times polling. Same with Chase Oliver, the Libertarian Party candidate. Although these candidates will not win, they could impact the major party candidates' chances in close states through the \"spoiler\" effect.Bernard Tamas, political science professor at Valdosta State University, said, \"This may wind up being very, very close in these key swing states.\"ALSO READ: Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett silent on backing Kamala Harris as US presidential candidate. Has Trump earned their support?Democrats are particularly concerned. Rahna Epting, executive director of MoveOn, said, \"The presidential race could very well come down to a few thousand votes in a handful of states. These third-party candidates -- they still remain a big threat this cycle.\"Democrats worry mostly about Stein. On Friday, the Democratic National Committee released ads in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, stating that \"A vote for Stein is really a vote for Trump.\" Trump has expressed support for Stein at a rally.ALSO READ: This Jupiter moon to become another Earth?In Michigan, Stein and West could pose threats to Harris. West faced challenges in various states, including Georgia, where he was disqualified.Kennedy, who had an unusual campaign, endorsed Trump after dropping out. Despite efforts to remove himself from some ballots, he remains on the ballots in Wisconsin and Michigan.Stein will appear on ballots in 38 states, including key battlegrounds. Media representatives for the Green Party did not respond for comments, but Stein claimed, \"The system is complicated by design.\"The Democratic National Committee released its first-ever television ad targeting Jill Stein as a spoiler who only benefits Donald Trump's reelection. The ad follows Stein's growing support among Arab Americans and Muslims in battleground states like Michigan, Arizona and Wisconsin where they have large populations.\"The Democrats have lost the Muslim American and the Arab American vote,\" Stein told Reuters after a rally attended by about 100 people in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn on Sunday. \"They're going to be losing enough swing states that they will not win and they cannot win.\"ALSO READ: Stunning discovery in Denmark: 50 exceptionally well preserved skeletons unearthed. Do they hint at hidden society?Jill Stein, an activist and doctor, announced her presidential run with the Green Party and previously ran for president in 2012 and 2016. Some Democrats believe her campaign in 2016 contributed to Donald Trump's victory. As a candidate, Stein promotes an \"economic bill of rights,\" including universal healthcare and the right to a job. She also advocates for climate change action, abortion access, and transgender rights.Stein recently participated in a protest in Gaza, where she was arrested. Despite her support, she is not expected to win more than 2% of the vote, which could potentially impact Vice President Kamala Harris's chances.In 2016, Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump by fewer votes than Stein received in three key states. Stein has accused Democrats of attempting to keep her off state ballots to maintain their power. Currently, she is on the ballot in at least four states, with her running mate Butch Ware, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.At a rally in June, Trump praised Stein. \"I like her very much,\" he said. \"You know why? She takes 100% from them.\"Stein argues that people often vote \"against someone they dislike\" rather than for someone they truly support.ALSO READ: Meet the most beautiful women in the world. Know the science behind their beautyChase Oliver is the Libertarian Party's candidate for president. The Libertarian Party, the third-largest political party in the US, typically draws voters who favor smaller government and more individual freedom. Oliver, a 40-year-old sales executive from Georgia, previously ran for Congress.Oliver argues that voters no longer want to choose \"the lesser of two evils.\" His campaign platform includes balancing the federal budget, ending military support to Israel and Ukraine, closing US military bases overseas, and abolishing the death penalty.Libertarian candidates generally secure 1-3% of the vote, mainly drawing support from Republicans. In the 2020 presidential election, the Libertarian candidate's votes in three key battleground states outnumbered the margin by which Donald Trump lost those states. If those votes had gone to Trump, he might have won those states and potentially altered the overall election outcome.Wisconsin has a particularly crowded ballot. In addition to Trump and Harris, voters will be able to choose among Stein and Oliver; Cornel West, a theologian and independent candidate; Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the former independent candidate who now backs Trump; Randall Terry, the nominee for the Constitution Party; and Claudia De la Cruz, the nominee for the Party for Socialism and Liberation.Julia Azari, political science professor at Marquette University, said, \"Any story we try to tell about that will be based on assumptions about what candidate they might have preferred as a second choice.\"Democrats have also targeted outside candidates by challenging ballot applications with mixed results. Epting mentioned they are now focused on direct voter outreach, saying, \"The more we engage the voters, especially hard-to-reach voters on this election, and talk to them about Kamala Harris' agenda for this country, that is an incredibly effective strategy.\"Additionally, Democrats have accused Republican operatives of assisting outsider candidates like West. Edwin DeJesus of the West campaign denied these allegations.",

Rory McIlroy became an early victim of the trend with one pundit comparing his U.S. Open choke job earlier this year to Kamala Harris' failures within the media.During Sunday's edition of 'This Week' on ABC, political analyst Reince Priebus brought up the fact that Republicans are leading Democrats in the ABC/IPSOS poll for the first time in 32 years.Priebus went on to deliver a strong opinion that Harris' messaging and inability to say anything meaningful in front of a camera, followed by her failed attempt at stopping the bleeding, is turning voters off. This then led him into lobbing a stray in McIlroy's direction.\"She had a terrible week,\" Priebus said of Harris. \"She picked a pointless fight with Ron DeSantis, she's losing in the Sun Belt, and she tried to recover by going on 'The View' which a lot of women watch.\"\"She wanted to clarify the two most important issues that are facing these two candidates, the economy and immigration, and she bombed like Rory  at the U.S. Open and she went on there and said that there was nothing she would do that would be different than Joe Biden and she created a campaign commercial for Donald Trump.\"Harris' appearance on 'The View' should have been the layup of all layups for her campaign, yet it turned into a dumpster fire with her admitting that she wouldn't change a single thing the Biden administration implemented.McIlroy's collapse at Pinehurst this summer was one of the most shocking we've seen in recent sports history, yet Harris moving backward in certain polls after appearing on an anti-Trump, anti-Republican talk show could prove to be even worse.",

    "title": "Illinois officials battle misinformation to protect integrity of November election",
    "content": "At the Sulzer Regional Library on a recent Wednesday night, an informational video and hands-on demonstration tried to ease voters' concerns with a blunt message: \"You can trust the voting machines.\"But the less than a dozen attendees, huddled in a semicircle around a voting machine, still had plenty of questions about what would come next on Election Day.They wondered: How are election judges vetted? Is there any way an election judge could sabotage somebody's vote? How protected are city servers from being hacked? Are governments like Russia and China accessing voting records?It was the first of three voting machine demonstrations the Chicago Board of Elections is hosting in the run-up to the Nov. 5 election, where election security is at the forefront of voters' minds.Russian influence and false claims of a rigged election plagued the last two presidential elections. This time, Illinois election officials said disinformation poses the biggest threat to the integrity of the vote.Bad actors both domestically and abroad \"re trying to get into the minds of voters, and they're trying to pit voters against each other,\" said Matt Dietrich, spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections.Through The Democracy Solutions Project, WBEZ, the Chicago Sun-Times and the University of Chicago's Center for Effective Government at the Harris School of Public Policy are examining the challenges to our democracy and potential solutions in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election.Illinois, a reliably blue state that has voted for the Democratic nominee in the last eight presidential elections, hasn't seen the same specters of conspiracy theories and allegations of fraud that have taken root in states like Arizona and Georgia.Case in point: A state-commissioned task force was created in 2022 to issue recommendations to combat foreign interference and cyberattacks in the run-up to the November election. It never even saw members appointed.Finding available experts who weren't already involved in similar efforts \"proved to be difficult,\" said John Patterson, spokesman for Illinois Senate President Don Harmon, and lawmakers didn't want to get in the way of the State Board of Elections' own security efforts.\"So the decision was made to shift gears and work directly with state elections officials and the Illinois Attorney General's office to identify issues and concerns as they pop up and address them through the legislative process,\" Patterson said in a statement, pointing to a recent state law that addressed publication of voters' personal information.In parts of the country, election authorities are adding bulletproof glass and panic buttons. Illinois officials say they're taking precautions -- though less extreme ones, from having Narcan on hand in case of fentanyl-laced suspicious packages to adding security officers for election sites and giving election workers more protections, like leaving their names off IDs. The FBI is investigating suspicious packages received by the Illinois State Board of Elections and officials across the country, although Chicago and Cook County said they had not received similar threats.\"We do have to prepare for the worst,\" Chicago Board of Elections spokesman Max Bever said. \"No matter what.\"In addition to election judges and poll watchers, over 400 polling place investigators, who are often off-duty or retired law enforcement, are hired for early voting and Election Day in Chicago, Bever said. The Cook County clerk's office has increased physical security for early voting sites, mail ballot deliveries and pickups and at the operations center and main office, said Edmund Michalowski, the Cook County deputy clerk of elections. Security will be provided through the Cook County Sheriff's Office and a private security firm.\"We doubled it for this 2024 November for two reasons,\" Michalowski said. \"One, that obviously the election is a really hot topic around the country. But also, it's going to probably be close to 70% turnout, so it's nice to have more people ... that we can make sure that we have enough people on site to take care of the needs of the voters.\"A new provision in state law went into effect in July that no longer requires election judges to have their name displayed on ID badges, in an attempt to shield workers from personal retribution, Dietrich said.Illinois voters will also be weighing whether to give election workers more protections through an advisory referendum on the November ballot. It asks whether candidates should be subject to civil penalties for attempting to interfere with an election worker's duties. State Rep. Jay Hoffman, who sponsored the legislation putting the question before voters, said that could encompass anything from threats to acts of violence against workers.\"It's one thing to allege fraud. It's another thing to threaten an election worker,\" Hoffman said. \"First of all, it's against every democratic principle we have ever, as a country, stood for. But secondly, it's going to have a chilling effect.\"Voting equipment is also getting more enhancements. Each of the more than 1,400 large metal cabinets which house voting equipment to be sent to each precinct across the suburbs is now equipped with a GPS tracking device, \"so we know exactly where it is,\" Michalowski said.After Russian hackers infiltrated Illinois' voter registration database in 2016, the Illinois State Board of Elections has created a division of information security, partnered with the Illinois National Guard to tap its cybersecurity experts and bolstered resources and training for election authorities throughout the state.At the voting demonstration, Bever ticked through the many layers of safeguards that are already in place.Each election machine undergoes tests. They are never connected to the internet. Officials keep a strict chain of custody, documenting each person who has inspected a machine. Voting equipment and ballots are secured and transported under video surveillance. Chicago has no drive-through drop boxes. Paper ballots are only printed by approved shops to ensure they meet specifications and can be read by scanners.\"Illinois is still an all-paper-ballot state, so no matter which way you vote, either on a touch screen or by paper ballot, there's always going to be a paper trail,\" Bever said. \"And that's important, because paper ballots can be reviewed for audits and recounts as necessary, and the voter can always review their choices on the ballots.\"But Bever called for more funding to safeguard ballots, arguing that it's getting more expensive to keep up with sophisticated threats.During the COVID-19 pandemic, West Ridge resident Mary Dudek witnessed misinformation around the coronavirus and vaccines unfold in real time at the federally qualified health center where she worked. It was staggering and disappointing, she said. Now she fears it's happening again -- this time with the election.\"I was shocked by how impacted we all were from that misinformation, and now I'm seeing that same kind of process unfolding again,\" Dudek said. \"So it's very worrisome.\"A recent poll by the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that a majority surveyed (78%) feel the spread of misinformation about the government is a major problem. Of those surveyed, 39% found it very or somewhat difficult to know if what candidates are saying is true or not.At the voting machine demonstration at Sulzer library, Dudek was hoping to learn more strategies to help the average person sift through the noise.\"It's just one thing after another. And if you are trying to stay on top of things, these are challenging times, because there's so much that is painful going on,\" she said.Nonpartisan voting groups and election authorities are launching new concerted efforts to help voters discern for themselves. The Illinois Attorney General's Office offers tips on how to spot artificially generated images. Public service announcements sponsored by the Illinois State Board of Elections are airing across hundreds of radio and television stations in Illinois; they encourage voters to turn to their election authorities for the most trusted info.\"We do not want to alienate them or create this 'us against you' environment where they feel like they're being insulted,\" Dietrich said, noting he avoids using terms like \"election denier.\" \"We want to get them back to where they always were before, where inherently, they trusted elections -- that elections in the United States are secure.\"The League of Women Voters of Illinois has marshaled its members to debunk common myths and teach media literacy through its new Mis/Disinformation Task Force. Its website features a toolkit and talks from experts on everything from protecting democracy in the age of social media and artificial intelligence to talking with people who disagree with you.\"If you argue with people, that doesn't work. What works is listening to them, asking questions, asking them to start questioning on their own,\" said Anne Sullivan, co-chair of the Mis/Disinformation Task Force.Barb Laimins, co-chair of the task force, has a new motto that is an old adage of journalists: If your mother says she loves you, check it out. If people have questions about election security, Laimins said there's no better way to get answers than signing up to work as an election judge.\"When you become an election judge, you become the perfect purveyor of accurate information and support of our election systems,\" Laimins said.",

    "content": "This article contains a discussion of sexual assault.Former President of the United States and \"Home Alone 2\" actor Donald Trump isn't happy about how he's portrayed in the explosive new biopic \"The Apprentice.\" The movie, which stars Sebastian Stan as Trump, takes a searing look at Trump's real-estate career in New York in the 1970s and 1980s, and though it's not exactly clear if Trump has seen the film, he does not like it.The film officially released in the United States on Friday, October 11, and Trump quickly took to Truth Social, his social media platform, to put the movie on blast. (Any and all grammatical errors, errant capitalizations, and typos are the presidential candidate's own.)\"A FAKE and CLASSLESS Movie written about me, called, 'The Apprentice' (Do they even have the right to use that name without approval?), will hopefully 'bomb,'\" the Republican candidate for president wrote. \"It's a cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country, 'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!'\"Trump then addressed some of the film's darker elements, including a scene that depicts him sexually assaulting his first wife, the late Ivana Trump (played by Maria Bakalova in the film). \"My former wife, Ivana, was a kind and wonderful person, and I had a great relationship with her until the day she died,\" he continued. \"The writer of this pile of garbage, Gabe Sherman, a lowlife and talentless hack, who has long been widely discredited, knew that, but chose to ignore it.

Ivana died in 2022.Screenwriter Gabriel Sherman told Entertainment Weekly that the \"most shocking\" moments in the film are all based on \"real events.\" \"The funny thing is, everything in the movie that seems the most shocking is actually completely based on real events,\" he said. \"Very little has been dramatized. It's one of these stories where the truth is stranger than fiction.\"What was the relationship between Trump and Roy Cohn?Sherman said there was a father-son dynamic to their relationship but on another level, there was a \"homoerotic subtext\". \"One of the things I found in my research is that a lot of Roy's lovers were young, blond, blue-eyed men who bore a striking resemblance to young Donald. I think Roy was attracted to Trump, in a way, and this movie is sort of a love story,\" Sherman said.Did Trump 'rape' Ivana?USA Today reported that there is a stomach-churning scene in the movie where Donald tells Ivana that he's no longer attracted to her. Ivana retorts that Donald is fat and balding. \"Donald throws Ivana to the floor and climbs on top of her, proceeding to sexually assault his wife as she screams for him to stop,\" the report said.\"The alleged rape is taken from a court deposition \"that Ivana gave under oath during her 1990 divorce,\" Sherman said. \"In fact, the scene she described in the divorce papers was actually far more graphic and brutal than the one we dramatized in the film.\"At TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Shop now and get 10% off with code RB10. Vet & LEO-founded.Trump emphasized that the decision was unanimous, describing it as \"thousands of people\" coming together in support.Paul Perez, the president of the National Border Patrol Council, joined Trump on stage to address the crowd.Perez delivered a strong message, warning of the consequences if Kamala Harris wins the 2024 election. \"If we allow border czar Harris to win this election, every city, every community in this great country is going to go to hell,\" Perez said, citing the influx of unvetted individuals who have entered the country, leading to increased crime rates including \"murders, rapes, robberies, and burglaries.\"Perez voiced his support for Trump as the only candidate capable of resolving the border crisis. \"Only one man can fix that. That is Donald J. Trump,\" he told the crowd, adding that Trump has consistently stood by the men and women protecting the border and risking their lives for the country.Perez also emphasized the stark choice voters face in November: either allow the chaos to continue at the southern border with criminal cartels controlling drug and human trafficking, or vote to restore order.He highlighted the threat posed by the smuggling of drugs, particularly fentanyl, which has devastated communities across the nation.\"On behalf of the 16,000 men and women represented by the National Border Patrol Council, we strongly support and endorse Donald J. Trump for President of the United States,\" Perez declared, signaling the union's firm backing for Trump.Following the endorsement, Trump expressed his appreciation for the council, calling them an \"incredible group of people\" and reiterating his commitment to supporting the agents who protect the U.S. border.As Trump continues to campaign for votes in key battleground states, he took the opportunity at the rally to criticize Kamala Harris and vowed never to allow the U.S. military to become \"woke.\" During the event, Trump also showed a clip from the film Full Metal Jacket on a screen behind him, featuring R. Lee Ermey's drill sergeant character, before humorously transitioning into a mock \"pride month\" announcement.In addition to addressing border security, Trump promised to prioritize reducing violent crime and supporting law enforcement if elected.The rally in Arizona, a critical swing state, is part of Trump's broader effort to galvanize voters ahead of the November 2024 election.According to a recent poll conducted by the Wall Street Journal, the race between Trump and Harris remains extremely close in several key battleground states.The survey, conducted between September 28 and October 8, found that Trump and Harris are tied in North Carolina and Wisconsin, while Harris holds slight leads in Arizona and Georgia.Trump's biggest advantage is in Nevada, where he leads Harris 49% to 43%. Pennsylvania also remains close, with Trump leading 47% to 46%.Voters in the poll indicated they trust Trump more when it comes to handling the economy, inflation, and border security.As the election nears, both candidates are expected to intensify their efforts to win over voters in these key states.The opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of LifeZette.

    "content": "Former president calls film about his rise in real estate in 1970s and 80s a 'politically disgusting hatchet job'Donald Trump railed against a just released biopic about his life in a social media screed early on Monday, calling it a \"cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job\" meant to thwart his presidential candidacy.The Apprentice portrays how Trump created his real estate empire under the tutelage of Roy Cohn, a notoriously cutthroat attorney and power-broker in 1970s and 1980s New York City, Intelligencer notes. Trump is played by the Marvel actor Sebastian Stan and Cohn by the Succession star Jeremy Strong.Trump's ex-wife Ivana Trump is played by Maria Bakalova - whose breakout role in Borat Subsequent Moviefilm landed her an Academy award nomination. There is a disclaimer at the beginning of The Apprentice indicating that portions were \"fictionalized for dramatic purposes\", Intelligencer notes.In his rant Trump described the film as \"fake and classless\". Trump said he hoped it would \"bomb\" and alleged that the was \"put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country, 'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!'\"The Apprentice has spurred praise and controversy since its premiere at the Cannes film festival in May. The screenwriter, Gabriel Sherman, described numerous roadblocks in its production.Actors were reluctant to \"humanize\" Trump, Sherman said in Vanity Fair, and Hollywood institutions did not want to fund the project. And, the most significant investor into this project allegedly threatened to kill the film after viewing it.This investor was Dan Snyder, a billionaire who formerly owned the NFL's Washington Commanders and a major Trump supporter. Snyder reportedly invested in The Apprentice through his son-in-law Mark Rapaport's film production company, Variety said.\"He was under the impression that it was a flattering portrayal of the 45th president,\" the outlet reported.The Apprentice is anything but. It contains a scene in which Trump's character appears to sexually assault his first wife, Ivana, takes amphetamines, undergoes liposuction, and receives a hair transplant.Ivana claimed that Trump raped her during a divorce deposition, but later recanted this allegation. Trump has denied attacking Ivana. Trump, who has been found liable of sexually abusing the writer E Jean Carroll in civil court, has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 20 women.Trump's lawyers sent The Apprentice's film-makers cease-and-desist letters, and prominent distributors would not go near it. \"Hollywood fashions itself as a community of truth tellers,\" Sherman said, \"but here they were running from a movie to prepare for a Trump presidency.\"In his social media attack posted just before 1am, Trump focused on the film's depiction of Ivana, who died in July 2022 after an accidental fall.\"My former wife, Ivana, was a kind and wonderful person, and I had a great relationship with her until the day she died,\" Trump wrote. \"The writer of this pile of garbage, Gabe Sherman, a lowlife and talentless hack, who has long been widely discredited, knew that, but chose to ignore it.\"So sad that HUMAN SCUM, like the people involved in this hopefully unsuccessful enterprise, are allowed to say and do whatever they want in order to hurt a Political Movement, which is far bigger than any of us. MAGA2024!\"The film's director, Ali Abbasi, seemed unbothered by Trump's Truth Social invective.\"Thanks for getting back to us @realDonaldTrump,\" Abbasi posted on X this morning, with a screenshot of his post. \"I am available to talk further if you want. Today is a tight day w a lot of press for #TheApprentice but i might be able to give you a call tomorrow.\"Asked to elaborate on Trump's statement, his campaign pointed to Sherman's comments about fictionalization in the film.\"The filmmakers now readily admit they fabricated scenes and created fake stories to fit some deranged narrative about President Trump that is completely untrue. This garbage is pure fiction which sensationalizes lies that have been long debunked,\" Steven Cheung, Trump campaign communications director, said in a statement.Cheung likened the film to purported \"witch-hunts\" by his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, saying it was \"election interference by Hollywood elites right before November, who know that President Trump will retake the White House and beat their candidate of choice because nothing they have done has worked.\"This 'film' is pure malicious defamation, should never see the light of day, and doesn't even deserve a place in the straight-to-DVD section of a bargain bin at a soon-to-be-closed discount movie store, it belongs in a dumpster fire,\" Cheung also said.",

As the time for the 2024 US Presidential election draws closer, independent candidates continue to pose fresh challenges for presidential hopefuls Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.Jill Stein of the Green Party and Chase Oliver of the Libertarian Party are polling at about 1% nationally, according to New York Times polling. Same with Chase Oliver, the Libertarian Party candidate. Although these candidates will not win, they could impact the major party candidates' chances in close states through the \"spoiler\" effect.Bernard Tamas, political science professor at Valdosta State University, said, \"This may wind up being very, very close in these key swing states.\"ALSO READ: Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett silent on backing Kamala Harris as US presidential candidate. Has Trump earned their support?Democrats are particularly concerned. Rahna Epting, executive director of MoveOn, said, \"The presidential race could very well come down to a few thousand votes in a handful of states. These third-party candidates -- they still remain a big threat this cycle.\"Democrats worry mostly about Stein. On Friday, the Democratic National Committee released ads in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, stating that \"A vote for Stein is really a vote for Trump.\" Trump has expressed support for Stein at a rally.ALSO READ: This Jupiter moon to become another Earth?In Michigan, Stein and West could pose threats to Harris.

Despite efforts to remove himself from some ballots, he remains on the ballots in Wisconsin and Michigan.Stein will appear on ballots in 38 states, including key battlegrounds. Media representatives for the Green Party did not respond for comments, but Stein claimed, \"The system is complicated by design.\"The Democratic National Committee released its first-ever television ad targeting Jill Stein as a spoiler who only benefits Donald Trump's reelection. The ad follows Stein's growing support among Arab Americans and Muslims in battleground states like Michigan, Arizona and Wisconsin where they have large populations.\"The Democrats have lost the Muslim American and the Arab American vote,\" Stein told Reuters after a rally attended by about 100 people in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn on Sunday. \"They're going to be losing enough swing states that they will not win and they cannot win.\"ALSO READ: Stunning discovery in Denmark: 50 exceptionally well preserved skeletons unearthed. Do they hint at hidden society?Jill Stein, an activist and doctor, announced her presidential run with the Green Party and previously ran for president in 2012 and 2016. Some Democrats believe her campaign in 2016 contributed to Donald Trump's victory. As a candidate, Stein promotes an \"economic bill of rights,\" including universal healthcare and the right to a job. She also advocates for climate change action, abortion access, and transgender rights.Stein recently participated in a protest in Gaza, where she was arrested. Despite her support, she is not expected to win more than 2% of the vote, which could potentially impact Vice President Kamala Harris's chances.In 2016, Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump by fewer votes than Stein received in three key states. Stein has accused Democrats of attempting to keep her off state ballots to maintain their power. Currently, she is on the ballot in at least four states, with her running mate Butch Ware, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.At a rally in June, Trump praised Stein. \"I like her very much,\" he said. \"You know why? She takes 100% from them.\"Stein argues that people often vote \"against someone they dislike\" rather than for someone they truly support.ALSO READ: Meet the most beautiful women in the world. Know the science behind their beautyChase Oliver is the Libertarian Party's candidate for president. The Libertarian Party, the third-largest political party in the US, typically draws voters who favor smaller government and more individual freedom. Oliver, a 40-year-old sales executive from Georgia, previously ran for Congress.Oliver argues that voters no longer want to choose \"the lesser of two evils.\" His campaign platform includes balancing the federal budget, ending military support to Israel and Ukraine, closing US military bases overseas, and abolishing the death penalty.Libertarian candidates generally secure 1-3% of the vote, mainly drawing support from Republicans. In the 2020 presidential election, the Libertarian candidate's votes in three key battleground states outnumbered the margin by which Donald Trump lost those states. If those votes had gone to Trump, he might have won those states and potentially altered the overall election outcome.Wisconsin has a particularly crowded ballot. In addition to Trump and Harris, voters will be able to choose among Stein and Oliver; Cornel West, a theologian and independent candidate; Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the former independent candidate who now backs Trump; Randall Terry, the nominee for the Constitution Party; and Claudia De la Cruz, the nominee for the Party for Socialism and Liberation.Julia Azari, political science professor at Marquette University, said, \"Any story we try to tell about that will be based on assumptions about what candidate they might have preferred as a second choice.\"Democrats have also targeted outside candidates by challenging ballot applications with mixed results. Epting mentioned they are now focused on direct voter outreach, saying, \"The more we engage the voters, especially hard-to-reach voters on this election, and talk to them about Kamala Harris' agenda for this country, that is an incredibly effective strategy.\"Additionally, Democrats have accused Republican operatives of assisting outsider candidates like West. Edwin DeJesus of the West campaign denied these allegations.",

    "title": "Capitalism, Crisis, and the 2024 Election | Common Dreams",
    "content": "This is the second-ever presidential election as conscious adults for many young folks. I remember during my first, in 2020, I was freshly 18 and brimming with an almost egoistic confidence in my decision to abstain from voting. I did not have faith in either the Democratic Party or their nominee, Joe Biden, to represent me.Four years later, my view of the Democratic Party has only worsened, especially as Palestinian blood continues to spill by their hands. And yet, at the same time, the threat of fascism from the Republican Party is becoming ever more real. The far-right has intensified its attacks on the bodily autonomy of women, the LGTBQ community, and on the rotting carcass that is American Democracy. Now that I am 22, and in stark contrast to my past self, this election leaves me writhing in a pool of self-doubt. The same question repeats over and over in my head: Can I really sit this one out?It is within this tension that I found myself sitting down with three next-system thinkers about the upcoming election. These activists and scholars have dedicated their lives to challenging systemic poverty and economic injustice through decades of combined experience in grassroots organizing in the United States. Our discussion touched not only on the significance of the 2024 election but the increasingly acute political crisis in the United States and the current prospects for system change.We're living globally in a period of a profound economic crisis and environmental catastrophe.What I learned, in some ways, reflected my own ambivalence. They too were divided on the question that Bill Fletcher described in our interview as \"the politics of moral outrage versus the politics of power.\" As Cheri Honkala shared with me, it is important that Americans vote their conscience in the face of a genocide carried out in Palestine by the Democratic Party. However, Stephanie Luce offered an opposing perspective, urging the left to \"get realistic about our power\" in the context of an increasingly emboldened, fascistic right wing. Ultimately, what these contrasting tendencies represent is an ongoing historical debate between two different philosophies for the American left.These interviews have been edited for brevity and clarity.Q: There seems to be a general sense that, regardless of who wins the 2024 presidential election, the system as a whole -- the social, ecological, economic, and political system of which we are all a part -- has some very serious issues. What systemic problems do you see today and how serious are they?Cheri Honkola: Our capitalist system has created a situation where people just can't live... People have absolutely no rights to land, no rights to free speech, and no rights to live anywhere. And there's a serious increasing criminalization just of being poor and just of being homeless in this country. People just can't live right now, so people are being forced to set up co-ops and a cooperative economy and all of those kinds of things. And the approach, I think, for folks that are on the absolute bottom, it's a little different. There's a growing equality of misery; we're very clear that there's going to be no utopia under capitalism.Bill Fletcher Jr.: We're living globally in a period of a profound economic crisis and environmental catastrophe, and this convergence runs us into the equivalent of two tectonic plates that are crashing against one another. And in that situation, you have mountains that are built, and you have earthquakes, and we're seeing both, and so this is creating great instability and anxiety.In the United States, in part as a reflection of that, we're living through a cold Civil War. And this cold Civil War really became very evident with Newt Gingrich and the Contract With America, there were clear signs of counterattack against the victories that had been won in the 20th century. Now since then, key elements in the Republican establishment have made use of mass movements on the right that have been developing since the late 60s and have thought that they could manipulate them, but instead, what they've done is follow the course of Dr. Frankenstein in creating a monster that they can't control, and that's why the MAGA movement smacked out of the way the opponents to former U.S. President Donald Trump both in 2016 and this year. So, it's a very dangerous situation, and the danger's compounded by an armed wing of the right-wing authoritarian movement, plus the recklessness of very wealthy men, so it creates a very unstable situation.If we go down a path of authoritarian rule, I don't see any hope for addressing a more functioning economy or a more sustainable climate situation that's going to protect the most impacted.Stephanie Luce: Well, I think it's multidimensional. The crises are from a number of angles. Some of the most pressing issues are certainly related to climate. There is really no way of turning back, so our choices are to slow down the worst of it and mitigate the worst impacts. But in any case, it seems, we're already in it, and a lot of people are already experiencing a climate crisis, and then certainly, there are growing threats to democracy around the world, of people even electing authoritarian leaders and losing faith in democracy. And I would say the U.S. certainly has never had a real democracy even to begin with. So, it's not like I'm romanticizing what came before, but it is possible that even that can go backwards, instead of forwards, in terms of creating a real multiracial democracy. And then how we think about the economy, there are a lot of measures that would suggest things are relatively stable right now, but underneath it is certainly not a sustainable system, it's an economy that's producing for profit instead of human need and producing for growth instead of sustainability. So, I would say those are the underlying crises that will be there no matter what the outcome of the election is.Q: Given what you just shared, what kinds of changes to the system do you see as absolutely necessary? And what changes do you think are opening up that you are really excited about?Cheri: One of the things I see is that this growing equality of misery is a different form of unity that is developing. The ruling class has really figured out how to keep us divided in regard to gender, race, and all of these other kinds of things. And I think that the positive side of the negative is that it's forcing us to figure out how to work together to create something very different in order to stay alive.One of the closest people I work with is an African American male who was formerly homeless and incarcerated, served some time in the military, has seven kids, and is married. There's no way we would have been working together for 30 years just because he's a nice guy. We have nothing in common. But we've had to figure out ways to work together. People need each other desperately in order to stay alive.For us, it's really about organizing. To literally take back land, organize to take back food, working together to demand the other half of the operation for a kid's mouth, and that's why we've just recently written this book Takeover. It's a little bit of our history, but it's also a manual on teaching homeless people across this country how to house themselves in abandoned government homes that are vacant because there are more abandoned properties than there are homeless people. And I think that the other positive thing is that there's so much surplus right now that it really is a question of redistribution and getting organized to take back our human rights.We have to create a block that's capable of winning and introducing substantive, structural changes.Bill: Well, the system itself is a rock, so I start there. Capitalism is antithetical to the future of humanity. Now, on top of that, the U.S. sociopolitical system that's based on or built upon, capitalism is itself rigged against people of color, women, against working-class people. And one of the things about the way it's rigged, particularly when it comes to people of color, is that when we try to play by the rules, the rules get changed. We see this in elections by different things that the Republicans have been doing in terms of voter suppression. You see this in the economy and business. The demand needs to be for consistent democracy, an expansion of democracy into all spheres, not a retraction or a retrenchment, and so we need to make it easier for people to vote, not more difficult. We need to make it easier for workers to form unions, not more difficult. We need to make it easier for women to control their own bodies, not more difficult. We need to make it easier for LGBTQ folks to live their lives in harmony and not more difficult. We need to be addressing the fact that the planet is burning rather than ignoring it. Those are the kinds of things that we need to be doing, and those are the changes that need to be introduced and that we need to demand of our political leaders.Stephanie: Well for me, in a sense, the building of a multiracial democracy is an outcome and a way to address the other two. I don't see how if we go down a path of authoritarian rule, I don't see any hope for addressing a more functioning economy or a more sustainable climate situation that's going to protect the most impacted. So I guess for me, some of my effort has been focusing on deepening and expanding and making democracy real, because I feel like that's one of our only hopes for addressing those other serious crises.I think it's a strange moment of kind of real highs and lows. So, I have been involved myself in a number of efforts to engage more people in this fight around democracy, acknowledging, again, like I said, the ways in which it has failed many of us up until now. It's not about just saying, let's revive the status quo or what's done been before, but can we deepen it and make it more real, whether it's in the workplace, through having a voice at work and even thinking about worker control, whether it's in our communities, and thinking about what it would look like if we had people who are most impacted making real decisions about things like housing and transportation.Some of the training and discussion about what democracy could look like, the ways in which it's failed us, and the historic role that working people have played in fighting off authoritarian governments, I think that's interesting. There are people definitely worried about that and engaged in that. My other arena is particularly around worker organizing, just tons of interest. I've never seen this level of interest in the entire time I've worked on this, particularly among young people, about how it's not just about fighting for things, like a union that's important, but like, really questioning, why do we even work at all? What is it for? What's the purpose of work, and who makes the decisions about how the economy runs?Q: Staying on the theme of new possibilities: What kinds of new combinations do you see as possible -- unusual allies, new ways of coming together, new sets of approaches -- in the 2020s that may have been more difficult to achieve in the past?Cheri: Well, there really is this thing that we call a growing, developing new class. And so that's like a nurse friend of mine that just figured she was going to be a nurse the rest of her life and everything would be great. And now she's an older woman, and she couldn't figure out the technology, and so she was replaced by a bunch of younger people that are going into nursing that were born and raised with computers. Or it's the person that has worked someplace, and they've totally eliminated that industry that used to pay enough so you could have a two-car garage or thought that they were going to be great for the rest of their life because they worked at a union and paid union dues their whole life, and then they close down that shop. These are the new people that are coming to the bottom and that we're working together with, and that's a huge fall. And these are people who really believe that they have an entitlement.You know capitalism has really done a job on poor people period, to have them believe that they don't really deserve any of these things, and they don't have rights, and they've been individual failures, and it's not a part of a larger system. And I think that that's harder to buy when you're part of this growing new class of people that are becoming expendable.Bill: We have been witnessing the rise of new and renovated social movements. We have not yet built a conscious majoritarian block that can win power. That's what we need to do. We need to first block or stop MAGA, but stopping MAGA is not enough. We have to create a block that's capable of winning and introducing substantive, structural changes.I think that the two corporate political parties in this country are going to fight like hell to remain relevant.So, I'm not sure that there are any new combinations as such. It's more about making the combinations more conscious and standing up against ethno-nationalism and identity-exclusive politics.Stephanie: On the one hand, there are a lot of young people, and not just only young people, but a lot of energy from young people looking to rebuild an internationalist movement particularly focused on Gaza, but that brings people to renew their interest in learning about other parts of the world, and we do have more tools to communicate across borders and talk to and learn from activists across the globe. So that's a positive place for me. I also think there are a number of issues that are really contentious, but actually kind of divide our political parties or divide our coalitions. I think immigration is one, for example, it tends to be portrayed as if there's a Republican position and a Democratic position. I don't actually think that's true.I think there's actually a lot of division within the Democratic Party and also division within the Republican Party, because a lot of people who are truly Christian or religious have a belief in rights. Employers, for example, have historically been wanting to embrace immigrants and bring more immigrants to the country. So, there's these issues that divide the coalitions as they stand and could make space for reconfiguration of new alliances, certainly also around things like healthcare, that crosses party lines. And it's more about 1% versus 99% -- and climate as well, I think climate is another area of possibly renewed alliances, and some of that's generational, but it's also about some people's values that that they hold and it's like, Okay, actually, the parties aren't speaking for these values.Q: It looks like system change is coming whether we like it or not. There are endless possibilities for what the next system might look like, good and bad. What do you see as the organizing and movement building challenges that absolutely must be overcome in order to build a better world?Cheri: I think we're in an in-between stage right now, and those who are already facing fascism are terrified and having to confront that. That's immigrants in this country, and people that are already living behind bars. And neighborhoods like Kensington are already dealing with a system where the government and the police there and the politicians are all working together, and where they have mobile jails, and there is no due process, and there is no media covering our day-to-day reality. Like in Kensington and other areas of the country, they want absolute control, there already has been a genocide of different sections of the population with the fentanyl crisis, and more people have died now from fentanyl than died during the Vietnam War. And that is crippling people and killing people, and nothing is being done about it.I think that the two corporate political parties in this country are going to fight like hell to remain relevant. They will buy or offer cabinet positions or large amounts of resources for their organizations to divert the population from system change and keep them in some kind of reform. Have the people's leaders take them in the direction of reform. So, what you see happening now in this country is the immense threat of anybody that's talking about the creation of a different kind of system, versus getting on the bandwagon for Kamala Harris. I have so many Democrat bots on my social media. It's like a full-time job for them. I'm old enough to remember back in the day when there was a real anti-war movement in this country, and you would never think of any civil rights organizations not being involved. There are so many people who are in the financial pockets right now of the Democratic Party for their places of faith. While, literally, children are being slaughtered and the genocide is going on in Gaza; it's just devastating.Internally, I think we need to really up our internal training about long-term strategy and be realistic about our power.Bill: One of the big dangers is purism. We see it in the electoral realm all the time, and it's the idea that if a politician does not have exactly my platform, they are a sellout and not worthy of support. It's also reflective of the politics of moral outrage versus the politics of power. So, the politics of moral outrage are represented by \"we are furious about this, that, or whatever, and therefore we're not going to vote for this candidate, or we're not going to vote at all.\" And that view is objectively apocalyptic. Basically, it means that no change can come about until there's a total collapse. And some people believe that you have this kind of pure streak that is waiting. I often analogize it to a surfer who paddles out into the ocean waiting for the ideal wave, believing that once they get it, they can ride it straight into shore. And that's not politics. That's something else. Sectarianism is related. It's sort of the notion that it's my way or the highway.Mountain Stronghold Mentality is something that Bill Gallegos and I have written about, and it's a notion that comes from an era in the Chinese Revolution when there were guerrilla bands that were literally on mountaintops that would be their base area. They'd come down and attack the enemy and then go back to the base areas. The revolution shifted, and they needed mobile units to engage the enemy in a different way. Many of the guerrilla commanders didn't want to come down from mountaintops, because they were comfortable. They were secure. They didn't believe that they could be captured or destroyed by the enemy, and so they basically, despite the change in conditions, sought comfort. We see this with organizations that are afraid to take risks and to unite with others because they're comfortable where they are.Another problem is the lack of strategy and strategic thinking. We progressives are very used to fighting defensive battles when we have difficulty thinking offensively. So, I'll give you an example. I often use this example. A number of years ago, maybe 10 years ago, I was in Texas on a speaking engagement, and it was before  Abbott was elected governor. And so, I was giving a talk about something, and during the Q and A, people were telling me how bad the situation was in Texas. So, I listened. They wanted to know what I thought needed to be done. And I said, How do we take over Texas? They took a deep breath, sat back, couldn't figure out what I was thinking, whether I had lost my mind, and I said to them, look, you've told me how bad the situation is. I get it. We have two alternatives. One, we can give up, go off, and get high, right? The other is that we develop a strategy to win. And the strategy to win needs to look at everything, from which are the key cities in Texas, which are the key counties, which are the counties that we can afford to ignore? What are the social movements that are in operation? Who are the key opinion makers? Where can resources be obtained? All of these things. And then read a little bit of Sun Tzu, you know The Art of War, and think strategically about how we win.Stephanie: Oh, there's so many. Yeah. I mean, this is a long list, but for me, I sometimes think about it as, what do we need to do internally, within our organizations and movements? I think we need to think about that. And then there's the set of external challenges. And so internally, I think we need to really up our internal training about long-term strategy and be realistic about our power. A lot of us don't have power, and instead, we tend to look for a moral stance like, what's the right thing to do? That's important, but if it doesn't come with building power, then it's not a strategy. I worked on this book called Practical Radicals because people have tended to be either radicals with big dreams and visions but with no plan to win, or very pragmatic and with a small, winnable goal, but it's too small to really change much. So, I think as organizations and movements, we have to really get better trained on how to do long-term strategy, and that includes also getting better about how to work in alliance with one another across our organizations and sectors where we don't agree on everything. People in the climate movement might not share the same goals and visions as some people in labor unions, for example, but we have to find those common-ground ways in which we're all better off. We're stronger together than we are apart.And then I think the external challenges are massive. Because the U.S. state is well armed and powerful. The police state is massive. People will be deported, shot at, arrested. So, we have to be realistic about the powers that we are up against, not just in the United States, but globally. And really also get strategic about how to divide that ruling coalition. They don't all benefit from it, or they benefit unequally, and that means that we need to think about peeling off certain segments of that. That means working with people we really don't like and whom we disagree with on a lot of things, but we might share common end goals, such as climate sustainability or defending democracy as a system. So those external threats are real, and we just don't have the power on our own to really make those kinds of changes.",

Many include language in effect blaming Iran for the 10/7 attacks. Some explicitly or implicitly frame the Hamas attack as an attack on the Jewish people (as opposed to on Israel/Israelis). Many include support for Israel's war on Gaza, its war on Lebanon, and its impending attack on Iran. Many talk about the imperative for the US to stand with Israel until \"victory\" Many talk about Israeli hostages and the imperative to save them, notwithstanding the fact that the Israeli government appears to have long ago written them off as necessary collateral damage in its war on Gaza. A very small number mention Palestinian suffering and casualties, or anything about restraint, de-escalation, ceasefire, concern over regional war, or criticize the Israeli govt, etc.... Some use the anniversary to double down on conflating protest of Israel/Zionism/Israel's actions post-Oct 7, especially on US campuses, with antisemitism and vowed to shut down such protests.

That may have delayed the ability of the producers to obtain a distributor, but once they did, Trump and his team have yet to file any litigation.The Apprentice tells of the early days of Trump in 1970s and 80s Manhattan, where Roy Cohn teaches his \"apprentice\" how to fight back against a federal lawsuit alleging that Trump and his father engaged in discrimination against Black applicants seeking to rent housing from them.The most objectionable scene appears to be one where Trump (Sebastian Stan) sexually assaults his then-wife Ivana. The scene is based on one of Ivana Trump's depositions, which she later said was made during a period of \"high tension\" during their divorce proceedings and \"totally without merit\".Trump wrote, \"A FAKE and CLASSLESS Movie written about me, called, The Apprentice (Do they even have the right to use that name without approval?), will hopefully \"bomb.\" It's a cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country, 'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!'\"The Apprentice opened to a lackluster $1.58 million at the box office over the weekend.One of the figures portrayed in the movie -- Roger Stone, a longtime Trump ally who helped steer him to a career in politics -- actually praised the portrayals.",

    "title": "A devastating hurricane doesn't dramatically change how people vote - but in a close election, it can matter",
    "content": "North Carolina and Florida are changing administrative rules and, in some cases, issuing emergency funding that is intended to make it easier for people in areas damaged by Hurricanes Helene and Milton to vote.The recovery in both states is expected to extend far beyond the November 2024 election period. The majority of the people in the affected communities in North Carolina and Florida voted for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in 2020, making some election analysts wonder if some Trump supporters will be able to cast their ballots.Amy Lieberman, a politics and society editor at The Conversation U.S., spoke with Boris Heersink, a scholar of voters' behavior after a natural disaster, to better understand if and how the recent hurricanes could shift the results of the 2024 presidential election.A massive hurricane disrupts people's lives in many important ways, including affecting people's personal safety and where they can live. Ahead of an election, there are a lot of practical limitations about how an election can be executed - like if a person can still receive mail-in ballots at home or elsewhere, or if it is possible to still vote in person at their polling location if that building was destroyed or damaged.Another issue is whether people who have just lived through a natural disaster and will likely be dealing with the aftermath for weeks to come are focused on politics right now. Some might sit out the election because they simply have more important things to worry about.The other side of the equation, which is what political scientists like myself are mostly focusing on, is whether people take the fact that a natural disaster happened into consideration when they vote.Two scholars, Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels, have argued that sometimes voters are not great at figuring out how to incorporate bad things that happened to them into a voting position. In some cases, it is entirely fair to hold an elected official responsible for bad outcomes that affect people's lives. But at other moments, bad things can happen to us without that being the fault of an incumbent president or governor. And voters should ideally be able to balance out these different types of bad things - those it is fair to punish elected officials for, and those for which it isn't fair to hold them responsible.After all, a devastating hurricane is terrible, but it is not Kamala Harris' fault that it happened. But Achen and Bartels argue that voters frequently still punish elected officials for random bad events like this.Their most famous example is the consequences of a series of shark attacks off the New Jersey coast in the summer of 1916. As a result of those attacks, the New Jersey tourism industry saw a major decline. While these findings are still being debated, Achen and Bartels argue that Jersey shore voters subsequently voted against Woodrow Wilson in the 1916 presidential election at a higher rate than they would have had the shark attacks not happened. They argue that voters did this even though Wilson had no involvement in the shark attacks.Scholars like John Gasper and Andrew Reeves argue that voters mostly care whether elected officials respond appropriately to a disaster. So, if the president does a good job reacting, voters do not actually punish them at all in the next election. However, voters can punish elected officials if they feel like the response is not correct.The fact that Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana in 2005 was not the fault of then-President George W. Bush. But the perceived slowness of the government response is something a voter could have held him responsible for.Colleagues and I have shown that how people interpret the combination of a disaster and the government response is likely colored by their own partisanship.We looked at both the effects of Superstorm Sandy on the 2012 presidential election and natural disasters' impact on elections more broadly from 1972 through 2004. One core finding is that when presidents reject state officials' disaster declaration requests, they lose votes in affected counties - but only if those counties were already more supportive of the opposite party.If there is a strong positive government response, the incumbent president or their party can actually gain votes or lose voters affected by a disaster. So, Republicans affected by the hurricanes could become more inclined to vote against Harris if they feel like they are not getting the help they need. But it could also help Harris if affected Democrats feel like they are getting enough aid.The major takeaway is that if the government responds really effectively to a natural disaster or other emergency, there is not a huge electoral penalty - and there could even be a small reward.That is not irrelevant in a close election. If Republicans in affected areas in North Carolina feel the government response has been poor and it inspires them to turn out in higher numbers to punish Harris, that could matter. But if they feel like the response has been adequate, research suggests either no real effect on their support for Harris - or possibly even an increase in Harris voters.Scholars mostly assume that people affected can tell whether the government response was good or not. Trump and other Republicans are falsely saying that the response is slow and falsely claiming that Federal Emergency Management Agency money is being spent on immigrants who are not living in the country legally. There does not appear to be a slow government response to the hurricane in North Carolina, and there's no evidence the response is insufficient in Florida, either.So, the question now is whether voters affected by these hurricanes will respond based on their actual lived experiences, or how they are told they are living their experience.This article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and trustworthy analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.

    "title": "Carrasquillo: Kamala is 'brat'",
    "content": "Opinion: \"Brat summer\" has officially affected us, and it's a very important (political) matter. Whether you're a Charli XCX stan or voting blue this November, here's why it carries importance.A diverse electorate of nearly 41 million \"young voters,\" according t0 Tufts University, will shape the 2024 presidential election this year. This is electrifying news for the Democratic Party, which has recently stirred the pot with President Biden's drop from the race and the Democratic Party nominating current Vice President Kamala Harris for president.A recent study conducted by SSRS for CNN found that nearly 75% of voters in the United States believed the Democratic Party would have a better chance at winning the presidency in 2024 with someone other than Joe Biden at the forefront of the ballot.Harris is nipping at former President Trump's heels in a hypothetical showdown. Trump is polling at 46% among registered voters while Harris is at 49% according to a New York Times poll from Oct. 11, which means an Olympic contest on our hands as we advance closer to the 2024 election.Harris's edge over Trump is fueled largely by a surge in support from women. Polling data reveals that 50% of female voters prefer Harris over Trump when compared to 44% who favored Biden over the same combatant, suggesting a photo finish come November. When University of Oregon students were approached on the matter, the prospect of a female president held great allure.\"The appeal that a woman can be anything she wants to be. That is what 'brat' means to me.\" UO journalism master's candidate Saida Guzman said. This year's election might be one of the most important elections to date. At least, for the sake of democracy.\"A woman can do whatever the fuck a man can do, and can probably do it better. Not only a woman but a woman of color. That would be so phenomenal,\" UO student Abby Snethen said when asked about the potential of a female candidate claiming this year's election.When it comes to issues about human rights, climate change and solving economic inequality, Harris's plentiful progressive priorities are held in high esteem by the Gen Z demographic.\"Her influence now on social media is not like we've seen before. It's a unique approach and is definitely helpful,\" Guzman said.At 59 years young, Harris appeals to UO students as a highly receptive lead for defending the values of tomorrow through her leadership today. Certainly, her social media appeal can only bolster these positive reactions for her campaign.Her personal story of resilience and diversity offers a refreshing, unapologetic narrative that compels a generation to continue the fight for equal representation in the most salient matters of today's political agenda.But, the question remains: can she convert TikTok likes and internet fame into actionable change? I'd say the answer is a resounding \"yes.\" Harris's youthful, bubbly, spirited campaign trail online has active Democratic supporters gushing over the idea of a \"Femininomenon\" era of politics.On X, TikTok and Instagram, her popularity has flourished, cultivating a deeper presence about just how special it is to be a woman in a position of power. Further data from the University of Georgia concludes Harris' suggestive take is outnumbering Trump's Twitter finger days, concluding that her internet fame may take her places further than a few X followers.The iconic neon \"brat\" meme might just give her the green light to a president-elect position, garnering publicity on all platforms as it coincides with all the right moves that the Biden-Harris administration has made surrounding lowered prescription drug costs, veteran healthcare services and modernized infrastructure initiatives.It's to be decided if the stars align in November in the same way they propelled Harris into the Gen Z quick-switch gaze, but we'll stay resharing her image with fellow digital nomads in high hopes.The epic crossover between Madam Vice President and artists such as Charli XCX and Chappell Roan is one for the history books -- and the culture. While her internet campaign continues to reach new heights, it's imperative to understand the raw influence Harris imposes on Gen Z cyber-dwellers, beyond the context of all in which we live.",

The election, featuring Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, presents a unique scenario for the cryptocurrency market.What Happened: Despite the election's proximity, the crypto market remains stable. Bitcoin's price has fluctuated between $55,000 and $65,000 over the past three months, marking a modest 6% increase. This stability follows a spike in July when Trump was shot at a rally, boosting his election prospects, and President Joe Biden subsequently withdrew, endorsing Harris, Barron's reported on Monday.Brett Reeves from BitGo believes Harris's candidacy has balanced the crypto market. Meanwhile, Gregory Benhaim from 3iQ predicts a Trump win could temporarily boost Bitcoin prices, though legislative challenges might arise without a Republican Congress majority. Conversely, Harris's victory could lead to a more volatile market, despite her recent support for crypto as a future industry.See Also: Gary Gensler Doubts Cryptocurrency Future, Says Leading Figures Are Either In Jail Or Awaiting ExtraditionBenhaim views the election as a long-term win for Bitcoin, given neither candidate plans to address the U.S. debt, enhancing Bitcoin's appeal over fiat currency.\"I'm really not looking at this election as a make-or-break moment for Bitcoin or digital assets as a whole,\" he said.Why It Matters: Trump recently announced the launch of a token sale for his decentralized finance project, World Liberty Financial, emphasizing his commitment to the crypto space.Analysts from Bernstein suggest that a Trump victory could propel Bitcoin to new highs, potentially reaching $80,000 to $90,000.

    "content": "This week's Future of Work newsletter examines how leaders can navigate the divisiveness of election season, interviews Indeed's CEO about the job market and dives into news about the workforce.This is the published version of Forbes' Future of Work newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief human resources officers and other talent managers on disruptive technologies, managing the workforce and trends in the remote work debate. Click here to get it delivered to your inbox every Monday!he 2024 presidential election is just 22 days away. And we all know what that means: More divisive conversations in the hallways, questions about rights and privileges when it comes to free speech at work, and yet another reason many workers don't want to come back to the office. An Owl Labs survey of 2,000 full-time U.S. workers found that 45% said their employers' or colleagues' political opinions have made them not want to go to the office.As is common at this point in an election year, we'll hear plenty of advice for how executive leaders can manage the run-up to November 5: from helping employees develop civil discourse skills, to navigating the polarization around DEI and facilitating productive conflict. But one issue has gotten less attention: how to deal with the day after.Depending on the makeup of your workforce, half or more may be unhappy with the election results -- that is, if we have results the following day -- and being in the office around others could present some challenges. Contributor Bryan Robinson suggests employers should honor work-from-home requests that day, giving people space to choose where they'll be able to do their best work.At the very least, we hope everyone is encouraging workers to vote -- and giving them time off to do so. HR Executive cites a survey from workforce data provider Brightmine which found that even though 31 states have policies mandating workers get time off to vote, less than a third of workers say their employer offers voting-leave policies, and only 28% of the 2,000 Americans surveyed have used voting time off to cast a ballot in an election.Boeing said last week it has withdrawn a pay raise offer made to its striking factory workers after negotiations between both sides fell apart, extending a major work stoppage. Stephanie Pope, the president and CEO of Boeing's Commercial Airplanes division, said the plane maker \"bargained in good faith\" and offered \"increases in take-home pay and retirement,\" while the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) -- which represents the 33,000 striking workers -- issued its own statement, saying Boeing was \"hell-bent on standing on the non-negotiated offer.\" Then Friday, the aerospace firm announced it would cut 10% of its workforce in the coming months, or about 17,000 jobs, including executives and managers.Kate Ryder, founder and CEO of women's health startup Maven Clinic, is trying to disrupt the current cost model of infertility care by offering employers a payment platform that charges a flat fee to route women through the journey that's best for them. \"We just charge one fixed fee, which means that we can really sit there with the patient and try to understand what's best for her based on her medical history, her financial situation, and what she wants,\" Ryder told Forbes' Maggie McGrath. Last week, Maven Clinic raised a $125 million Series F round led by StepStone Group at a $1.7 billion valuation. Check out \nFormer President Donald Trump said last week he supports the end of \"double taxation\" for Americans who live overseas, according to multiple outlets, marking his latest tax cut proposal in the leadup to the election. The change to the tax code could specifically unburden higher income Americans with investments who pay taxes for both the U.S. and the place where they reside.Amid the ongoing furor over remote and hybrid work, two surveys show how much employers want people back -- and that employees don't want to follow the mandates. HR Dive published a survey by Robert Half in June finding that two out of three managers said they would be willing to increase salaries for new hires who work in an office. Meanwhile another survey from Resume Builder found that one in five workers say they aren't following their company's mandate, with about half saying they'll quit if their company enforces RTO compliance.Amid softer hiring, AI's impact and surprising news about recent jobs numbers that shattered economists' estimates -- Forbes spoke with Indeed CEO Chris Hyams about what he's seeing in the job market, the platform's evolving business and how AI is changing the experience for recruiters and candidates. Excerpts from our conversation have been edited for length and clarity.As we look ahead to the end of the year, what are you seeing in terms of the number of job postings?It is very clear, thematically, looking at our data, that demand has been softening. Still, macro,  above pre-pandemic. We baseline everything to February of 2020. We are, as of last week, I think about 11 or 12% above pre-pandemic levels across the board. It was still a tight hiring market pre-pandemic.However, it is a tale of multiple sectors here. ... If we look at the peak -- a year and a half, two years ago -- overall, we were about 60% above pre-pandemic levels for the entire U.S. market. So the fact that we're down 11 and 12% above pre-pandemic means we're down considerably.At the same time, quit rates are down. Churn has come down. When we look at labor force participation, that is actually up, which we think is a good thing. ... There are more people coming into the market and they're going directly onto the unemployment rolls. The way we think of it at a high level is the labor market is strong enough to be attracting people back into it, but not strong enough currently to be placing them all.How much of that is economic issues and hiring versus AI?We are looking very carefully trying to see where we can prove AI is having this impact on jobs. We have not yet -- and we have a lot of very smart people looking at this -- seen here is a specific instance of \"this job looks like it is going away.\"It's not 100% perfect, but it's highly correlated that the areas where AI is more likely to have a higher impact -- those job listings are lower than their peak, relatively speaking, to the more in-person . I can't say how much of that is because of boom and bust, or how much of that is the availability of work being able to be done remotely, .However, in my own assessment ... a job opening is a forward looking assessment of what kind of labor I'm going to need in the future. AI does not have to actually replace any jobs for someone to think I might need less  in the future. I suspect what we are starting to see is people thinking I am less likely to need more people as opposed to AI being capable of doing that person's job.How is AI impacting the job search process?Our focus for the platform is we want to ensure that every job has a human being on the other side who is actually responsive and looking at applications as they come in and every person who's applying to jobs is a human being who's actually seen that job.What we're trying to do is use AI on our side to help people find things that are the best fit for them. So instead of going the other direction, applying to 100 jobs a day, you might apply to one or two of exactly the right jobs where you have a pretty good sense that you're a good fit.How is your business changing?We started out really as a search engine and we aggregated all the jobs and people came and they searched but then they clicked and they left and went somewhere else. When we do that, it's actually very hard to control for quality. ... So what we've been doing for much of the last 20 years is moving from being just a pure search engine to a real two sided marketplace. The more people engage on the platform, the more dramatic the results. Part of that is going from a quantity to quality focus.Search used to be the way job seekers found jobs on Indeed. Today, 60% of all of the paid connections that happen on the platform happen through recommendations. So a job seeker will come and search, but the vast majority of the jobs that they're seeing are ones that we are recommending to them.A recent report from Gallup found that even though 93% of Fortune 500 CHROs say their organization has begun using AI tools and technologies to improve business practices, most workers remain unaware of these efforts. The second quarter survey was conducted in May with a random sample of 21,543 working adults who are members of the Gallup Panel.33%: Only a third of all U.S. employees say their organization has begun integrating AI into their business practices, Gallup's survey found, with the highest percentage in white-collar industries (44%). That's lower than other surveys from tech firms like Microsoft, which reported in May that 75% of full-time office workers surveyed said they're now using AI at work.67%: The percentage of employees who said they never use artificial intelligence in their roles, Gallup found in its survey.\"Weekly use remains limited, and many employees never use AI,\" Kate Den Houter wrote in a summary of the survey. \"Despite leaders prioritizing AI adoption and using AI tools themselves, most employees are not.\"Atlassian's president talks about collaborative cultures, AI and CEO transitionsThe best ways leaders can champion employee mental healthGrow your emotional intelligence with these three science-backed strategies.The Secure Act 2.0 allows companies to offer 401(k) contributions to workers who are actively making student loan payments -- even if those employees are not contributing to their retirement accounts themselves.

    "title": "A devastating hurricane doesn't dramatically change how people vote - but in a close election, it can matter",
    "content": "(The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.)Boris Heersink, Fordham University(THE CONVERSATION) North Carolina and Florida are changing administrative rules and, in some cases, issuing emergency funding that is intended to make it easier for people in areas damaged by Hurricanes Helene and Milton to vote.The recovery in both states is expected to extend far beyond the November 2024 election period. The majority of the people in the affected communities in North Carolina and Florida voted for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in 2020, making some election analysts wonder if some Trump supporters will be able to cast their ballots.Amy Lieberman, a politics and society editor at The Conversation U.S., spoke with Boris Heersink, a scholar of voters' behavior after a natural disaster, to better understand if and how the recent hurricanes could shift the results of the 2024 presidential election.How can hurricanes create complications ahead of an election?A massive hurricane disrupts people's lives in many important ways, including affecting people's personal safety and where they can live. Ahead of an election, there are a lot of practical limitations about how an election can be executed - like if a person can still receive mail-in ballots at home or elsewhere, or if it is possible to still vote in person at their polling location if that building was destroyed or damaged.Another issue is whether people who have just lived through a natural disaster and will likely be dealing with the aftermath for weeks to come are focused on politics right now. Some might sit out the election because they simply have more important things to worry about.Beyond practical concerns, how else can a natural disaster influence an election?The other side of the equation, which is what political scientists like myself are mostly focusing on, is whether people take the fact that a natural disaster happened into consideration when they vote.Two scholars, Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels, have argued that sometimes voters are not great at figuring out how to incorporate bad things that happened to them into a voting position. In some cases, it is entirely fair to hold an elected official responsible for bad outcomes that affect people's lives. But at other moments, bad things can happen to us without that being the fault of an incumbent president or governor. And voters should ideally be able to balance out these different types of bad things - those it is fair to punish elected officials for, and those for which it isn't fair to hold them responsible.After all, a devastating hurricane is terrible, but it is not Kamala Harris' fault that it happened. But Achen and Bartels argue that voters frequently still punish elected officials for random bad events like this.Their most famous example is the consequences of a series of shark attacks off the New Jersey coast in the summer of 1916. As a result of those attacks, the New Jersey tourism industry saw a major decline. While these findings are still being debated, Achen and Bartels argue that Jersey shore voters subsequently voted against Woodrow Wilson in the 1916 presidential election at a higher rate than they would have had the shark attacks not happened. They argue that voters did this even though Wilson had no involvement in the shark attacks.How else do voters consider bad events when they vote?Scholars like John Gasper and Andrew Reeves argue that voters mostly care whether elected officials respond appropriately to a disaster. So, if the president does a good job reacting, voters do not actually punish them at all in the next election. However, voters can punish elected officials if they feel like the response is not correct.The fact that Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana in 2005 was not the fault of then-President George W. Bush. But the perceived slowness of the government response is something a voter could have held him responsible for.How do voters' political affiliations affect where and how they lay the blame?Colleagues and I have shown that how people interpret the combination of a disaster and the government response is likely colored by their own partisanship.We looked at both the effects of Superstorm Sandy on the 2012 presidential election and natural disasters' impact on elections more broadly from 1972 through 2004. One core finding is that when presidents reject state officials' disaster declaration requests, they lose votes in affected counties - but only if those counties were already more supportive of the opposite party.If there is a strong positive government response, the incumbent president or their party can actually gain votes or lose voters affected by a disaster. So, Republicans affected by the hurricanes could become more inclined to vote against Harris if they feel like they are not getting the help they need. But it could also help Harris if affected Democrats feel like they are getting enough aid.The major takeaway is that if the government responds really effectively to a natural disaster or other emergency, there is not a huge electoral penalty - and there could even be a small reward.That is not irrelevant in a close election. If Republicans in affected areas in North Carolina feel the government response has been poor and it inspires them to turn out in higher numbers to punish Harris, that could matter. But if they feel like the response has been adequate, research suggests either no real effect on their support for Harris - or possibly even an increase in Harris voters.How much influence can a politician have on people assessing a government response?Scholars mostly assume that people affected can tell whether the government response was good or not. Trump and other Republicans are falsely saying that the response is slow and falsely claiming that Federal Emergency Management Agency money is being spent on immigrants who are not living in the country legally. There does not appear to be a slow government response to the hurricane in North Carolina, and there's no evidence the response is insufficient in Florida, either.So, the question now is whether voters affected by these hurricanes will respond based on their actual lived experiences, or how they are told they are living their experience.This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

    "content": "Known for his iconic portrayal of Walter White, Cranston spoke out while attending a Harris-Walz campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona.Bryan Cranston's support adds to the growing list of Hollywood figures aligning with Kamala Harris as political tensions rise ahead of the 2024 election.In an event titled \"Fighting for Reproductive Freedom,\" Saturday's gathering put the spotlight on abortion rights. The 68-year-old actor took center stage, sharing his thoughts on \"the freedom of choice,\" while emphasizing his personal connection as the father of a daughter.\"I am not a politician. I am not a doctor or a lawyer, but I played all of those on TV. But I am a father of a daughter, and it's important to me for her life now, for the future other father's daughters to be able to have within their lifetime the fundamental right, freedom of choice,\" Cranston said at the event.In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court made a historic decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, effectively upholding a Mississippi law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. This ruling struck down the constitutional protections for abortion rights that had been in place for nearly 50 years.The original 1973 Roe decision had affirmed the constitutional right to access abortion care, making this reversal a significant shift in legal precedent.\"There should not be anyone but them deciding what happens to their own bodies. And that's why I am enthusiastically supporting Vice President Harris and Governor Walz.\"The actor praised Harris's dedication to issues like freedom of choice and reproductive rights, signaling his belief in her vision for America's future.Bryan Cranston had high praise for Kamala Harris, commending her for bringing a sense of optimism back into American politics. He expressed his appreciation for \"Kamala for bringing back optimism and fighting cynicism and animosity in Washington,\" adding that he firmly believes she is the best candidate to lead the country forward.The \"Breaking Bad\" actor went on to say he has no doubt that \"she will be a terrific president,\" voicing his strong support for Harris's leadership potential.Fans' opinions on his endorsement were mixed, with one X user expressing, \"Well, Bryan Cranston, that's disappointing,\" while another praised the actor. \"Smart man ...Bryan Cranston,\" they said.Kamala Harris entered the presidential race with a strong commitment to \"restore reproductive freedom.\" Her campaign clarified that she is specifically advocating for the restoration of Roe v. Wade.According to a statement given to POLITICO, the Harris campaign reaffirmed that her stance, as expressed in a September interview on Face the Nation, remains unchanged -- she continues to support restoring Roe, which protected abortion rights up until the point of fetal viability, typically around 22 weeks of pregnancy.\"I am being precise. We need to put into law the protections of Roe v. Wade,\" Harris said at the time. \"And that is about going back to where we were before the Dobbs decision.\"Bryan Cranston has joined the long list of celebrities who have publicly endorsed Kamala Harris, including Taylor Swift, who announced her presidential pick shortly after the Donald Trump vs Kamala Harris debate last month.\"I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election,\" the \"Love Story\" singer announced. \"I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.\"\"Newsies\" star Jeremy Jordan, \"The Little Mermaid\" actress Halle Bailey, former NBA star Magic Johnson, and \"Road House\" star Sam Elliot have also publicly endorsed Kamala Harris.",

    "title": "A devastating hurricane doesn't dramatically change how people vote - but in a close election, it can matter",
    "content": "(The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.)The recovery in both states is expected to extend far beyond the November 2024 election period. The majority of the people in the affected communities in North Carolina and Florida voted for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in 2020, making some election analysts wonder if some Trump supporters will be able to cast their ballots.Amy Lieberman, a politics and society editor at The Conversation U.S., spoke with Boris Heersink, a scholar of voters' behavior after a natural disaster, to better understand if and how the recent hurricanes could shift the results of the 2024 presidential election.How can hurricanes create complications ahead of an election?A massive hurricane disrupts people's lives in many important ways, including affecting people's personal safety and where they can live. Ahead of an election, there are a lot of practical limitations about how an election can be executed - like if a person can still receive mail-in ballots at home or elsewhere, or if it is possible to still vote in person at their polling location if that building was destroyed or damaged.Another issue is whether people who have just lived through a natural disaster and will likely be dealing with the aftermath for weeks to come are focused on politics right now. Some might sit out the election because they simply have more important things to worry about.Beyond practical concerns, how else can a natural disaster influence an election?The other side of the equation, which is what political scientists like myself are mostly focusing on, is whether people take the fact that a natural disaster happened into consideration when they vote.Two scholars, Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels, have argued that sometimes voters are not great at figuring out how to incorporate bad things that happened to them into a voting position. In some cases, it is entirely fair to hold an elected official responsible for bad outcomes that affect people's lives. But at other moments, bad things can happen to us without that being the fault of an incumbent president or governor. And voters should ideally be able to balance out these different types of bad things - those it is fair to punish elected officials for, and those for which it isn't fair to hold them responsible.After all, a devastating hurricane is terrible, but it is not Kamala Harris' fault that it happened. But Achen and Bartels argue that voters frequently still punish elected officials for random bad events like this.Their most famous example is the consequences of a series of shark attacks off the New Jersey coast in the summer of 1916. As a result of those attacks, the New Jersey tourism industry saw a major decline. While these findings are still being debated, Achen and Bartels argue that Jersey shore voters subsequently voted against Woodrow Wilson in the 1916 presidential election at a higher rate than they would have had the shark attacks not happened. They argue that voters did this even though Wilson had no involvement in the shark attacks.How else do voters consider bad events when they vote?Scholars like John Gasper and Andrew Reeves argue that voters mostly care whether elected officials respond appropriately to a disaster. So, if the president does a good job reacting, voters do not actually punish them at all in the next election. However, voters can punish elected officials if they feel like the response is not correct.The fact that Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana in 2005 was not the fault of then-President George W. Bush. But the perceived slowness of the government response is something a voter could have held him responsible for.How do voters' political affiliations affect where and how they lay the blame?Colleagues and I have shown that how people interpret the combination of a disaster and the government response is likely colored by their own partisanship.We looked at both the effects of Superstorm Sandy on the 2012 presidential election and natural disasters' impact on elections more broadly from 1972 through 2004. One core finding is that when presidents reject state officials' disaster declaration requests, they lose votes in affected counties - but only if those counties were already more supportive of the opposite party.If there is a strong positive government response, the incumbent president or their party can actually gain votes or lose voters affected by a disaster. So, Republicans affected by the hurricanes could become more inclined to vote against Harris if they feel like they are not getting the help they need. But it could also help Harris if affected Democrats feel like they are getting enough aid.The major takeaway is that if the government responds really effectively to a natural disaster or other emergency, there is not a huge electoral penalty - and there could even be a small reward.That is not irrelevant in a close election. If Republicans in affected areas in North Carolina feel the government response has been poor and it inspires them to turn out in higher numbers to punish Harris, that could matter. But if they feel like the response has been adequate, research suggests either no real effect on their support for Harris - or possibly even an increase in Harris voters.How much influence can a politician have on people assessing a government response?Scholars mostly assume that people affected can tell whether the government response was good or not. Trump and other Republicans are falsely saying that the response is slow and falsely claiming that Federal Emergency Management Agency money is being spent on immigrants who are not living in the country legally. There does not appear to be a slow government response to the hurricane in North Carolina, and there's no evidence the response is insufficient in Florida, either.So, the question now is whether voters affected by these hurricanes will respond based on their actual lived experiences, or how they are told they are living their experience.This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

    "content": "DANA BASH, CNN: Congressman, before I let you go, I do want to ask about a law that Congress passed, a new version of the Electoral Count Act. They passed it two years ago, and it makes it harder to object to certifying election results on January 6, 2025 and beyond.Some Trump allies have argued that's unconstitutional. The House speaker hasn't taken a clear position. Should Congress follow that law in certifying the 2024 presidential election?REP. BYRON DONALDS: Look, I think, when you're talking about the election this November, the thing people want is that local jurisdictions follow the law passed by the states.As long as everybody does that, there's not going to be any problem certifying this election this November. But what really matters about this election are the issues facing the American people, not the Electoral College Count Act, because what we need is a president who's going to secure our border, actually make our foreign policy be strong again and make sense again. That's what matters.BASH: Right. But my question is, are you going to follow the new law? Are you going to follow the new law about certifying the election?DONALDS: As long -- and I have been very clear, Dana. As long as states and jurisdictions follow election procedures in their states, there will be no problem for me or anybody on Capitol Hill.BASH: All right, well, that's a giant loophole that you're leaving there, which -- there's no evidence that that has not happened. It didn't happen in 2020.DONALDS: That's not a loophole. That's actually not a loophole, Dana, and if you look at what happened in Pennsylvania, Arizona, and other jurisdictions...BASH: There's absolutely -- Congressman...DONALDS: ... in 2020, they did not follow election procedures passed by the state legislature. That's an empirical fact.BASH: There is no evidence of widespread fraud. That went through, what, 60 court cases, and even Bill Barr, the former president...DONALDS: Dana, I did not say fraud. You said fraud.What I'm talking about -- and if you want to talk about it, let's be clear. You had the state of Pennsylvania, where the state Supreme Court said they would count ballots three days after the polls closed in Pennsylvania in 2020. That's a violation of state law passed by the legislature, signed by the governor. That's what happened in the state of Pennsylvania. That's one example.",

    "content": "By Katelyn Caralle, senior US political reporter in Washington, DCKamala Harris is facing the wrath of TIME's owner after she refused to participate in an interview with the renowned news magazine.The vice president has declined to participate in an interview with several traditional media outlets since taking over Joe Biden's campaign and leading the 2024 Democratic presidential ticket, and has faced widespread criticism for her sparse media strategy.Marc Benioff wrote about his disappointment with X, claiming that Time Magazine had reached out several times for an interview with the presidential candidate.\"Despite multiple requests, TIME has not been granted an interview with Kamala Harris - unlike every other presidential candidate,\" the owner wrote on Sunday.Benioff included a link to interviews Time Magazine conducted with former President Donald Trump and President Biden when he was still running for re-election in 2024.Time owner Marc Benioff (pictured) is furious that Vice President Kamala Harris has rejected repeated requests from the magazine to appear for an interview before the 2024 presidential electionYour browser does not support iframes.\"We believe in transparency and publish every interview in full,\" he added. \"Why doesn't the vice president interact with the public on the same level?\"The charges against Harris' refusal to interview with the magazine come as CBS News faces intense backlash for positively editing the candidate's 60 Minutes interview.A Time article published on October 10 titled What Kind of President Would Kamala Harris Be? notes that the vice president has \"declined repeated requests for an interview for this story.\"Trump, on the other hand, spoke about his policy vision for 90 minutes with a TIME reporter in two interviews. Biden spoke to TIME for a while before dropping out of the race,\" they added in that article.Critics, especially pro-MAGA social media accounts, have questioned Harris' media strategy ahead of the election.There are only 22 days until the election next month and Harris has not yet made the full push on media appearances as most candidates do in the run-up to Election Day.VP Harris's media strategy has been questioned by critics after she rejected a number of mainstream and traditional media outlets in favor of more alternative media, such as the raunchy, sex-oriented podcast Call Her Daddy.The VP has conducted some questionable interviews, such as with the raunchy and sex-oriented podcast Call Her Daddy.

    "title": "The California community caught between a powerful megachurch and far-right extremists",
    "content": "This is the third in a series of three stories on the run-up to the 2024 US presidential election in Shasta county, a region of 180,000 people in northern California that has emerged as a center of the election denial movement and hotbed for far-right politics. Read the first and second story.For years, an extremist far-right movement has worked to transform one of California's most conservative regions. Since gaining a majority on Shasta county's governing body, they have managed to spark an exodus of government workers, attempted to do away with the voting system and fought the state over policies pertaining to Covid-19 and the second amendment.Earlier this year, voters in the community of 180,000 - perhaps tired of Shasta's national notoriety as a hotbed for extremist politics and election denialism - declared they had had enough. In a stunning rebuke, they voted out a far-right leader by an enormous margin, handing his seat to a political newcomer.Matt Plummer, a Yale-educated former college football player who owns a corporate training business, pledged to provide an alternative to the \"hostility and division\" tearing Shasta apart. Supporters view Plummer, with his focus on issues such as crime, roads and homelessness, as someone who can help the community chart a path out of the upheaval.But others are concerned about Plummer's connection to another powerful and ultra-conservative force that has reshaped the region: Bethel church. The megachurch has more than 11,000 members, including Plummer, and a school of \"supernatural ministry\" that serves 2,000 students a year.Bethel leaders once said that God wanted Donald Trump to have a second term and have claimed that Joe Biden won the 2020 election by \"fraud\". Church members have become major players in local government - three of the five members on the city council in Redding, the county seat, attend Bethel. The city's vice-mayor is a church elder.The church is involved in nearly every part of Shasta county, and is a cornerstone of the local economy, said Doni Chamberlain, a longtime local journalist and chronicler of the area.Shasta's extreme political landscape has forced residents to choose between a toxic rightwing movement and a church that also has deeply conservative and extreme beliefs, she said.\"This is the bind we're in,\" she said. \"Shasta county is in this weird extremist sandwich where we have the rightwing pushing for guns and splitting the state. And there is the other extreme side of the sandwich that is Bethel church. Then the middle where people are trying to figure out how to survive in this place.\"***Before Shasta county garnered national attention for its fierce opposition to Covid-19 restrictions and efforts to institute a hand-count voting system favored by those who believe lies about election fraud, it was Bethel church that raised the region's profile.There are churches - of which Shasta county has plenty - and then there is Bethel, a behemoth institution without parallel in the area. First established in a private home in 1952, it now has more than 11,000 members - more than 10% of the population in the city of Redding - where the church is based.Bethel's transformation came under the direction of Bill Johnson, the son of a long-serving pastor who began leading the church with Beni, his wife, in 1996. The church has grown significantly, opening a school, a youth outreach program and Bethel Music, a record label that produces popular worship music and reported $18m in revenue in 2023. Justin Bieber is a fan and has filmed himself covering a song from a Bethel artist. Today several of Johnson's children work as senior leaders in the church.But it's Bethel's school of supernatural ministry, which has been called a \"Christian Hogwarts\", that is often credited with its growth. The program was founded by Kris and Kathy Vallotton, the senior leaders of the church, and teaches students that they can perform miracles and heal through prayer. \"Students will learn how to read, understand, and 'do' the Bible, how to practice His presence, to witness, heal the sick, prophesy, preach, pray, cast out demons and much more,\" the school website states.Related: How an ultra-right majority in California's far north picked a novice to run its electionsPeople travel to Redding from around the world, more than 100 countries, to attend the vocational program. Students have been known to approach people in the city, particularly those in casts or with walkers, to offer prayers for healing. The focus on \"supernatural power\" is fundamental to the church, which in 2019 asked members to pray for the resurrection of a two-year-old girl.Bethel has long believed in the power of healing people through prayer. Chamberlain joined the church as a child after her mother died and her siblings were adopted by a local couple who were members. When they learned that Chamberlain and her twin sister had a neurological disorder that caused involuntary movements, church elders came to treat their \"demons\" and the children were made to throw away their medications, Chamberlain recalled.\"When you have a bunch of adults circling around you and putting their hands on your heads and shaking you, it was pretty intimidating,\" she said, adding that they coached her on how to speak in tongues.\"It's like being waterboarded, you just give up and give in so they leave you alone. Then you're in the club.\"Since its founding in 1998, Bethel's supernatural school has brought thousands of people to Redding. They are a visible presence around the city, in its grocery stores and the hip cafes and bakeries operated by Bethel members. And as the church's footprint has grown, so too has criticism of its role.Supporters say the church has been a positive force in Redding and that it's natural for a large institution to attract scrutiny but that members want to be a part of the community in which they live. They often point to local volunteer work or when the church donated money to fund police positions in Redding and began leasing the local auditorium when it appeared the city would have to close it down.Bethel did not respond to multiple requests for comment.But other Shasta county residents argue the church has changed the fabric of the community and worsened an existing housing shortage by drawing thousands of students to the area while driving up costs.\"If you look from the outside in, there seems to be positives. They've done good things, but I don't feel like on balance what they've done is for the good of the community in general,\" said Robert Sid, a Shasta county resident who supported Plummer. \"Their Hogwarts supernatural ministry has really played into flooding the market and artificially pricing things that the regular Redding person can't afford.\"Critics have expressed discomfort with church members who hold key positions in local government voting on proposals from Bethel to expand. Some residents have joined a Facebook group to identify businesses connected to the church.\" tithe to the church. If you patronize a Bethel-affiliated business then now some of those profits are being tithed to the church. You're kind of indirectly supporting the church by doing that,\" said Rachel Strickland, who started the group. \"People don't want to do that.\"And for some in this deeply conservative region, where Republicans outnumber Democrats two to one, the church's political ties have been cause for concern as well. Religious experts have described it as closely related to the New Apostolic Reformation, a movement built around the idea of modern-day prophets and apostles that aims to have Christians transform society and rule over key political and cultural institutions, referred to as the \"Seven Mountain Mandate\".Johnson co-authored a book, Invading Babylon: the 7 Mountain Mandate, which advises Christians to exert influence in seven core areas: church, family, education, government, media, arts and commerce.Matthew D Taylor, a senior scholar at the Institute for Islamic, Christian and Jewish studies who has studied Bethel, argued that the church appears to be trying to implement the Seven Mountain Mandate in its community.Related: Extremist politics divided this conservative California community. What will it take to turn the tide?\"I think they very much intend to enact this bigger vision of Christian supremacy and Christian dominance in the Redding area. It doesn't mean they are always overt about that,\" said Taylor, the author of a book on the New Apostolic Reformation for which he interviewed Johnson.Bethel leaders endorsed Donald Trump, and in 2021 one apologized for incorrectly prophesying that he would win a second term. The church has come out against efforts to restrict conversion therapy. In 2019, several figures associated with the church attended an Oval Office event with Trump to pray over the president. Bethel has sought to distance itself from January 6, however, Taylor said.\"They are trying to tone down public rhetoric and make themselves  less extreme than they are but as far as I can tell they haven't moderated their extremism. They are just trying to package it in a better way,\" he argued.The church has long emphasized that the beliefs of individual church members are not necessarily reflective of the church's positions. Chamberlain, who left the church as a young adult, argues it is important to distinguish between the church leadership and its members.\"You have to separate the leaders of the church, the people who are millionaires and drive expensive cars, cars that cost as much as somebody might pay for a house. They have vacation homes and eat at The French Laundry,\" Chamberlain said.They live a life of the rich and famous, she added, while some Bethel members, and students, leave their homes abroad and live in extreme poverty to be close to the church.Members point out that they are not a monolith.Matt Plummer's journey to Redding began the same way thousands of others have - with Bethel. He moved to the city in 2016 with his wife and daughters to attend the church, and remains a member, he said in an interview with the Guardian.Plummer, who grew up in rural New Jersey where his first job was on a horse farm, was drawn to the region's access to nature from hiking to swimming holes, he said, and the family has developed deep ties to the area.He decided to run for the board of supervisors after working in several political campaigns and seeing the intense polarization and problems that have plagued Shasta county.\"We have tied basically for the highest suicide rate in the state. You have one of the highest rates of childhood trauma and one of the highest rates of kids being born with drug withdrawal effects,\" he said. \"This is a pretty cool community that has a lot to offer but at the same time if you look at all these dimensions of what makes a community thrive, we're trailing.\"He had a tough race ahead of him seeking to unseat Patrick Jones, who previously served on the Redding city council and had been a supervisor for three years as well as a leader of the anti-establishment movement that has come to define local politics.Jones, a gun store manager, led some of the county's most controversial efforts, including attempting to upend the voting system and moving to allow people to carry firearms in public buildings in violation of state law. He also spread conspiracy theories, telling a conservative national news outlet: \"Elections have been manipulated at the county level for decades.\"He once responded to a reporter's query by telling them to \"drop dead\".While polarizing, Jones was well-known and had been in politics for years, Plummer said, and had the backing of a Connecticut magnate who has poured millions of dollars into local elections.Plummer made up for that by making personal contact, and personally knocked on about 9,000 doors, he said (there are about 23,000 registered voters in his district).\"People care if you show up and meet them,\" he said.He sought to stay out of ideological debates and focus on what residents were worried about, primarily public safety, roads and homelessness. The number of unhoused residents has grown significantly in recent years from 793 in 2022 to 1,013 people in 2023.\"My opponent had been on the board almost four years and he had been on city council for eight years, which had some jurisdiction over the same things. And they had all gotten worse,\" he said.His affiliation with Bethel was a concern, he acknowledged, one he tried to address and alleviate. \"I'm not speaking on stage and not this type of celebrity at Bethel. I just go there on a Sunday morning.\"\"One of the things I said is: 'I'm not running to represent Bethel and so my job is not to defend Bethel' and so when people would attack Bethel for things, I'd say OK, that's fine. That's actually not my priority here,\" he said.Strickland, who has described Bethel as a cult, said the choice put the community in a tough position, but that even in her Facebook group people seemed to be leaning toward Plummer. \"For me Patrick Jones is much more dangerous.\"Plummer received the endorsement of Chamberlain's publication, A News Cafe, drawing backlash from some readers who started referring to the outlet as Bethel Cafe.\"It was a tough call. I have a problem with Bethel on a lot of levels, but just kind of putting on your thinking cap sometimes the Bethel candidates were the best choice for the positions,\" she said.\"Do we vote for Patrick Jones who is pushing guns and open carry? Or do we vote for Matt Plummer who is a Bethel member? He's also articulate, educated and smart.\"And in the current political climate in the county, Chamberlain mused, few people would want to subject themselves to running for office. \"The Bethel people are kind of impervious to it. It's scriptural.\"",

    "title": "The California community caught between a powerful megachurch and far-right extremists",
    "content": "Shasta residents voted out an anti-establishment leader in favor of a business owner who attends the enormously popular yet controversial Bethel churchThis is the third in a series of three stories on the run-up to the 2024 US presidential election in Shasta county, a region of 180,000 people in northern California that has emerged as a center of the election denial movement and hotbed for far-right politics. Read the first and second story.For years, an extremist far-right movement has worked to transform one of California's most conservative regions. Since gaining a majority on Shasta county's governing body, they have managed to spark an exodus of government workers, attempted to do away with the voting system and fought the state over policies pertaining to Covid-19 and the second amendment.Earlier this year, voters in the community of 180,000 - perhaps tired of Shasta's national notoriety as a hotbed for extremist politics and election denialism - declared they had had enough. In a stunning rebuke, they voted out a far-right leader by an enormous margin, handing his seat to a political newcomer.Matt Plummer, a Yale-educated former college football player who owns a corporate training business, pledged to provide an alternative to the \"hostility and division\" tearing Shasta apart. Supporters view Plummer, with his focus on issues such as crime, roads and homelessness, as someone who can help the community chart a path out of the upheaval.But others are concerned about Plummer's connection to another powerful and ultra-conservative force that has reshaped the region: Bethel church. The megachurch has more than 11,000 members, including Plummer, and a school of \"supernatural ministry\" that serves 2,000 students a year.Bethel leaders once said that God wanted Donald Trump to have a second term and have claimed that Joe Biden won the 2020 election by \"fraud\". Church members have become major players in local government - three of the five members on the city council in Redding, the county seat, attend Bethel. The city's vice-mayor is a church elder.The church is involved in nearly every part of Shasta county, and is a cornerstone of the local economy, said Doni Chamberlain, a longtime local journalist and chronicler of the area.Shasta's extreme political landscape has forced residents to choose between a toxic rightwing movement and a church that also has deeply conservative and extreme beliefs, she said.\"This is the bind we're in,\" she said. \"Shasta county is in this weird extremist sandwich where we have the rightwing pushing for guns and splitting the state. And there is the other extreme side of the sandwich that is Bethel church. Then the middle where people are trying to figure out how to survive in this place.\"Before Shasta county garnered national attention for its fierce opposition to Covid-19 restrictions and efforts to institute a hand-count voting system favored by those who believe lies about election fraud, it was Bethel church that raised the region's profile.There are churches - of which Shasta county has plenty - and then there is Bethel, a behemoth institution without parallel in the area. First established in a private home in 1952, it now has more than 11,000 members - more than 10% of the population in the city of Redding - where the church is based.Bethel's transformation came under the direction of Bill Johnson, the son of a long-serving pastor who began leading the church with Beni, his wife, in 1996. The church has grown significantly, opening a school, a youth outreach program and Bethel Music, a record label that produces popular worship music and reported $18m in revenue in 2023. Justin Bieber is a fan and has filmed himself covering a song from a Bethel artist. Today several of Johnson's children work as senior leaders in the church.But it's Bethel's school of supernatural ministry, which has been called a \"Christian Hogwarts\", that is often credited with its growth. The program was founded by Kris and Kathy Vallotton, the senior leaders of the church, and teaches students that they can perform miracles and heal through prayer. \"Students will learn how to read, understand, and 'do' the Bible, how to practice His presence, to witness, heal the sick, prophesy, preach, pray, cast out demons and much more,\" the school website states.People travel to Redding from around the world, more than 100 countries, to attend the vocational program. Students have been known to approach people in the city, particularly those in casts or with walkers, to offer prayers for healing. The focus on \"supernatural power\" is fundamental to the church, which in 2019 asked members to pray for the resurrection of a two-year-old girl.Bethel has long believed in the power of healing people through prayer. Chamberlain joined the church as a child after her mother died and her siblings were adopted by a local couple who were members. When they learned that Chamberlain and her twin sister had a neurological disorder that caused involuntary movements, church elders came to treat their \"demons\" and the children were made to throw away their medications, Chamberlain recalled.\"When you have a bunch of adults circling around you and putting their hands on your heads and shaking you, it was pretty intimidating,\" she said, adding that they coached her on how to speak in tongues.\"It's like being waterboarded, you just give up and give in so they leave you alone. Then you're in the club.\"Since its founding in 1998, Bethel's supernatural school has brought thousands of people to Redding. They are a visible presence around the city, in its grocery stores and the hip cafes and bakeries operated by Bethel members. And as the church's footprint has grown, so too has criticism of its role.Supporters say the church has been a positive force in Redding and that it's natural for a large institution to attract scrutiny but that members want to be a part of the community in which they live. They often point to local volunteer work or when the church donated money to fund police positions in Redding and began leasing the local auditorium when it appeared the city would have to close it down.Bethel did not respond to multiple requests for comment.But other Shasta county residents argue the church has changed the fabric of the community and worsened an existing housing shortage by drawing thousands of students to the area while driving up costs.\"If you look from the outside in, there seems to be positives. They've done good things, but I don't feel like on balance what they've done is for the good of the community in general,\" said Robert Sid, a Shasta county resident who supported Plummer. \"Their Hogwarts supernatural ministry has really played into flooding the market and artificially pricing things that the regular Redding person can't afford.\"Critics have expressed discomfort with church members who hold key positions in local government voting on proposals from Bethel to expand. Some residents have joined a Facebook group to identify businesses connected to the church.\" tithe to the church. If you patronize a Bethel-affiliated business then now some of those profits are being tithed to the church. You're kind of indirectly supporting the church by doing that,\" said Rachel Strickland, who started the group. \"People don't want to do that.\"And for some in this deeply conservative region, where Republicans outnumber Democrats two to one, the church's political ties have been cause for concern as well. Religious experts have described it as closely related to the New Apostolic Reformation, a movement built around the idea of modern-day prophets and apostles that aims to have Christians transform society and rule over key political and cultural institutions, referred to as the \"Seven Mountain Mandate\".Johnson co-authored a book, Invading Babylon: the 7 Mountain Mandate, which advises Christians to exert influence in seven core areas: church, family, education, government, media, arts and commerce.Matthew D Taylor, a senior scholar at the Institute for Islamic, Christian and Jewish studies who has studied Bethel, argued that the church appears to be trying to implement the Seven Mountain Mandate in its community.\"I think they very much intend to enact this bigger vision of Christian supremacy and Christian dominance in the Redding area. It doesn't mean they are always overt about that,\" said Taylor, the author of a book on the New Apostolic Reformation for which he interviewed Johnson.Bethel leaders endorsed Donald Trump, and in 2021 one apologized for incorrectly prophesying that he would win a second term. The church has come out against efforts to restrict conversion therapy. In 2019, several figures associated with the church attended an Oval Office event with Trump to pray over the president. Bethel has sought to distance itself from January 6, however, Taylor said.\"They are trying to tone down public rhetoric and make themselves  less extreme than they are but as far as I can tell they haven't moderated their extremism. They are just trying to package it in a better way,\" he argued.The church has long emphasized that the beliefs of individual church members are not necessarily reflective of the church's positions. Chamberlain, who left the church as a young adult, argues it is important to distinguish between the church leadership and its members.\"You have to separate the leaders of the church, the people who are millionaires and drive expensive cars, cars that cost as much as somebody might pay for a house. They have vacation homes and eat at The French Laundry,\" Chamberlain said.They live a life of the rich and famous, she added, while some Bethel members, and students, leave their homes abroad and live in extreme poverty to be close to the church.Members point out that they are not a monolith.Matt Plummer's journey to Redding began the same way thousands of others have - with Bethel. He moved to the city in 2016 with his wife and daughters to attend the church, and remains a member, he said in an interview with the Guardian.Plummer, who grew up in rural New Jersey where his first job was on a horse farm, was drawn to the region's access to nature from hiking to swimming holes, he said, and the family has developed deep ties to the area.He decided to run for the board of supervisors after working in several political campaigns and seeing the intense polarization and problems that have plagued Shasta county.\"We have tied basically for the highest suicide rate in the state. You have one of the highest rates of childhood trauma and one of the highest rates of kids being born with drug withdrawal effects,\" he said. \"This is a pretty cool community that has a lot to offer but at the same time if you look at all these dimensions of what makes a community thrive, we're trailing.\"He had a tough race ahead of him seeking to unseat Patrick Jones, who previously served on the Redding city council and had been a supervisor for three years as well as a leader of the anti-establishment movement that has come to define local politics.Jones, a gun store manager, led some of the county's most controversial efforts, including attempting to upend the voting system and moving to allow people to carry firearms in public buildings in violation of state law. He also spread conspiracy theories, telling a conservative national news outlet: \"Elections have been manipulated at the county level for decades.\"He once responded to a reporter's query by telling them to \"drop dead\".While polarizing, Jones was well-known and had been in politics for years, Plummer said, and had the backing of a Connecticut magnate who has poured millions of dollars into local elections.Plummer made up for that by making personal contact, and personally knocked on about 9,000 doors, he said (there are about 23,000 registered voters in his district).\"People care if you show up and meet them,\" he said.He sought to stay out of ideological debates and focus on what residents were worried about, primarily public safety, roads and homelessness. The number of unhoused residents has grown significantly in recent years from 793 in 2022 to 1,013 people in 2023.\"My opponent had been on the board almost four years and he had been on city council for eight years, which had some jurisdiction over the same things. And they had all gotten worse,\" he said.His affiliation with Bethel was a concern, he acknowledged, one he tried to address and alleviate. \"I'm not speaking on stage and not this type of celebrity at Bethel. I just go there on a Sunday morning.\"\"One of the things I said is: 'I'm not running to represent Bethel and so my job is not to defend Bethel' and so when people would attack Bethel for things, I'd say OK, that's fine. That's actually not my priority here,\" he said.Strickland, who has described Bethel as a cult, said the choice put the community in a tough position, but that even in her Facebook group people seemed to be leaning toward Plummer. \"For me Patrick Jones is much more dangerous.\"Plummer received the endorsement of Chamberlain's publication, A News Cafe, drawing backlash from some readers who started referring to the outlet as Bethel Cafe.\"It was a tough call. I have a problem with Bethel on a lot of levels, but just kind of putting on your thinking cap sometimes the Bethel candidates were the best choice for the positions,\" she said.\"Do we vote for Patrick Jones who is pushing guns and open carry? Or do we vote for Matt Plummer who is a Bethel member? He's also articulate, educated and smart.\"And in the current political climate in the county, Chamberlain mused, few people would want to subject themselves to running for office. \"The Bethel people are kind of impervious to it. It's scriptural.\"",

    "title": "2024 U.S. Presidential Election: A Difficult Choice on Election Day, a Tougher Test for Democracy the Day After",
    "content": "As early voting has begun in several states in the United States, the Uncommitted National Movement (UNM) announced, on September 19th, in a press conference and a statement published on social media that it would not support Kamala Harris' campaign, the Democratic Party presidential candidate.This position comes in the context of an election marked by significant uncertainties and polarization due to the U.S. administration's unconditional support for Israel's non-proportional war on Gaza, Palestine since October 7, 2023, on the one hand, and the presence of the former President Donald Trump--known for his authoritarian tendencies as well as populist and racist rhetoric--as the Republican Party presidential candidate nominee, on the other hand.The UNM made this announcement after Harris failed to respond to its demands that call for:The movement also stressed the importance of not voting for the Republican candidate Donald Trump due to his dangerous pro-war stance on Gaza. It also advised against voting for a third party, which could contribute to Trump's victory.Through this statement, the movement also asserted its commitment to pressuring the U.S. administration to achieve its demands. This position presents a significant challenge to the Democratic Party and triggers many questions about its impact on the political landscape on Election Day and beyond, especially in the event of Trump's win.The UNM was launched in February of this year by activists within the Democratic Party.The movement initiated a protest campaign to urge the US administration to halt Israel's war on Gaza following the events of October 7, 2023.To this end, and in preparation for the Democratic Party's presidential primaries, the movement organized, and in a very short period, an unexpectedly successful campaign in the state of Michigan.The campaign mobilized voters to choose \"Uncommitted\" instead of \"Joe Biden\" on the ballot as a form of pressure to demonstrate to the Democratic Party the weight of votes calling for an end to the war on Gaza.Following this initial success, the movement led other campaigns that achieved remarkable results in states such as Wisconsin, Washington, Minnesota, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Mexico, Oregon, and Hawaii. As a result of this mobilization, the campaign garnered more than 700,000 votes nationwide and secured 37 delegates at the Democratic National Convention.The importance of the campaign lies in the fact that in most of these states, the percentage of votes as \"Uncommitted\" exceeds the margin by which Trump won the 2020 election. Notably, the uncommitted votes were not limited to American Muslims and Arabs; the majority came from other ethnic and social groups within American society, particularly among whites, African Americans, and Latinos.The position of the Uncommitted Movement represents a significant loss for the Democratic Party that can cost it the upcoming presidential election on November 5th. This is especially true given that the movement consists of a substantial \"voting bloc\" that many election experts believe could be decisive on election day, particularly in swing states since the race for the White House between the Republican and Democratic parties is extremely close. For example, Muslim voters within the movement are among the most politically engaged religious groups in the U.S. and they often vote based on key issues and not party affiliation. According to a poll and report published on September, 18 of this year by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU), in the 2020 election, Biden narrowly beat Trump (46% to 45%) in three swing states: Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Georgia. This suggests that the strong support Biden received from Muslim voters was crucial for his victory. The situation appears to be similarly tight in the current election as most ongoing polls in the U.S. indicate a close race between the Democratic and Republican campaigns. As a result, swing states are very likely expected to determine the outcome as both candidates have equal chances of winning. Although it is unlikely that these voters will shift their support to Trump. The same ISPU poll shows that the level of Muslim support for Trump is still about the same since 2016, particularly in swing states. Even in case these voters decide to abstain from voting or support a third party--as a protest vote--this could indirectly benefit Trump.For instance, votes for Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, whose campaign has gained noticeable support, especially among Arab and Muslim American voters, could provide an advantage to Trump. Experts explain that in a closely contested two-party election, the presence of a third party often benefits one of the main candidates. This dynamic poses a serious challenge for the Democratic Party as it risks losing critical votes in key swing states.The position of the current US administration on the war in Gaza certainly presents a difficult choice and challenge for many Democratic Party voters and supporters as well as undecided voters within the general electorate due to their dissatisfaction with both parties, especially among youth.At the same time, many indicators also suggest that the period following the November 5th election will also be a difficult one as the U.S. democratic system and institutions will face greater challenges than those experienced during Trump's presidency between 2016 and 2020.In this context, many political analysts-- such as Professor Jack Goldstone, an expert in social movements and revolutions who raised alarms in 2020 of the possibility of events similar to January 6, 2021, when Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol to stop the certification of the election results to prevent the inauguration of Joe Biden as new President--warn that there is a high likelihood that the U.S. could face significant chaos that can escalate to a civil war.Among the significant indicators of such a possibility are: continued attempts to undermine the democratic process and state institutions, sharp polarization within American society, increasing level of political violence rhetoric, and weakening trust between citizens, state institutions, and political actors.Continued Attempts to Undermine the Democratic Process and Institutions are still key features of Trump's rhetoric. Trump has consistently reminded his supporters that \"We will win, and we won't lose the election; and if we do, it's because of a rigged system and because the Democrats will rig the elections just like they did in 2020 that I won.\" This narrative suggests that, in the event of a loss, Trump is willing to challenge the democratic outcome of the elections and undermine the rule of law, just as he attempted to do in 2021. Most importantly, many analysts point out that Trump seems to be more organized and ready to act with the backing of far-right groups.Given Trump's authoritarian tendencies, many observers do not rule out the possibility of a coup attempt. While this may not involve military force, it could take other forms that obstruct the functioning of constitutional institutions and the enforcement of the law, throwing the country into chaos similar to what he did in 2021 when he incited the attack on the US Capitol. The concern is that if Trump fails to win the election, he and his supporters might engage in disruptive actions that would challenge the democratic norms, leading to widespread disorder and causing political instability in the U.S.In the event of a Trump victory in the 2024 election, the situation may not be much different. Trump will feel more empowered to consolidate authoritarian power that would lead the country into further chaos by undermining democratic institutions and the rule of law. It won't be surprising if Trump issues hasty populist executive orders that erode the principles of diversity and inclusion in the country. For example, he may first target immigrants, just as he did in 2017 with the \"Muslim Ban.\" Similarly, he could issue an executive order to ban abortion. These would be symbolic acts to show his supporters that he is delivering on his campaign promises and urge them to continue supporting him in all his decisions.In the next phase, Trump will continue to use the executive constitutional powers to undermine the institutions that uphold the democratic system in the U.S.He is also expected to rely on the support of Republican lawmakers, especially if the party holds a majority in one or both chambers in Congress, taking into consideration that Trump currently has near-complete control over the Republican Party and a far-right faction that is loyal to him is driving the party's agenda in Congress.This could lead to the enactment of disruptive laws and decisions that would cause widespread institutional dysfunction, possibly paralyzing key functions of the government. A similar scenario occurred during his previous term with the infamous \"Government Shutdown\" in 2018 which lasted 35 days due to a deadlock between Trump and Congress over the federal budget justifying it as a fight against the so-called \"deep state.\" As a result, more than 800,000 federal employees lost their paychecks, and government services were severely disrupted, both domestically and internationally. Trump's presidency is also expected to continue with his isolationist foreign policies.This might include further withdrawals from international agreements and organizations similar to what he did in his first term when he withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement, the United Nations Human Rights Council, the World Health Organization, and The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). All acts would further weaken the U.S. leadership stance on the international stage and strain its relationships with its traditional allies.In this respect, it is worth mentioning the so-called \"Project 2025,\" also known as the \"2025 Presidential Transition Project,\" a political initiative published by the conservative Heritage Foundation in 2023.Its goal is to promote conservative and right-wing policies aimed at reshaping the U.S. federal government and strengthening the executive power should Trump win the 2024 presidential election. Although Trump denies any direct knowledge or involvement with the project, its measures align with his rhetoric and promises.Furthermore, numerous reports and leaks suggest that several key figures associated with it are among Trump's strongest allies and supporters. Many political analysts believe that project has been prepared to be adopted by Trump on the first day of his presidency, should he win, as it outlines a comprehensive roadmap to dismantle what he refers to as the \"deep state.\"Experts also point out that the project has an authoritarian approach and is heavily based on \"loyalty\" that will erode the principle of nonpartisan governance and meritocracy. Project 2025 includes several dangerous measures, such as eliminating the Departments of Education and Homeland Security and placing the FBI directly under the presidential authority.According to the same project, thousands of government employees and qualified civil servants would be dismissed and replaced by a carefully selected group loyal to Trump and supportive of conservative policies.There are also significant concerns that civil rights and freedoms could experience a major setback in the event of a second Trump presidency. It is very likely that he could make decisions affecting freedom of expression and the right to protest taking into consideration his stance on the media, racial justice, voting rights, etc ... taking into consideration that some of the U.S. Supreme Court members were his appointees during his first term. In his current campaign rallies, Trump does not hesitate to attack all his opponents and critics among individuals and institutions. It is also worth noting that the 2025 Project includes many measures that threaten rights and freedoms. Using his presidential authorities, analysts do not preclude the possibility that Trump could call for the intervention of the National Guard to suppress civil society activities, such as preventing protests and mass rallies that criticize his policies, like the historic national \"Women's March\" that took place on January 23, 2017, as the first large civil society protest in response to his general policies after his inauguration as the new president.Sharp Polarization within American Society: American society has always experienced a degree of polarization, but it has intensified in the last two decades. This polarization is currently reflected by the tight race between the Democratic and Republican campaigns as polls indicate that each party has maintained its voter base since 2020.The deadlock in Congress, where laws are rarely passed in a bi-partisan way also reflects this polarization as both parties persist to oppose each other, often for political calculations that frequently disregard the public interest. One example was in 2023 when we witnessed how the Republican Kevin McCarthy paid the price when he worked with the Democratic Party to pass the federal budget in Congress to avoid another catastrophic government shutdown. As a consequence, McCarthy was removed from his position as Speaker of the House by members of his party.Increasing Level of Political Violence Rhetoric, especially promoted by Trump and his Republican supporters, has become evident through the spread of fake news and incitement against Democrats, immigrants, and any opponent. In its October 2023 issue, Time Magazine indicates that more than 33% of Republicans expressed that violence might be the solution to \"save\" the United States.Another poll by The New York Times indicates that 450 federal judges received threats last year, a 150% increase compared to 2019; while members of Congress received 8,000 threats, a 50% increase compared to 2018. One example of this rhetoric is the false and dangerous racist claims that Trump made about Haitian immigrants during the presidential debate with Harris on September 10th of this year.In other rallies, he also declared that he would deport all supporters of Palestine and those calling for #Ceasefire_in_Gaza, claiming that they support Hamas and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). Moreover, Trump continues to implicitly encourage political violence by repeatedly promising a presidential pardon for those involved in the attack on the U.S. Capitol in 2021. He also attacks and criticizes anyone who supports the Democratic campaign or opposes his campaign, including prominent figures from politics, art, and other fields. This rhetoric of violence is further fueled by Trump's attacks on and questioning of electoral governance institutions and the judiciary, particularly after all such entities affirmed that the 2020 election results were free from any violations that could undermine its credibility. It is also worth mentioning that many legal and political experts assert that both the Department of Justice and Congress made a grave mistake by not preventing Trump from running for office again, especially after it was demonstrated that he incited the 2021 U.S. Capitol attack. The absence of such a measure has allowed him to move forward as a presidential candidate and emboldened him to continue his populist and racist rhetoric, which incites violence and threatens social peace.Weakening Trust between Citizens, State Institutions, and Elected Officials: the widening gap between the rich and the poor in the United States over the past decades has significantly undermined trust in the government. Numerous studies have revealed that a large segment of the middle class has fallen behind and has felt abandoned by the state and is seeking change. This is due to public policies that favor the wealthy and fail to strengthen citizens' socio-economic rights in areas such as employment, healthcare, and education.The issue of \"gun violence\" is a good example of this broken trust. Despite the tragic repetitive shooting incidents by ordinary citizens that threaten American lives more than anything else, and despite the large mobilization and calls organized by civil society groups like \"The March of Our Lives\" Movement, Congress remains unable to take any meaningful action to restrict guns access, largely because of the pressure of the gun manufacturing lobbies like the National Rifle Association.The \"Occupy Wall Street\" Movement is another example that depicts citizens' outcry against the economic inequality, disparities, corporate greed, and use of money in politics as well as complete dissatisfaction with entities that are largely granted financial advantages by lawmakers but fail to deliver the promised prosperity to ordinary citizens.This growing frustration has been skillfully exploited by Trump to gain support for his campaign, adopting the slogan \"Make America Great Again\" (MAGA). He promises voters that he will bring back investments and the jobs that were outsourced abroad and will impose high tariffs to achieve this goal. Trump further taps into this discontent by speaking about the \"deep state,\" claiming that his goal as President is to dismantle it because it has pursued policies that do not serve ordinary citizens. Thus, he calls on voters to support him so that he can restore their socio-economic rights. On the other hand, the Biden administration's stance regarding the war on Gaza, providing unconditional support to Israel with taxpayer money, has also deepened the lack of trust in state institutions and political actors, particularly among youth. The administration's actions in this regard are seen as a violation of international and U.S. law creating a moral crisis that is expected to cast a shadow over the upcoming presidential elections on November 5th and beyond.With just a few weeks remaining before Election Day, the day after remains open to several possibilities and questions that are expected to impact the dynamics within the political landscape and most importantly the democratic process in the United States. As such will the war on Gaza have a direct impact on the presidential election results in general, and on the Democratic Party in particular making it an unprecedented event in recent U.S. electoral history as foreign policy issues are often a low priority for American voters? And how will the Democratic Party handle this new variable to regain the trust of the voters it would have lost?Will increased voter abstention, especially among the youth, create a surprise in this election, given that those demanding a Cease-Fire in Gaza, particularly as the conflict has expanded to Lebanon, are expected to stay away from the ballot boxes, along with the undecided who are not convinced by the political offers of either party and reject the idea of voting for the \"lesser evil\"? And how will this abstention impact the election outcome?Will a third-party vote create a surprise this time and lead to the rise of the Green Party as another political entity that could break the binary nature of the U.S. political system and present an alternative to voters who no longer find appeal in the political platforms of Democrats and Republicans?Furthermore, in the event of Trump's win, to what extent will the pillars of the democratic system and its institutions withstand his authoritarian tendencies and the rise of his far-right supporters? And will such a scenario serve as a serious wake-up call for political and civil society actors in the U.S. to engage in a constructive dialogue about a range of pressing issues, such as electoral campaign financing, racial justice; electoral system, particularly the Electoral College; and the role of money and lobbies in the electoral process as well as its influence on public policies? And could this event lead to a revival of a \"Founding Fathers Moment\" aiming to foster a dialogue that would establish a new social contract that ensures social peace in the U.S., safeguard the public interest, and strengthen the country's democratic institutions to reaffirm their role to serve citizens and protect their rights?The Author's views don't reflect any institutional affiliation.Hashtags: #USAPresidentiaElections2024 #UncommittedMovement #Undecided Voters #ThreatsToDemocracy #ElectionIntegrity #CeaseFireinGazaNow #ThirdPartyVote #DemocracyInChallenge #KamalaHarris #DonaldTrump #polirazation #politicalviolence #Project 2025 #PopulistDiscourse #Racism #© Morocco World News.",

    "content": "By Katelyn Caralle, Senior U.S. Political Reporter In Washington, D.C.Kamala Harris is facing the ire of TIME's owner after she refused to sit for an interview with the renowned news magazine.The vice president has refused to sit for an interview with several legacy media outlets since taking over Joe Biden's campaign leading the Democratic 2024 presidential ticket and has faced a slew of criticism for her sparse media strategy.Marc Benioff wrote of his disappointment on X, claiming Time Magazine has reached out several times for an interview with the presidential nominee.'Despite multiple requests, TIME has not been granted an interview with Kamala Harris -- unlike every other Presidential candidate,' the owner posted on Sunday.Benioff included a link to interviews Time Magazine conducted with former President Donald Trump and President Biden when he was still running for reelection in 2024.Time owner Marc Benioff (pictured) is furious that Vice President Kamala Harris has declined repeated requests from the Magazine to sit for an interview before the 2024 presidential election'We believe in transparency and publish each interview in full,' he added in the post. 'Why isn't the Vice President engaging with the public on the same level?'Read More Kamala Harris poses for the Vogue cover in her Tiffany earrings in fawning magazine issueThe denouncement of Harris' refusal to interview with the magazine comes as CBS News faces intense backlash for favorably editing its 60 Minutes interview with the candidate.A Time article published on October 10 titled What Kind of President Would Kamala Harris Be? notes that the VP 'declined repeated requests for an interview for this story.''In contrast, Trump talked about his policy vision with a TIME reporter for 90 minutes across two interviews. Biden spoke to TIME at similar length before dropping out of the race,' they added in that article.Critics, especially pro-MAGA social media accounts, have brought into question Harris' media strategy ahead of the election.There are only 22 days until the election next month and Harris has not gone full court press on media appearances like most candidates tend to do in the runup to Election Day.VP Harris' media strategy has been brought into question by critics after she has snubbed a number of legacy and traditional media outlets in favor of more alternative outlets - like the raunchy, sex-focused Call Her Daddy podcastThe VP has engaged in some questionable interviews, like with the raunchy and sex-focused podcast Call Her Daddy.

    "content": "Source: The Conversation - USA - By Boris Heersink, Associate Professor of Political Science, Fordham UniversityThe recovery in both states is expected to extend far beyond the November 2024 election period. The majority of the people in the affected communities in North Carolina and Florida voted for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in 2020, making some election analysts wonder if some Trump supporters will be able to cast their ballots.Amy Lieberman, a politics and society editor at The Conversation U.S., spoke with Boris Heersink, a scholar of voters' behavior after a natural disaster, to better understand if and how the recent hurricanes could shift the results of the 2024 presidential election.A massive hurricane disrupts people's lives in many important ways, including affecting people's personal safety and where they can live. Ahead of an election, there are a lot of practical limitations about how an election can be executed - like if a person can still receive mail-in ballots at home or elsewhere, or if it is possible to still vote in person at their polling location if that building was destroyed or damaged.Another issue is whether people who have just lived through a natural disaster and will likely be dealing with the aftermath for weeks to come are focused on politics right now. Some might sit out the election because they simply have more important things to worry about.The other side of the equation, which is what political scientists like myself are mostly focusing on, is whether people take the fact that a natural disaster happened into consideration when they vote.Two scholars, Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels, have argued that sometimes voters are not great at figuring out how to incorporate bad things that happened to them into a voting position. In some cases, it is entirely fair to hold an elected official responsible for bad outcomes that affect people's lives. But at other moments, bad things can happen to us without that being the fault of an incumbent president or governor. And voters should ideally be able to balance out these different types of bad things - those it is fair to punish elected officials for, and those for which it isn't fair to hold them responsible.After all, a devastating hurricane is terrible, but it is not Kamala Harris' fault that it happened. But Achen and Bartels argue that voters frequently still punish elected officials for random bad events like this.Their most famous example is the consequences of a series of shark attacks off the New Jersey coast in the summer of 1916. As a result of those attacks, the New Jersey tourism industry saw a major decline. While these findings are still being debated, Achen and Bartels argue that Jersey shore voters subsequently voted against Woodrow Wilson in the 1916 presidential election at a higher rate than they would have had the shark attacks not happened. They argue that voters did this even though Wilson had no involvement in the shark attacks.Scholars like John Gasper and Andrew Reeves argue that voters mostly care whether elected officials respond appropriately to a disaster. So, if the president does a good job reacting, voters do not actually punish them at all in the next election. However, voters can punish elected officials if they feel like the response is not correct.The fact that Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana in 2005 was not the fault of then-President George W. Bush. But the perceived slowness of the government response is something a voter could have held him responsible for.Colleagues and I have shown that how people interpret the combination of a disaster and the government response is likely colored by their own partisanship.We looked at both the effects of Superstorm Sandy on the 2012 presidential election and natural disasters' impact on elections more broadly from 1972 through 2004. One core finding is that when presidents reject state officials' disaster declaration requests, they lose votes in affected counties - but only if those counties were already more supportive of the opposite party.If there is a strong positive government response, the incumbent president or their party can actually gain votes or lose voters affected by a disaster. So, Republicans affected by the hurricanes could become more inclined to vote against Harris if they feel like they are not getting the help they need. But it could also help Harris if affected Democrats feel like they are getting enough aid.The major takeaway is that if the government responds really effectively to a natural disaster or other emergency, there is not a huge electoral penalty - and there could even be a small reward.That is not irrelevant in a close election. If Republicans in affected areas in North Carolina feel the government response has been poor and it inspires them to turn out in higher numbers to punish Harris, that could matter. But if they feel like the response has been adequate, research suggests either no real effect on their support for Harris - or possibly even an increase in Harris voters.Scholars mostly assume that people affected can tell whether the government response was good or not. Trump and other Republicans are falsely saying that the response is slow and falsely claiming that Federal Emergency Management Agency money is being spent on immigrants who are not living in the country legally. There does not appear to be a slow government response to the hurricane in North Carolina, and there's no evidence the response is insufficient in Florida, either.So, the question now is whether voters affected by these hurricanes will respond based on their actual lived experiences, or how they are told they are living their experience.Boris Heersink receives funding from the Russell Sage Foundation.",

    "title": "\"Fake and Classless\": Trump Slams The Apprentice Biopic Following Assault Allegations Against Ivana",
    "content": "Donald Trump criticized the biopic *The Apprentice*, which depicts a violent scene involving his late ex-wife Ivana, calling it \"fake and classless.\" He expressed outrage over its release and its implications.Former President Donald Trump has responded vehemently to the allegations surrounding the biographical drama film The Apprentice, which portrays an unsettling incident involving his late ex-wife, Ivana Trump. The film, which debuted in the U.S. on Friday, stars Sebastian Stan as Trump and Jeremy Strong as Roy Cohn. It reflects on Trump's rise as a real estate mogul in New York during the late 20th century.The film includes a deeply distressing scene in which Trump violently pushes Ivana to the ground and assaults her, a moment that has ignited widespread backlash. In light of these allegations, Trump characterized the filmmakers' portrayal of his relationship with Ivana, who died in 2022, as misleading. He asserted they had a \"great relationship... until the day she died.\"Taking to Truth Social, Trump slammed The Apprentice as a \"fake and classless\" production, expressing outrage at the filmmakers for using his name without permission. He described the movie as a \"cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job,\" intended to undermine his political movement ahead of the 2024 presidential election.\"It's an effort to hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country, 'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!'\" he stated. Trump also criticized Gabe Sherman, the film's writer, calling him a \"lowlife and talentless hack\" and lamented the lack of accountability for those creating narratives he perceives as harmful.The controversial scene in The Apprentice draws inspiration from Ivana's court deposition during her 1990 divorce from Trump, a statement she later retracted in 2015. Journalist Harry Hurt III, who investigated the divorce case, claimed that Trump's frustration over a scalp procedure led to the violent altercation depicted in the film.The film's writer noted that the dramatized scene is \"actually far more graphic and brutal than the one we dramatized in the film,\" adding to the ongoing debate about the accuracy and ethical implications of such portrayals.",

    "content": "Donald Trump broke his silence amidst shocking allegations of sexually assaulting his ex-wife Ivana, who passed away in 2022. The ex-President blasted the creators of the biographical drama film, The Apprentice, which reflects on the journey of Trump as a real estate businessman in New York in the 1970s and 1980s.The film, which was released in the US on Friday, features Sebastian Stan as Trump, and Jeremy Strong as Republican operative Roy Cohn. In one heartbreaking scene, Trump pushes his first wife, Ivana, to the ground and sexually abuses her while she begs him to stop.While the scene has sparked controversy, the former President claimed he and his ex-wife had a \"great relationship... until the day she died.\"Taking to Truth Social, Trump called The Apprentice a \"fake and classless\" movie, questioning thee makers' rights to use that name without approval.\"It's a cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country, \"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" he wrote.He then described Ivana as a \"kind and wonderful person\", with whom he said, \"had a great relationship with her until the day she died.\"\"The writer of this pile of garbage, Gabe Sherman, a lowlife and talentless hack, who has long been widely discredited, knew that, but chose to ignore it,\" he continued.\"So sad that HUMAN SCUM, like the people involved in this hopefully unsuccessful enterprise, are allowed to say and do whatever they want in order to hurt a Political Movement, which is far bigger than any of us,\" the ex-President concluded.Also Read: Kamala Harris challenges Donald Trump to release his medical records, calls him 'weak and unstable' to lead AmericaThe horrific scene in The Apprentice was taken from a court deposition that Ivana made during her 1990 divorce from Trump -- which she later repudiated in 2015 during his first presidential campaign.Harry Hurt III, a journalist who was investigating the case, claimed that Trump was upset because the \"scalp reduction\" he had requested to remove a bald spot was irritating and painful.According to Hurt, Trump ripped out a handful of his wife's hair and started sexually assaulting her as he was upset that Ivana had suggested the physician.\"Does it hurt?\" he asked her the next morning.According to the film's writer, the scene that Ivana narrated in her divorce papers was \"actually far more graphic and brutal than the one we dramatized in the film.\"",

    "content": "The 2024 presidential election appears to be coming down to the wire.A new ABC News/Ipsos poll shows only 2 percentage points divide Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. The poll shows 50% of registered voters backing Harris vs. 48% for Trump. Among all adults, regardless of registration status, the race narrows to a single point - 49% for Harris, 48% for Trump.In the previous ABC/Ipsos poll taken in September, Harris was leading by 4 points among registered voters and 5 points among likely voters.Economic issues continue to be the largest concern for most voters, a factor that benefits Trump. The GOP nominee leads Harris by 8 points overall on who voters trust to handle the economy (46% to 38%) and 7 points on inflation (44% to 37%), results that have been consistent since August. More voters, however, thought Harris was looking out better for the middle class (42% - 37%).Trump holds single-digit polling leads on handling crime and safety, national security and conflict in the Middle East. Harris holds a similar lead in \"protecting American democracy.\"Both candidates struggle with favorability. Forty-four percent of those polled said they see Harris favorably vs. 35% who said the same for Trump. Harris' favorability rating lost 3 points in the poll, and 47% now see her unfavorably. Fifty-eight percent said they have an unfavorable view of Trump.Forty-eight percent said they see Harris as \"too liberal\" compared to 43% who see Trump as too conservative while 41% said Harris is ideologically \"about right.\" Forty-three percent said Trump was \"ideologically \"about right.\"Battleground statesIn traditional Republican states, Trump is comfortably ahead 55% to 42%, the poll showed. In blue states, Harris is ahead 56% to 39%. In seven key battleground states - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - the race is a dead heat at 49% each.The ABC News/Ipsos poll was conducted Oct. 4-8 among a random sample of 2,631 adults.

    "title": "Abortion tops inflation as key issue for young female voters in 2024 election",
    "content": "Nationally, abortion has emerged as a critical issue, particularly for young women voters, and its significance in the 2024 presidential election cannot be understated. According to a recent KFF survey, 2 in 5 women under 30 now consider abortion the most important issue, a dramatic increase from just 1 in 5 earlier in the year. This shift underscores the heightened impact of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade and dismantled federal abortion protections.Vice President Kamala Harris, now the Democratic presidential nominee, has centered her campaign on abortion access, positioning it as a key dividing issue between herself and former President Donald Trump. Trump's three Supreme Court appointments directly contributed to the court's decision, and Harris has leveraged this to appeal to younger voters, whose support could prove crucial. The KFF survey highlights how this issue has overtaken inflation, which had been the top concern among younger voters.While abortion dominates the concerns of women under 30, the KFF survey shows that women over 30 still prioritize economic issues like inflation, followed closely by concerns about threats to democracy. However, abortion remains a significant concern for women overall, ranking third, ahead of issues like immigration. This suggests that while the intensity of the abortion debate varies by age group, it is still a critical issue influencing the 2024 election.In Alabama, the state's abortion law is among the most restrictive in the country, banning abortion at any stage of pregnancy without exceptions for rape or incest. Alabama's 2019 Human Life Protection Act, which criminalizes abortion providers, only permits the procedure when the mother's life is at serious risk. Since *Dobbs*, Alabama has been at the forefront of states enforcing stringent abortion restrictions. Despite public outcry and the growing focus on abortion nationally, Alabama voters are offered no direct recourse, such as ballot measures, to challenge or amend the state's abortion laws.The state's rigid abortion law reflects the broader trend of Republican-controlled states enacting near-total bans on abortion. In contrast, some states have responded by passing ballot measures that protect abortion rights in their constitutions, as seen in places like Michigan and Kansas. However, in Alabama, efforts to broaden reproductive rights have faced significant legal and political challenges. Attorney General Steve Marshall has even threatened to prosecute those assisting individuals in obtaining out-of-state abortions, leading to legal battles over free speech and the right to travel.As the 2024 presidential race continues, abortion is likely to remain a key issue, particularly in states like Alabama, where the restrictive laws highlight the stark contrast in how different regions of the U.S. approach reproductive rights.",

Kathleen is a proud alumna of the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism. Here's a shocker; she is from New York City.Former President Donald Trump suffered a movie meltdown early Monday morning that saw him claim he owns the words \"The Apprentice.\"Trump railed against \"The Apprentice\" two days after the biopic about his relationship with disbarred attorney Roy Cohn -- chief counsel for Sen.

    "title": "How democratic is the US really?",
    "content": "When Americans elect their next president in November, the one with the most votes might not be the winner. Democracy in the US comes with some quirks -- and was under attack not too long ago. How is it faring today?For a long time, the US viewed itself as an exemplary democracy: A country other nations could look to when building their own democracies after gaining independence or shedding authoritarian regimes.That idea is manifested in the \"city upon a hill\" metaphor. Politicians from John F. Kennedy to Barack Obama have referred to the US as a glowing beacon, drawing everyone's eyes. In 1961, President-elect Kennedy said the world was still looking to the US and its democracy, and that \"our governments, in every branch, at every level, national, state and local, must be as a city upon a hill.\"On January 6, 2021, the world's eyes were on the US. That day, a mob of right-wing extremists, encouraged by then-still-president Donald Trump, stormed the US Capitol in an attempt to interrupt the democratic transfer of power after the 2020 election.And in a 2023 poll by the Associated Press news agency in cooperation with the University of Chicago, only 10% of participants said that democracy in the US was working extremely or very well.So what is the state of US democracy today, ahead of the 2024 presidential election?\"I think it's fair to say Americans don't have a lot of trust right now in governmental institutions,\" Michael Berkman, director of the McCourtney Institute for Democracy and a political science professor at Pennsylvania State University told DW. \"They're looking at a Congress that is not functioning well at all and they're looking at some rather intractable problems that government has not really addressed, like gun violence and climate change.\"With their inability to choose a leader, the Republican majority in the House of Representatives paralyzed Congress for weeks in October 2023. But even without interruptions like this, getting any laws through both chambers of Congress -- the House and the Senate -- is slow going because of the deeply entrenched partisanship between Republicans and Democrats.\"It is extremely difficult, sometimes impossible, to pass legislation even when overwhelming majorities of the public support a measure,\" Vanessa Williamson, a senior fellow in governance studies at US think tank the Brookings Institution, told DW. \"There is very serious dysfunction in Washington.\"The harsh polarization, the gulf between Democratic and Republican supporters, means that at least half the country is likely to be extremely unhappy with many decisions the elected government is making.After the 2020 elections, many Republicans (lead by Trump) were so unhappy with the election results that they tried to ignore them, falsely claiming the election was \"stolen\" from them so vehemently that eventually, a mob of those who believed it stormed the Capitol. A peaceful transition of power is one of the hallmarks of democracy, and that almost didn't happen in the US.\"I think what happened on January 6 and the refusal of one side to accept the results of the election is very damaging for a democracy, since accepting the outcome of an election is pretty much central to democratic politics,\" Berkman said.It is not surprising then that trust in democratic institutions has gone down in recent years. But there's more you might not expect from a country like the US.\"In addition to the recent forms of democratic erosion, the United States has many anti-democratic practices of very long standing,\" Williamson said.Chief among them: The winner of the presidential election is not necessarily the one with the most votes.Most recently, Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election even though his opponent, Hillary Clinton, garnered roughly 2.9 million more votes than him. The reason behind this conundrum is the electoral college. In the US, each of the 50 states has a certain number of electors depending on its population size. The candidate who wins the majority of the people's votes in a state is the one who gets the state's electoral votes. Sounds complicated? Here's an example.California as the most populous state has the most electors in the electoral college: 54. The candidate who can get the most Californians to vote for them will receive all 54 of these elector votes, even if they only won the popular vote in California by a narrow margin. Smaller states like Vermont or South Dakota only have three electoral college votes, but the system is the same.To win the presidency, a candidate must win in enough states to bring his electoral college vote up to 270 electors or more. Someone who wins states by small margins can thus become president, even though more Americans in total voted for the other candidate.Another part of the US political system that does not reflect a perfect democracy is the upper chamber of Congress: The US Senate. Each US state has two senators in the chamber -- no matter the state's population size.That means in some states, one senator represents a few hundred thousand people, while in another, a couple of million people \"share\" a senator. When the Senate has a decision to make, each senator's vote holds exactly the same weight, even though they represent vastly different numbers of people.Berkman calls the Senate \"a deeply undemocratic institution.\" And Williamson says that as a result of the way the Senate is set up, \"our most populous regions are profoundly underrepresented in the legislative process.\"The US might not be a model democracy, but Americans haven't given up on it. More people are getting involved.The voter turnout in the 2020 presidential election stood at more than 65%, higher than it had been in more than 100 years.\"You see increased political participation over the last eight, 10 years,\" Berkman said. \"And I think that's important.\"",

    "title": "Explainer series: The 2024 White House race (1/6): Voting, eligibility, and the path to inauguration",
    "content": "As the 2024 US presidential election draws near, the first instalment in our explainer series provides an overview of key processes, rules, and traditions that shape this pivotal event in American democracy, from voter registration and mail-in ballots to candidate eligibility and the transfer of power.Voters, pundits, and global observers are gearing up for what promises to be another defining moment in modern American history. With election day just around the corner, this first instalment in our explainer series delves into the key processes, traditions, and rules that shape the election.From understanding the complexities of voter registration and mail-in ballots to exploring the eligibility criteria for presidential candidates and the transfer of power, we provide a comprehensive guide to navigating the US electoral system and the race for the White House, which could bring significant changes to the political landscape.First things first: when is the 2024 US presidential election taking place?As per tradition, or rather as stipulated by US election law, voters will head to the polling stations on \"Tuesday next after the 1st Monday in November\" of an election year, which in 2024 will be Tuesday, 5 November. This is largely due to the practical concerns of 19th-century America, which was predominantly rural and agrarian.How are people voting?Those able to vote in person will head to the polling stations on election day. Before they can do so, however, voters have to register. The exact requirements and procedures vary by state, but generally, citizens must be at least 18 years old, a resident of their state, and meet other criteria like not being a felon (depending on state laws). Registration can be done online, by mail, or in person at designated government offices. And some states even allow for same-day registration at polling places.Once registered, voters are assigned a polling location in their respective voting district, which further subdivide each state. For those opting to vote in person, this is where they will head come election day. The polling stations are usually set up in public buildings, like schools or libraries, and are operated by volunteers. After casting their vote, people may then participate in the so-called exit polls, which allow for early and more or less accurate projections ahead of the actual vote count.While 5 November is considered the official election day, parts of the voting process are in fact already completed beforehand. Absentee and mail-in ballots, for which people can register if they know that they will not be able to vote in person, can be filled out up to three weeks ahead of election day. However, these ballots are still only processed on election day itself, even if sent ahead of time.Aside from casting their vote for president on 5 November, people will, depending on their home state, also help decide additional races, including all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 34 of the 100 seats in the Senate, as both bodies are up for regular elections. Additionally, many states will hold gubernatorial elections, with 11 states electing new governors. Numerous state legislatures, local offices, and various ballot measures on issues such as taxes, healthcare, and education will also be decided on that day.Who can run for the highest office in the country?While the United States pride themselves in the notion of the 'American Dream' by which every person has the freedom and opportunity to come to the States and succeed, there are certain limitations to be noted when it comes to aiming all the way up to the US presidency.For one, only natural-born citizens can throw their hats in the race, meaning that a person has to be born a US citizen to be eligible to run for the Oval Office. This makes the presidency different from other positions, like governorships for instance, where somebody like Arnold Schwarzenegger is eligible to run despite not having been born in the States.US presidential candidates must also be at least 35 years of age on the day of the eventual inauguration, which usually takes place around 10 weeks after election day. This is the highest age requirement in the US political system, with house representatives mandated to be at least 25 years and senators at least 30. There is no upper age limit for any of these positions.Finally, any presidential candidate must have resided in the US for at least 14 years. These three criteria not only apply to the presidential candidates, but also for their running mate, who, in case of victory, will assume the role of vice president on inauguration day.How often can a person be president?Since George Washington, the first US President, decided not to seek a third term, it has long been believed that two terms should be the limit for any president. This was however not put into law until much later in time.In fact, Franklin D Roosevelt became the first-ever US President to serve four terms, in the midst of the Great Depression and World War II from 1933-1945 when he died in office. The two-term limit as known in modern times was only instituted in 1951 through the 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution.When does the new president take the oath of office?The time between election day and the presidential inauguration is commonly known as the peaceful transfer of power. During this time, the winner is usually referred to as the 'president-elect'. 2025 will thus mark the 60th inauguration in US history, with the winner of the 2024 election taking the oath of office in front of the US Capitol on 20 January.The inauguration has in recent years grown to be an ever-more festive event, including live music and inspiring speeches by notable guests. The highlight of the event, however, is the swearing-in ceremony, followed by the presidents first address to the nation. In this speech, presidents usually strike a unifying tone and seek to lay out their vision for the upcoming four years. On 20 January 2025, this message will come from either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump.",

    "title": "Catching the Carjackers",
    "content": "On the road with an elite police unit as it combats a crime waveOn August 7, 2022, Shantise Summers arrived home from a night out with friends around 2:40 a.m. As she walked from her car toward her apartment in Oxon Hill, a Maryland neighborhood just southeast of Washington, D.C., she heard footsteps behind her. She turned and saw two men in ski masks. One put a gun to her face; she could feel the metal pressing against her chin. He demanded her phone, wallet, keys, and Apple Watch. She quickly handed them over, and they drove off in her 2019 Honda Accord.She called the police, and later that morning, a patrol officer spotted her Accord with several teenage boys in it. When the officer approached, the teens fled. As they sped down Alabama Avenue, in Southeast D.C., they collided with a city bus, then crashed into a pole. One was seriously injured. Two of the teens had been arrested for armed carjacking eight months earlier; one was still on probation. This was in keeping with what police had been regularly seeing: the same perpetrators arrested for carjackings again and again, even after getting caught.Summers took three days off from work. She kept thinking about the feel of the gun on her skin, the way those seconds had stretched on interminably, the terror of believing that she would leave her children motherless. She was too scared to sleep at night, and afraid to leave her apartment. In need of groceries, she finally forced herself to walk to Safeway. \"Every teenage African American male I saw, I'd freeze up,\" Summers, who is Black, told me. \"I was standing in the middle of the store crying and shaking.\"Now her fear was overlaid with guilt. Here she was, a Black woman who considered herself progressive, stereotyping young Black men as threats.Summers is a single mother of four who works for the U.S. Postal Service. To pay for a new car, she had to take a second job that had her working until 11 o'clock every night, after her eight-hour shift at the post office. All the while, she was consumed with fear that the suspects, who knew where she lived, would come back and hurt her in retaliation for calling the police. She moved out of the apartment she'd lived in for eight years.Two of the carjackers took a plea deal; the assistant state attorney declined to prosecute the one who had been seriously injured in the crash. This past January, at a hearing for the fourth suspect, who'd been 16 at the time of the offense, the judge ordered his family to pay $2,000 in restitution (which Summers says she has not received, and doesn't ever expect to), then let him go. He walked out of court ahead of her.Summers found herself puzzled by the language of juvenile court. Kids are called \"respondents\" rather than \"defendants.\" They get found \"involved\" rather than \"guilty.\" \"We're treating them like children,\" Summers told me. \"But there was nothing childlike about what they did to me.\" Summers believes that all four should have faced jail time. \"They're violent thieves, scary thieves,\" she told me. \"What will they become next? Because the system just told them armed carjacking is okay.\"On a June evening about six months later, Detective Darren Dalton peered into the fading light, trying to determine the make and model of the vehicle approaching him. For the past two hours, ever since the call had gone out that a Cadillac Escalade had been stolen at gunpoint, Dalton and four other police investigators had been hunting for it.Dalton, a 15-year police veteran, is one of a dozen detectives on the new Prince George's County Carjacking Interdiction Unit. In the District of Columbia and the surrounding area, which includes Prince George's County pressed up against most of the city's eastern border, this crime has become an offense committed not just by seasoned criminals but by adolescents looking to rob people, go for a joyride, and beef up their street-tough bona fides. Since early 2023, a third of the unit's detectives have been shot at or have fired their own gun while pursuing carjackers.In 2020, the killing of George Floyd transformed the politics of policing in America. That summer, consensus solidified not just on the left but in the political center that tough-on-crime policies had had a net negative effect -- and a disproportionate impact on poor Black neighborhoods. Politicians moved quickly to meet the moment. Many communities, including D.C., diverted money away from police departments and talked about directing it instead toward addressing crime's chronic causes: the insufficient number of jobs paying a living wage, failing schools, run-down public housing.But during the pandemic, violent crime exploded around the country. This was especially true in the Washington area. By 2023, homicides in D.C. had climbed to a level not seen in a quarter century. Carjackings rose even more. They were happening everywhere, to everyone: a mother buckling in her children outside an elementary school; a food-delivery driver making his final stop of the day; a 90-year-old who watched the carjackers drive off with her late spouse's ashes.Some of the victims were high-profile. In October of last year, three masked men carjacked Henry Cuellar, a Democratic congressman from Texas, as he arrived at his apartment, making off with his Toyota, phone, iPad, and sushi dinner. In January, Mike Gill, a 56-year-old father of three who'd served as the chief of staff for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, was driving his new Jeep to pick up his wife from her law office in downtown D.C. when a man climbed into his car and shot him. Gill's wife found him in a pool of blood on the sidewalk outside her office, one foot still inside the Jeep; he would die in the hospital several days later. (Within hours of shooting Gill, his assailant successfully carried out three additional carjackings, and killed one other person.) Even law-enforcement officers have been victimized: In the past year, carjackers have attacked a police officer driving an unmarked car, stolen an FBI agent's car -- pushing her to the ground near the Capitol before making off with her Chevy Malibu -- and tried to steal the car of the two deputy U.S. Marshals on protective detail near Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor's home. (This attempt was thwarted when a Marshal shot one of the carjackers in the mouth.)David A. Graham: Does being a victim of crime shift a politician's views?Even when the pandemic abated, carjackings kept increasing. In 2019, Prince George's County police officers investigated fewer than 100 carjackings; by the end of 2023, that number had risen to more than 500. Angela D. Alsobrooks, the Prince George's County executive, said the community was \"under siege.\" \"I don't feel safe stopping at a gas station,\" she said at a press conference. In Washington, the number of carjackings more than doubled from 2019 to 2020, from 152 to 360, and then kept climbing -- to 484 in 2022, and 958 in 2023. This startling increase stemmed from a complex and still somewhat mysterious set of factors, but prominent among them, at least according to cops in the Carjacking Interdiction Unit, were protracted school closings, which fueled truancy and juvenile crime; police reforms that restricted the ability to fight crime effectively; and a new hesitancy among some officers about risking their career or their life in a political atmosphere (\"Defund the police!\") that they felt villainized them more than the criminals.On that night this past June, the stolen Escalade and Dalton's unmarked Mazda CX-9 passed each other driving in opposite directions along D.C.'s border with Maryland. Dalton didn't want to spook the carjackers, so he waited until the Escalade's brake lights disappeared over a hill in his rearview mirror, then made a quick U-turn. He accelerated to catch up, sliding into position about eight cars behind the stolen SUV, then slowly moved in closer, weaving through traffic until he was three cars back. Other detectives from his unit, also in unmarked cars, were heading toward him from across the county. They would take turns following the Escalade.If the SUV turned left, staying in Maryland, the detectives could chase it. But if it slipped across the D.C. line, the officers would have a harder time getting permission to chase it. This, too, was an outgrowth of the changing politics of policing over the past decade: Communities all over the country had placed new restraints on police departments' ability to aggressively pursue criminals. There were good reasons for these reforms -- tragic examples of police overreach and outright abuse, especially in predominantly Black neighborhoods, were common. But police say this sudden overhaul had serious unintended consequences: more murders, more carjackings, and more violent crimes of other sorts, most of them in the very communities that the police reforms had ostensibly been aimed at protecting.Among the new limits placed on police in D.C. was an effective ban on high-speed car chases, which too often end up killing innocent bystanders, or the police officers themselves. But the spike in carjackings had been so extreme that by now, in 2024, the city had been compelled to loosen its restrictions a bit. Still, Dalton and his fellow detectives weren't sure they would be able to get permission, so they were hoping the Escalade stayed on the Maryland side of the border.Dalton followed for two more miles, to the intersection of Southern and Branch Avenues. A crucial moment.\"Left turn onto Branch,\" Dalton said into the radio. The car was staying in Maryland.At a stoplight, Dalton pulled up next to the Escalade and finally got a look inside. The driver wore a blue surgical mask and a hoodie cinched tight around his face. The front-seat passenger was wearing a black ski mask, with only his eyes showing.In the distance, a police helicopter thumped across the sky, positioning itself overhead. As Dalton steadied his breathing, a fleet of patrol cars converged, preparing to give chase.Stealing cars is as old as making them; as soon as Henry Ford's factories began churning out Model T's in the early 1900s, people began swiping them. But over time, car alarms and anti-theft systems made them harder to steal. You could no longer take most vehicles just by pushing a screwdriver into the ignition or manipulating wires. Which is partly why, in the 1980s and '90s, another type of car theft exploded: stealing occupied cars at gunpoint. In 1991, Scott Bowles, a police reporter for The Detroit News, wrote a story about Ruth Wahl, a 22-year-old drugstore cashier who'd been shot and killed after refusing to give up her Suzuki Sidekick. Bowles described this crime as a \"carjacking.\"The word would soon be inscribed in the American consciousness because of stories like this one: On a September morning in 1992, Pam Basu, a 34-year-old chemist, left her Maryland townhouse to take her 22-month-old daughter to her first day of preschool. When she pulled up at a stop sign, two men forced Basu out of her BMW. As she tried to grab her daughter from her car seat, screaming \"My baby!,\" the suspects took off. Basu, caught in a seat belt, ran alongside the car, then tripped and bounced on the pavement. The suspects dragged her for about two miles, leaving behind a trail of flesh, clothing, and blood. Basu, who died from her injuries, \"looked like a rag doll,\" a witness later told jurors. \"It was the worst thing I've ever seen.\" A neighbor found the car seat in the road, the toddler uninjured. Stories like Basu's helped fuel the '90s panic about vicious \"superpredators\" and led to the passage of the federal Anti Car Theft Act of 1992, which made carjacking a federal crime, punishable by a possible life sentence.Criminologists found carjackers to be different from traditional car thieves, most notably in their willingness to commit violence. As Bruce Jacobs, a former criminology professor at the University of Texas at Dallas, has put it, a carjacking is \"a Hobbesian standoff where fear reigns and brute force is the medium of communication.\" Not every criminal has the temperament for it.Carjacking violence can be wanton, even gratuitous. In March 2022, after an Uber driver named Juan Carlos Amaya drove two men to Southeast D.C., they put guns to his head and demanded his keys. Amaya quickly obeyed and got out of his car. One of the men shot him in the leg anyway. \"They already had the car and the key,\" Amaya told a local TV station. \"They just had to leave.\"Major Sunny Mrotek noticed the uptick in carjackings in Prince George's County the month that COVID lockdowns began, in March 2020. By the end of that year, the county police department had logged a 183 percent increase over the previous year. Most of the carjackers in the area were going unpunished -- roughly 70 percent of cases go unsolved. The majority of those caught are younger than 25, and about two-thirds of those arrested for carjacking in D.C. from 2020 to 2024 were juveniles, many of them from predominantly Black neighborhoods hollowed out by economic neglect.Mrotek believed that the pandemic had created an environment ripe for crime. With schools, malls, and recreation centers closed, and in-person access to various social services diminished, more young people were unsupervised. The first pandemic year was bad. \"But then came 2021, and we just got crushed,\" he told me. By year's end, carjackings in Prince George's County had jumped another 49 percent. And for the first time, the number of juvenile carjacking arrests surpassed adult arrests. Mrotek, who had been a cop for three decades, had never seen anything like this.In response, the county's new police chief, Malik Aziz, created the agency's Carjacking Interdiction Unit, centralizing investigations in hopes of improving arrest rates and successfully resolving more cases. Starting in the fall of 2021, a lieutenant, two sergeants, and 12 detectives would handle all carjackings, under Mrotek's supervision.Mrotek handpicked his investigators. He needed officers who had a detective's mind -- part thinking cop, part street cop, with the skills to piece together complex cases; to surveil suspects; and, when necessary, to engage in risky chases by car or on foot. They would wear plain clothes -- not suits and ties, like homicide detectives -- and drive unmarked cars.The carjacking crisis came at a time when police departments were already struggling to hire officers. The Prince George's County Police Department, budgeted for 1,786 sworn officers, has about 350 open positions, leaving the force the smallest it's been in a dozen years. (In 2012, according to Aziz, nearly 8,000 people applied to be police officers in the county; in 2022, only about 800 did, most of them unqualified.) D.C. has lost nearly 500 sworn officers since 2020, leaving the force at a half-century low of 3,285. Many officers who remained were hesitant to do proactive police work, preferring simply to respond to 911 calls. \"The general feeling was If you're not going to fund me, acknowledge me, or appreciate me, I'm going into self-preservation mode,\" Mrotek told me. To Mrotek and his colleagues, the relationship between the retreat from aggressive policing and the explosion of violent crime seemed obvious.Around this time, Mrotek and other detectives noticed that they were arresting the same kids again and again; more than a few wore GPS monitors on their ankle from previous arrests. \"Why are we locking up the same people every time?\" Mrotek wondered.His unit was judged by its numbers: how many cases it closed, how many cars it recovered. So he wanted to see data on what was happening to offenders after they were arrested. Were they getting locked up or released? What was the recidivism rate?Mrotek, who retired this year, found himself frustrated by what he viewed as the \"coddling mindset\" of the juvenile justice system. To better understand what was happening to kids as they went through the system, he began tracking the aftermath of every arrest his team made. He was stunned by what he found: dozens of cases in which teens were arrested for armed carjacking, pleaded to this or to lesser charges, and were released on probation. Kids found to be involved in carjackings rarely seemed to get any significant time in juvenile detention. He compiled a list of what he called the \"top offenders\" -- teens on probation for carjacking who went on to be charged with additional carjackings. Suddenly, explaining the county's carjacking problem seemed simple: If there were no meaningful consequences for committing a crime, kids would just keep committing it. \"This isn't brain surgery,\" Mrotek told me. Kids would say to detectives, \" 'I'm a juvenile -- I'll be home later today.' \" Christina Henderson, a member of the D.C. city council, told me she would hear about offenders committing multiple carjackings. \"That tells me that when he didn't get caught after the first one, there was a feeling of invincibility -- Nothing is going to happen to me; let me keep going.\"Mrotek is a father of two. He doesn't think that a single impulsive decision should derail a kid's future. But some crimes, he believes, are bad enough to require serious consequences, even for minors. \"If you've just finished working 10 hours, stop at a gas station, and two juveniles pistol-whip you and drive off in your car, should they get only probation?\" he said. \"If we're not punishing people for having a gun and violently assaulting people, what's left? Murder?\"I talked with an assistant principal of a 1,200-kid middle school in the metropolitan D.C. area who shares this concern. \"I don't care who you are,\" Ateya Ball-Lacy told me. \"If you are in the community carjacking and putting a gun to somebody's head, you need to be in a restricted environment. Period. Is it jail? Is it juvie? I don't know, but clearly you need to be somewhere you can get help.\"Ball-Lacy grew up in Southwest D.C. during the crack epidemic. Several of her cousins died. \"I never agreed with 'defunding the police,' \" she said. \"When that conversation happened in my school district, we were very clear: That's insane. If we don't have police, who is going to break up the fights? I have a permanently torn rotator cuff as a result of breaking up fights. We cannot pretend that we are not in this place.\"Mrotek proposes a fix that he believes could solve the carjacking problem: If a juvenile pulls a gun during a carjacking, they serve a mandatory three years -- one-tenth of the maximum sentence for adults.\"I guarantee you the numbers will drop real fast,\" he told me.Some people say that society can't arrest its way out of a crime problem. \"Yes, we can,\" Mrotek said. \"It's actually very simple.\"As the sun set, Detective Sara Cavanagh joined Detective Dalton in tailing the Escalade, following it into an apartment complex. The SUV stopped in front of an apartment; two suspects got out of the car and disappeared inside.Cavanagh sat behind the wheel of her unmarked Chevy Equinox and waited. Four other detectives parked nearby, each in a separate unmarked car. Patrol vehicles began lining up along a side street. If the suspects tried to flee in the Escalade, officers would deploy a spike strip -- Teflon-coated metal spikes arrayed along a cord that cops can throw onto the road -- to flatten its tires. The police department's helicopter circled above. If Cavanagh and her colleagues had to give chase, the helicopter would serve as \"the eye,\" with a spotter calling out directions.Cavanagh is the only woman in the Carjacking Interdiction Unit, which tends to attract rough-and-tumble, testosterone-driven types. Her squad's resident gym rat, Rusty Ueno, can bench-press 450 pounds. Many of the detectives have elaborate tattoos, samurai and lions swirling across their biceps, and they fish, hunt, and drink beer together on the weekends. Cavanagh, who is 29, has taken on the role of little sister. She bounces into the office every day, ponytail swinging, chattering nonstop. \"She makes us say hello to her,\" her sergeant, Matt Milburn, grouses. But she has the unit's respect. She is the only woman in the entire department certified to carry a rifle, and many times she is the first to arrive at a crime scene. A former Division I soccer player, Cavanagh can beat anyone in her squad in a foot chase.For Cavanagh, carjacking ranks behind only murder and rape in the hierarchy of awful crimes. She has seen the terror in victims' eyes. The ones that affect her the most are the elderly women. Like the old lady who had been unloading groceries in her driveway when four suspects approached and demanded her car. The woman put up a fight and screamed for help; as she tried to run, one of the men tackled her, breaking her foot. Or the woman in her mid‑80s who was assaulted while parked at an ATM. Three adolescent boys grabbed her cash and pushed her while taking her car keys; she tripped backwards over a concrete parking barrier and hit her head on the ground. When Cavanagh's unit later arrested one of the boys, in a grocery store, they discovered that he was only 12.During the arrest, the kid said something to Detective Dalton about a bullet.He'd been a victim in a triple shooting. A bullet was still lodged in his back.Cavanagh later went to search the house where the kid lived. She found cockroaches everywhere, an empty refrigerator, 10 people crammed in two rooms, old takeout rotting beneath a bed. \"I really didn't want to like this kid -- he'd just carjacked an old lady,\" Cavanagh told me. \"But I felt sorry for him.\"After every arrest, Sergeant Milburn looks up the suspect's prior contact with the criminal-justice system. He estimates that in at least half of the unit's juvenile cases, the suspect has had previous interactions with the police as a victim -- of physical or sexual abuse, for example, or of neglect by a parent or family member. Milburn searched the 12-year-old's history, and sure enough: He'd allegedly been physically abused at 6 years old. \"Most of these kids don't stand a chance,\" Milburn told me. \"I can't tell you how many times we notify parents and they say, 'I don't care,' or 'Just send his ass to Cheltenham' \" -- the county's juvenile detention center. \"That happens more times than not.\"Cavanagh kept her eyes on the Escalade in the gathering dusk. The two suspects emerged from the apartment. \"Carjacking 14,\" she radioed, announcing herself by her call sign. \"I've got two people on foot.\"The suspects climbed into the Escalade and headed toward the complex's exit. Just past the gate, officers were hiding between two cars, where they'd laid the spike strip. Once the vehicle had passed over it, the officers would quickly yank the strip out of the road, to spare the tires of pursuing police cars.From the sky, the helicopter spotter called out the Escalade's movements: The suspects were coming around the corner, approaching the gatehouse. As the Escalade bumped over the spikes, air hissed out of its tires. It wobbled but kept going.The line of patrol cars emerged from the side street, sirens wailing. Cavanagh joined the chase, crossing into a residential neighborhood, bouncing over speed bumps at 40 miles per hour.As the carjackers sped down a hill on their busted tires, they lost control of the Escalade, which veered off the road and smashed into the front of a house. The suspects leaped out and ran. For a long moment, the police radio was quiet as officers chased them on foot.\"Talk to me,\" a dispatcher finally said.\"Got one in custody,\" a breathless patrol officer replied.The second suspect had disappeared into the trees, the vegetation too dense for the helicopter to pick up his heat signature. A supervisor called for a canine unit; perhaps a dog could pick up his scent.Cavanagh raced toward the woodline, listening for the sound of sticks breaking or leaves rustling, then slipping into the trees to search.Brian L. Schwalb, the District's attorney general, told me he was surprised at how quickly the prevailing sentiment had returned to \"Lock 'em up\" when carjackings and other crimes exploded. After all the marches and protests demanding criminal-justice reform in 2020, he said, \"here we are four years later, and it's as if that conversation never happened.\" Frightened residents suddenly became less interested in hearing about root causes and long-term solutions, saying in community forums across the region that they felt unsafe and wanted something done now. Matthew Graves, the U.S. attorney for D.C., found himself suddenly being attacked as \"soft on crime,\" sometimes by the very same people who just months earlier were deriding him and other federal prosecutors as \"mass incarcerators.\" As soon as people start feeling unsafe, Graves told me, calls for reform are replaced by a desire to \"lock up as many people as possible for as long as possible.\" Evidence of this dizzying shift can be seen in the 2024 presidential election: Kamala Harris now embraces the prosecutor's background she attempted to distance herself from during the 2020 primary campaign.In 2014, the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, led to a wave of police reforms across the country. The killing of George Floyd intensified that wave. But as violent crime rose sharply across D.C. over the past few years, many of those reforms suddenly seemed ill-conceived. A new narrative took hold, even among frightened liberals: The city's progressivism had prompted a descent into lawlessness. Juvenile criminals were facing no consequences. Young people were out of control. Politicians backpedaled, prosecutors promised to get tough again, and police officers said smugly to one another, What did they think was going to happen?The D.C. city council's decision to trim the Metropolitan Police Department's budget in 2020 led to a hiring freeze that Peter Newsham, D.C.'s police chief from 2016 until early 2021, believes contributed to the spike in crime. \"If you look at our data during that time period, crime almost immediately went in the wrong direction, particularly violent crime,\" Newsham told me. \"To reduce the size of the police department was, in my opinion, irresponsible.\"Newsham doesn't dispute that policing needs to reform and evolve. But Washington's police department has been evolving for decades, he said, under the supervision of the U.S. Department of Justice. \"We're not the Derek Chauvins of the world,\" he told me, referring to the police officer who killed George Floyd.Newsham is now the police chief for nearby Prince William County, Virginia, which has been averaging only a dozen or so carjackings a year. He says that if you were to place a red dot on a map everywhere across the region where a serious crime has occurred, most of those dots would be concentrated in D.C. and some of its adjoining Maryland neighborhoods. \"As soon as you go into Virginia, there are very few red dots,\" he says. \"How do you explain that?\"He answered his own question: \"It's the lack of consequences in D.C. If you want to stop violent crime, you have to separate violent criminals from society. They're just not doing that. We're so concerned about the freedom of the violent offender that we're putting everyone else in jeopardy.\" (The poverty rate is also lower in Prince William County than in Washington.) Newsham says criminals in D.C. have told him they know not to commit a crime in Northern Virginia because they know punishment there \"is going to be swift and certain.\"The carjacking fever seems to finally be breaking; this is the first year since 2019 in which carjackings are down -- by more than 50 percent in D.C. and roughly 26 percent in Prince George's County through August. Police leaders attribute the decline in part to their specialized carjacking task forces, which have gotten better at solving cases -- and also to a public sentiment that has shifted back in favor of more aggressive policing and prosecution. Matthew Graves, the U.S. attorney, ascribes the decline in carjackings partly to his office's successful prosecution of multiple cases that resulted in lengthy prison sentences. Christina Henderson, the city-council member, concurs. \"I think the growing number of prosecutions has helped curb some of this behavior,\" she said.But Eduardo Ferrer, the policy director of the Juvenile Justice Initiative at the Georgetown University Law Center, says the panicked return to a draconian tough-on-crime approach is misguided. \"We're revisiting failed policies from the 1990s,\" such as youth curfews and longer pretrial detention, he told me. \"We're bringing back policies that we know did not work and that actually created a lot of harm.\"\"When crime rises, the reaction has always been to get tough on crime,\" Emily Gunston, who worked as first assistant attorney general for D.C. under Schwalb, told me. But \"all of the studies show that putting kids deeper in the juvenile justice system increases criminality rather than reducing it.\"Ferrer noted that it's a relatively small group of kids getting into trouble: Of the roughly 48,000 adolescents who live in D.C., fewer than 3 percent, or about 1,200, have been involved in the juvenile court system -- and of those, about 1 percent, or fewer than 500, are charged with the most violent crimes: homicide, armed robbery, and carjacking. Gunston thinks the focus should be on this subset of offenders. \"If we threw enough money and resources at these children,\" she told me, \"it would be much cheaper and more effective than what we're doing.\" Graves agrees that the most effective approach is to concentrate on the small number of people who are committing violent acts -- but that the initial emphasis should be on removing them from the community.Juvenile crime rates rise and fall, but the primary root causes of the crimes don't change, Ferrer said: Based on data from 2022, he estimates that 12 percent of the kids involved in D.C.'s juvenile justice system are homeless, 75 percent are on Medicaid, at least 45 percent have a diagnosed behavioral-health issue, and at least 50 percent have reported abuse or neglect. Many of these kids have experienced significant and complex trauma, and so have their parents. Problems that have compounded over generations will not be solved quickly.\"It's really important to hold two ideas in your brain at the same time,\" Gunston said. \"Carjacking is a terrible crime that has terrible effects on victims -- and these are children who don't have the same decision-making abilities as adults. A child who commits a crime like this has already been failed in so many ways.\"The concerns of a community worried about safety in the face of runaway violent crime are legitimate. So are concerns about the rights and life prospects of the sometimes quite young kids committing these crimes -- kids born into poverty and structural racism, many of whom were themselves victims before they became criminals. Can these concerns be balanced effectively? Ferrer said the solution is to address the root causes of crime and poverty. \"Real public safety is a by-product of thriving communities,\" he told me, and that's clearly true as far as it goes. But until we achieve that, would-be criminals, even young ones, have to know that they will face serious consequences for violent behavior. On this, police, prosecutors, criminologists, and most citizens in the afflicted communities agree. It should be possible to concentrate more intensive and proactive police work, and prosecutorial follow-through, on the small core of regular violent offenders, while at the same time investing public resources more broadly in impoverished neighborhoods. Brian Schwalb, the attorney general, calls this a \"both and\" approach: Violent offenders must face aggressive prosecution -- and communities must address root causes of crime. Rather than careening wildly from one extreme (defund the police) to the other (lock 'em up), Schwalb says the whole criminal-justice apparatus -- police and prosecutors and policy makers -- must constantly be calibrating minor adjustments in the balance between rehabilitation and punitiveness.Milele Drummond, who has taught in D.C. public schools for 14 years, has been struck recently by how casually some of her students talk about carjacking. \"To them, it's not a big deal,\" she told me. \"It's more fun to carjack\" than to be in school.Drummond, who lives in Southeast D.C., near the border with Maryland, worries about getting carjacked when she goes to get gas, especially when she has her two young children with her. But she also worries about her students. She had thought that teaching Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye would lead to productive discussions about racism. But she's found that an easier way to convey some of these lessons has been to talk about crime and justice in their own city. When crime is a thing that happens to other people elsewhere, she tells her classes, it's easy for people far from the scene to express empathy toward the perpetrator, and an understanding of why a person might have committed such a crime. But when people who are used to feeling safe suddenly don't, that empathy and understanding tend to evaporate quickly.Read: Why California is swinging right on crime\"When people of means and power and privilege start to feel afraid, everything changes,\" Drummond tells her students -- the response shifts very quickly from \"Oh, they have a sad story\" to \"Lock them up.\"In other words, when the threat of becoming a victim increases in their own neighborhoods, even progressive reformers are apt to suddenly become tough on crime. Which is what many of the law-abiding residents of higher-crime communities have been all along.It was now close to midnight. After chasing down the Escalade, the detectives had returned to the maze of gray cubicles on the second floor of their building. One wall was papered with flyers showing carjacked vehicles that had not been recovered. A discarded bumper with D.C. tags lay on the floor, retrieved from a carjacking scene.Josh Scall, another sergeant on the unit, walked in wearing a backwards baseball cap that read Girl Dad. He has two daughters, 6 and 8. During the car chase, his wife had been texting him, telling him that the girls, worn out from a swim meet, had gone to sleep easily.Scall looked over at a computer monitor on Dalton's desk, which was showing live feeds from each of the four interrogation rooms down the hall. Two young suspects, arrested in a different case, were yelling to each other through an air-conditioning vent.\"They're trying to charge me with armed robbery,\" one shouted.In a third room, the suspect whom the carjacking unit had apprehended that night sat in a chair, his head on a desk, his left wrist cuffed to a wall. Ueno, the gym rat, had gone in earlier to get the kid's name, and described him as respectful. \"He seemed defeated,\" he told the others. (They never found the second suspect.)After George Floyd's death, Scall, a 14-year police veteran, had questioned his choice of career. Scrolling Facebook, he'd see that everyone, including friends, had seemed to turn against his profession. But since joining the carjacking unit in 2021, he told me, he'd felt renewed purpose. His squad was doing unambiguous police work, with clear victims and villains. Every time he showed up at a scene, he'd been called there to help. He liked that. His wife thinks the job is too dangerous. But Scall feels that the unit is making a difference.Scall watched the detectives work. Cavanagh was typing up a probable-cause affidavit. Another detective retrieved a copy of the pursuit video from the helicopter hangar. A third followed the Escalade to the evidence bay for processing. Ueno hung up the phone and rolled his chair around to face the others. \"All right, the juvenile's grandmother has been notified,\" he said. She had not sounded surprised to hear that her grandson had been arrested.Just after midnight, Cavanagh walked over to the microwave to warm up a container of Irish stew. As the microwave beeped, her telephone rang. It was the owner of the Escalade. \"They ran from us and ended up losing control and hit a house,\" Cavanagh told him. \"So your car has some serious front-end damage.\"After Cavanagh hung up, she went back to the affidavit. She was charging the juvenile with 13 criminal counts, mostly felonies. In a little while, she'd drop him off at a youth detention center. With no prior arrests, he'd likely be released later that morning.",

    "content": "Gas prices were on the rise again on Monday as the national average price for a gallon of regular gas rose to $3.203. This was a slight increase from Sunday's price of $3.201.

    "title": "Illinois officials battle misinformation to protect integrity of November election",
    "content": "Complete coverage of the local and national primary and general election, including results, analysis and voter resources to keep Chicago voters informed.At the Sulzer Regional Library on a recent Wednesday night, an informational video and hands-on demonstration tried to ease voters' concerns with a blunt message: \"You can trust the voting machines.\"But the less than a dozen attendees, huddled in a semicircle around a voting machine, still had plenty of questions about what would come next on Election Day.They wondered: How are election judges vetted? Is there any way an election judge could sabotage somebody's vote? How protected are city servers from being hacked? Are governments like Russia and China accessing voting records?It was the first of three voting machine demonstrations the Chicago Board of Elections is hosting in the run-up to the Nov. 5 election, where election security is at the forefront of voters' minds.Russian influence and false claims of a rigged election plagued the last two presidential elections. This time, Illinois election officials said disinformation poses the biggest threat to the integrity of the vote.Bad actors both domestically and abroad \"re trying to get into the minds of voters, and they're trying to pit voters against each other,\" said Matt Dietrich, spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections.Through The Democracy Solutions Project, WBEZ, the Chicago Sun-Times and the University of Chicago's Center for Effective Government at the Harris School of Public Policy are examining the challenges to our democracy and potential solutions in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election.Illinois, a reliably blue state that has voted for the Democratic nominee in the last eight presidential elections, hasn't seen the same specters of conspiracy theories and allegations of fraud that have taken root in states like Arizona and Georgia.Case in point: A state-commissioned task force was created in 2022 to issue recommendations to combat foreign interference and cyberattacks in the run-up to the November election. It never even saw members appointed.Finding available experts who weren't already involved in similar efforts \"proved to be difficult,\" said John Patterson, spokesman for Illinois Senate President Don Harmon, and lawmakers didn't want to get in the way of the State Board of Elections' own security efforts.\"So the decision was made to shift gears and work directly with state elections officials and the Illinois Attorney General's office to identify issues and concerns as they pop up and address them through the legislative process,\" Patterson said in a statement, pointing to a recent state law that addressed publication of voters' personal information.In parts of the country, election authorities are adding bulletproof glass and panic buttons. Illinois officials say they're taking precautions -- though less extreme ones, from having Narcan on hand in case of fentanyl-laced suspicious packages to adding security officers for election sites and giving election workers more protections, like leaving their names off IDs. The FBI is investigating suspicious packages received by the Illinois State Board of Elections and officials across the country, although Chicago and Cook County said they had not received similar threats.\"We do have to prepare for the worst,\" Chicago Board of Elections spokesman Max Bever said. \"No matter what.\"In addition to election judges and poll watchers, over 400 polling place investigators, who are often off-duty or retired law enforcement, are hired for early voting and Election Day in Chicago, Bever said. The Cook County clerk's office has increased physical security for early voting sites, mail ballot deliveries and pickups and at the operations center and main office, said Edmund Michalowski, the Cook County deputy clerk of elections. Security will be provided through the Cook County Sheriff's Office and a private security firm.\"We doubled it for this 2024 November for two reasons,\" Michalowski said. \"One, that obviously the election is a really hot topic around the country. But also, it's going to probably be close to 70% turnout, so it's nice to have more people ... that we can make sure that we have enough people on site to take care of the needs of the voters.\"A new provision in state law went into effect in July that no longer requires election judges to have their name displayed on ID badges, in an attempt to shield workers from personal retribution, Dietrich said.Illinois voters will also be weighing whether to give election workers more protections through an advisory referendum on the November ballot. It asks whether candidates should be subject to civil penalties for attempting to interfere with an election worker's duties. State Rep. Jay Hoffman, who sponsored the legislation putting the question before voters, said that could encompass anything from threats to acts of violence against workers.\"It's one thing to allege fraud. It's another thing to threaten an election worker,\" Hoffman said. \"First of all, it's against every democratic principle we have ever, as a country, stood for. But secondly, it's going to have a chilling effect.\"Voting equipment is also getting more enhancements. Each of the more than 1,400 large metal cabinets which house voting equipment to be sent to each precinct across the suburbs is now equipped with a GPS tracking device, \"so we know exactly where it is,\" Michalowski said.After Russian hackers infiltrated Illinois' voter registration database in 2016, the Illinois State Board of Elections has created a division of information security, partnered with the Illinois National Guard to tap its cybersecurity experts and bolstered resources and training for election authorities throughout the state.At the voting demonstration, Bever ticked through the many layers of safeguards that are already in place.Each election machine undergoes tests. They are never connected to the internet. Officials keep a strict chain of custody, documenting each person who has inspected a machine. Voting equipment and ballots are secured and transported under video surveillance. Chicago has no drive-through drop boxes. Paper ballots are only printed by approved shops to ensure they meet specifications and can be read by scanners.\"Illinois is still an all-paper-ballot state, so no matter which way you vote, either on a touch screen or by paper ballot, there's always going to be a paper trail,\" Bever said. \"And that's important, because paper ballots can be reviewed for audits and recounts as necessary, and the voter can always review their choices on the ballots.\"But Bever called for more funding to safeguard ballots, arguing that it's getting more expensive to keep up with sophisticated threats.During the COVID-19 pandemic, West Ridge resident Mary Dudek witnessed misinformation around the coronavirus and vaccines unfold in real time at the federally qualified health center where she worked. It was staggering and disappointing, she said. Now she fears it's happening again -- this time with the election.\"I was shocked by how impacted we all were from that misinformation, and now I'm seeing that same kind of process unfolding again,\" Dudek said. \"So it's very worrisome.\"A recent poll by the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that a majority surveyed (78%) feel the spread of misinformation about the government is a major problem. Of those surveyed, 39% found it very or somewhat difficult to know if what candidates are saying is true or not.At the voting machine demonstration at Sulzer library, Dudek was hoping to learn more strategies to help the average person sift through the noise.\"It's just one thing after another. And if you are trying to stay on top of things, these are challenging times, because there's so much that is painful going on,\" she said.Nonpartisan voting groups and election authorities are launching new concerted efforts to help voters discern for themselves. The Illinois Attorney General's Office offers tips on how to spot artificially generated images. Public service announcements sponsored by the Illinois State Board of Elections are airing across hundreds of radio and television stations in Illinois; they encourage voters to turn to their election authorities for the most trusted info.\"We do not want to alienate them or create this 'us against you' environment where they feel like they're being insulted,\" Dietrich said, noting he avoids using terms like \"election denier.\" \"We want to get them back to where they always were before, where inherently, they trusted elections -- that elections in the United States are secure.\"The League of Women Voters of Illinois has marshaled its members to debunk common myths and teach media literacy through its new Mis/Disinformation Task Force. Its website features a toolkit and talks from experts on everything from protecting democracy in the age of social media and artificial intelligence to talking with people who disagree with you.\"If you argue with people, that doesn't work. What works is listening to them, asking questions, asking them to start questioning on their own,\" said Anne Sullivan, co-chair of the Mis/Disinformation Task Force.Barb Laimins, co-chair of the task force, has a new motto that is an old adage of journalists: If your mother says she loves you, check it out. If people have questions about election security, Laimins said there's no better way to get answers than signing up to work as an election judge.\"When you become an election judge, you become the perfect purveyor of accurate information and support of our election systems,\" Laimins said.",

    "title": "Revealed: Bundy collaborator fueled FEMA conspiracy in Hurricane Helene aftermath",
    "content": "Clockwise from upper right: Ammon Bundy, Ryan Bundy, Brian Cavalier, Shawna Cox, Pete Santilli, Jon Ritzheimer, Ryan Payne, Joe O'ShaughnessyOnly 30 minutes after billionaire Elon Musk began publicly accusing the federal government of blocking his company from delivering the satellite internet components to the disaster zone in western North Carolina, another extraordinary claim popped up on X.\"NC State Police issue statement that they will start arresting any federal employees trying to hinder rescue operations,\" an Arizona man named Joseph O'Shaughnessy wrote on X Oct. 4.Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, quickly disputed the claim from Musk, who owns both SpaceX and the social media platform X and would speak at Trump's rally in Butler, Pa. the following day. But O'Shaughnessy's claim piggy-backing off Musk's post added a new layer to manufactured intrigue: a potential clash between state and federal authorities in a region traumatized by the staggering loss.The statement is completely false, and it comes from someone with a history of armed confrontation with the FBI and other federal agencies. O'Shaughnessy served prison time for his role in the armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon in 2016 and was also charged in the standoff at Cliven Bundy's ranch in 2014.Prior to his involvement in the Bundy ranch standoff, O'Shaughnessy had been arrested for disorderly conduct, domestic violence and drugs, according to federal prosecutors.\"If you tie back to this guy, you'll see that nothing reliable comes from that guy,\" First Sgt. Christopher Knox, a public information officer for the N.C. State Highway Patrol, told Raw Story. \"That's not a trusted source of information. That information is not true in any way, shape or form.\"Knox pointed out that North Carolina doesn't even have an agency called \"NC State Police.\" The claim is even more dubious if one considers that State Highway Patrol in North Carolina is under the command of Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, an ally of Vice President Kamala Harris. From a purely partisan standpoint, it is unlikely the two agencies would end up in an adversarial position with one another.O'Shaughnessy responded to an inquiry from Raw Story by sending an AI-generated GIF of Trump dancing through a direct message on X.While O'Shaughnessy's post was quickly shot down by X users who pointed out that no such agency exists in North Carolina, it landed within a matrix of false claims by Trump allies that has created a mutually reinforced narrative, belied by the facts on the ground, that the federal government is abandoning the people of western North Carolina.O'Shaughnessy's post was reshared 18,000 times, including Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who has a long history of promoting conspiracy theories despite a professional background that requires an ability to separate fact from fantasy astutely.Before joining the Trump administration, Flynn held the highest military intelligence position as head of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, re-shared O'Shaughnessy's post, writing: \"Finally, some good news!\"Flynn, who has persistently used his X account to push apocalyptic messages about the impending breakup of the United States, has also pushed misinformation related to the disaster. During an Oct. 4 interview with right-wing influencer Benny Johnson, Flynn said there were \"reports\" about \"illegals\" raping children, while describing the flood-ravaged region as a \"warzone.\"Flynn also could not be reached for comment for this story.Johnson, who interviewed Flynn on his show, was recently employed by a media company alleged by federal prosecutors to be a front for a Russian influence operation. Johnson and other conservative influencers linked to the company have said they were victims of the scheme. During his interview with Flynn on Oct. 4, Johnson echoed many of the same themes as his guest during his opening monologue for the segment, claiming that the federal government has \"chosen\" immigrants over Trump supporters.\"Our federal government has left you to die in whatever small, inconsequential town that you come from because you are a Trump voter, because you support MAGA, because you are America first,\" he said.Flynn wasn't the only one who greeted O'Shaughnessy's bogus claim about a state law enforcement agency challenging the federal government.Gianna Miceli, who co-hosts a podcast that promotes sovereign citizen ideology, enthused: \"Now we have a jurisdiction war happening! What a great time for people to learn some lessons about who is the government and who is not.\"\"Exactly,\" O'Shaughnessy responded.In another reply to O'Shaughnessy's thread, Miceli falsely claimed: \"FEMA is a private for-profit corporation. It is not government.\"O'Shaughnessy's false claim that a state agency in North Carolina is threatening to arrest federal agents in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election fits a pattern with not only his involvement in the 2014 Bundy ranch standoff and 2016 Malheur occupation, but also the effort to overturn the 2020 election.Bundy ranch, Malheur occupation and Stop the Steal 2020O'Shaughnessy was described in a federal indictment in response to the Bundy ranch standoff as a \"mid-level leader and organizer of the conspiracy who, among other things: organized gunmen and other followers; led gunmen and other followers in the assault and extortion of federal law enforcement at the impound site; organized protection for members of the criminal enterprise; and organized armed patrols and security checkpoints.\"Similarly, federal prosecutors would later describe O'Shaughnessy as a \"mid-level organizer\" of the Malheur occupation. In a video interview during the occupation, according to the criminal complaint, O'Shaughnessy said: \"I'm right now in the process of trying to set up a constitutional security protection force to make sure these federal agents and these law enforcement don't just come in here like cowboys.\"O'Shaughnessy pleaded guilty to conspiracy to impede federal officers for his conduct during the Malheur occupation, but the government dismissed charges in the Bundy ranch case. O'Shaughnessy was sentenced to time served, and reportedly spent one year and nine months in custody for the two cases.O'Shaughnessy has described Roger Stone, a political consultant and longtime confidant of Trump, as a \"hero and a mentor.\" Like Flynn, Stone was pivotal in mobilizing a pressure campaign to overturn the 2020 election. Immediately following the 2020 election, Stone privately strategized with Flynn, the Washington Post reported.O'Shaughnessy's Instagram account shows that he was with Stone during a dinner in Florida with Stop the Steal organizer Ali Alexander in November 2020. Another post shows dated Dec. 11, 2020, the eve of the pro-Trump Jericho March rally in Washington, D.C. includes a photo that shows Stone drinking with InfoWars conspiracy trafficker Alex Jones.It is unclear what, if anything, O'Shaughnessy discussed with Stone, Jones and Alexander when they met on those two occasions.A false claim that evolved out of Elon Musk's dustup with FEMAIn his false post about state law enforcement threatening to arrest their counterparts last week, O'Shaughnessy appears to have taken a cue from Nick Sortor, a right-wing videographer who spent the past week in the Asheville area delivering Starlink terminals while producing media assailing the federal government response to the disaster.In an Oct. 3 X post, Sortor thanked Musk and SpaceX \"for bringing us another truckload of Starlinks. A photo in the post shows an officer wearing a North Carolina State Highway Patrol uniform holding a box labeled \"Starlink,\" while a video shows police vehicles that appear to be providing an escort for Sortor down a winding mountain road.The following day, Sortor replied to Musk's post accusing FEMA of preventing his engineers from allowing him to deliver supplies. In his reply, Sortor appears to reference the State Highway Patrol, while using the same misnomer that O'Shaughnessy would later use.\"Let me know where the blockades are and we'll have the NC State Police move them out of the way,\" Sortor wrote. \"Already did it once, which is one reason why we have an escort now. FEMA has zero jurisdiction.\"Trust me,\" he added. \"They're not going to win this one.\"Twenty-four minutes later, O'Shaughnessy made his post claiming that the \"NC State Police\" were prepared to start arresting federal agents.Challenged to substantiate his claim, O'Shaughnessy responded to one detractor by writing, \"Calm down stranger danger, my boys were one of the 1 on-scene to bring aid.... I am the source.\"O'Shaughnessy didn't identify his \"boys\" on the ground in North Carolina, but on Sunday he praised Sortor for delivering the Starlink terminals, writing, \"And everyone, please follow @nicksortor. He's the one who made it happen.\"Manufacturing a fake turf war between FEMA and state law enforcement doesn't help the residents of western North Carolina, Christopher Knox, the State Highway Patrol spokesperson, told Raw Story. Instead of relying on dubious accounts on X, Knox recommended that people seek information about the recovery effort from trusted sources such as the NC Department of Public Safety.\"There's a lot of people hurting and a lot of people looking for resources,\" Knox said. \"We hate that there's stuff out there slowing the response. Getting people to the right sources is a big goal of the state of North Carolina.\"",

    "title": "Trump and Harris Have Vastly Different Plans for Public Education",
    "content": "This article is part of a series on what the 2024 presidential election means for science, health and the environment. Editors with expertise on each topic delved into the candidates' records and policies and the evidence behind them. Read the rest of the stories here.Education in the U.S. is in a state of flux. The pandemic has left students across the country with learning gaps, especially in math and science. Teacher turnover is high, with some areas hit by staffing shortages. Schools are increasingly targeted in mass shootings and effectively segregated by race. Public schools face budget cuts and declining enrollment, while states across the country are allowing taxpayer dollars to fund private education instead.The two current presidential candidates propose two sharply different paths forward for the U.S. education system. Former president Donald Trump favors what's known as school choice, or privatization, and increasing government involvement in curriculum. Vice President Kamala Harris supports programs to address inequity across early childhood, K-12 and higher education. Here's how their policy proposals measure up.If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.Trump's most eye-catching campaign promise has been to eliminate the Department of Education. \"We will drain the government education swamp and stop the abuse of your taxpayer dollars to indoctrinate America's youth with all sorts of things that you don't want to have our youth hearing,\" he said at a September rally in Wisconsin.Eliminating the agency, which provides around 11 percent of public school funding nationwide, would require an act of Congress. Even if this were to happen, the Trump campaign has not clarified what it proposes to do with the Department's two biggest programs -- Title I and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) -- which collectively provide some $34 billion in funding to educate students from low-income families and those with disabilities, respectively. But Project 2025, a recently published conservative policy agenda that has many connections to Trump but is not formally associated with his campaign, proposes sending federal funding for Title I and IDEA to states as no-strings-attached block grants -- meaning states could use the funds however they choose. The project also calls for phasing out federal spending on Title I funding over a 10-year period.Upending Title I funding \"would have a very substantial effect on districts that have higher concentrations of poverty,\" says Mark Weber, a public school teacher and education policy analyst at the New Jersey Policy Perspective think tank.\"A big concern for me  that the kids who are already poorly served will fall further behind because there won't be anything that requires states\" to use the funding equitably, says Gloria Ladson-Billings, a professor emerita of education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.In her speech at the Democratic National Convention, Harris opposed Trump's plan to close the Department of Education. Her platform proposes calling on Congress to triple Title I funding, and to fully fund IDEA to give schools the resources to educate disabled students. On the campaign trail, she has mainly focused on affordability measures for early childhood and higher education. Harris has promised to continue the Biden-Harris administration's push for universal preschool, which has repeatedly stalled in Congress. She has also promised to build on the Biden-Harris administration's programs to forgive student debt. The administration has so far approved nearly $170 billion in student loan forgiveness for almost five million borrowers, but Harris has not made any specific promises about what future student debt relief would look like.Trump opposes student loan forgiveness, and during his first term he attempted to end the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, which forgives student debt after 10 years of repayment for eligible professionals including teachers and nurses. Project 2025 calls for eliminating PSLF and other repayment-based forgiveness options.The cornerstone of Trump's education policy is school choice, also known as school privatization. States are increasingly using public dollars to fund private education through programs such as vouchers and Education Savings Accounts (ESAs), both of which give parents public money for private school tuition. These programs reduce the amount of funding available for public school budgets. Since the start of the pandemic, many states have enacted school choice programs; 19 school choice bills were enacted across 17 states in 2023, and 17 bills have been enacted so far in 2024.Trump has long supported school privatization. During his first term, he appointed school choice advocate Betsy DeVos as the Secretary of Education. And two Supreme Court cases, decided in part by Trump's three nominees to the court, recently increased the flow of public funding to private schools by requiring voucher programs to include religious schools.\"At this point, the only way to ensure that vouchers do not fund religious education in a state is to not have vouchers at all,\" says Bryan Mann, an education researcher at the University of Kansas.Harris's platform opposes voucher programs and the use of public funds to pay for religious education. Last year her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz (himself a former public school teacher) criticized Iowa's school choice program. \" we end up doing is subsidizing folks who are already attending private, religious schools ... or homeschooling. And it leaves our teachers ... in the short,\" he said in an interview with the political news outlet Iowa Starting Line.Research has shown that voucher programs do not improve student achievement and can even hamper it. \"School choice does produce positive feelings among parents who value the choice of alternative educational possibilities for their kids, but the vast literature on vouchers shows little or no positive impact on students' learning,\" says Martin Carnoy, a labor economist at Stanford University, who specializes in education. More recent, larger-scale voucher programs in Indiana and Louisiana have shown negative effects on achievement. \"If anything,  seem to result in attracting students to private schools where the students score lower than in the public schools they left,\" Carnoy says.\"Over and over again, we are seeing in large-scale studies that large-scale school voucher programs have really profoundly negative effects on student achievement,\" Weber says. They also allow for discrimination since unlike public schools, private schools are not required to meet every student's needs. They are allowed to turn away disabled students and students learning English, and in some cases have discriminated against LGBTQ+ students.\"From my perspective, this is all very insidious,\" Elizabeth DeBray, an education policy researcher at the University of Georgia, says of these state-level voucher programs. \"It's not a sign of a state headed toward a healthy public education system.\"Trump vocally opposes federal involvement in education, but he also paradoxically promises to use the power of the White House to determine what schools are allowed to teach. His platform includes threatening schools and educators with civil rights investigations and funding cuts if they teach topics related to structural racism and LGBTQ+ identities. He also supports teaching the Christian religion in classrooms, and he emphatically endorsed Louisiana's new law requiring public schools to display the Ten Commandments in every classroom.The number of books banned in public schools nearly tripled in the 2023-2024 school year compared with the previous year, according to recent data from PEN America, and states continue to pass \"gag order\" laws restricting what teachers can say about gender, sexuality and race. Harris called out these restrictions while speaking at the convention of the American Federation of Teachers, one of the two teachers' unions that have endorsed her. \"While you teach students about our nation's past, these extremists attack the freedom to learn and acknowledge our nation's true and full history,\" she said at the meeting.These restrictions have placed educators across the country in a difficult position, Ladson-Billings says. \"For them to be at the mercy of these political operatives is frightening,\" she adds.Overall, DeBray sees two big questions at stake in the November 5 election. First, closing the Department of Education would cause substantive harm by fragmenting policy and symbolic harm by devaluing the importance of education, she says. And second, following the height of the COVID pandemic, voters and politicians face a choice between reinvesting in public schools that serve every child -- or pulling away from them.\"There are a lot of forces that have concluded in the aftermath of the pandemic that the challenges are too great, the gaps are too wide\" in public schools and that privatization is the way forward, she says. But for her part, she advocates reinvestment: \"Strengthen funding for public schools. Recommit to them as an institution because they're so key to our democracy.\"",

    "content": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has criticized the makers of the biopic The Apprentice after rumors resurfaced that he violently sexually abused his ex-wife Ivana.The film, starring Sebastian Stan as Trump and Jeremy Strong as Republican operative Roy Cohn, features a stomach-churning scene in which Trump throws Ivana, his first wife, to the ground and sexually assaults her as she screams for him to stop.While the scene has already sparked controversy, Trump today broke his silence on the film, which was released in the US on Friday, claiming that he and his ex-wife, who died in 2022, had a \"great relationship... until the day that she died.'He wrote on Truth Social: 'A fake and classless movie written about me called The Apprentice (Do they even have the right to use that name without permission?) will hopefully 'bomb'.\"It's a cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job, laid out just before the 2024 presidential election, to try to hurt the greatest political movement in our country's history: 'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!'\"My ex-wife, Ivana, was a kind and wonderful person, and I had a wonderful relationship with her until the day she died. The author of this pile of garbage, Gabe Sherman, a lowlife and talentless hack who has long been widely discredited, knew that, but chose to ignore it.Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump (pictured, right) has criticized the makers of the biopic The Apprentice after reports resurfaced that he violently sexually abused his ex-wife Ivana (pictured, left).The films star Maria Bakalova as Ivana Trump (photo, left) and Sebastian Stan as Donald Trump (photo, right)\"So sad that HUMAN STUFF, like the people involved in this hopefully failed venture, are allowed to say and do whatever they want to harm a political movement much bigger than us.\"The scene in The Apprentice is taken from a court deposition Ivana made during her divorce from Trump in 1990, which she later recanted in 2015 during his first presidential campaign.According to Harry Hurt III, a journalist covering the case said Trump was furious that a \"scalp reduction\" he had requested to get rid of a bald spot was painful.Enraged at Ivana for recommending the surgeon, Trump, according to Hurt, pulled out a handful of his wife's hair and began sexually assaulting her.The next morning he asked her menacingly, \"Does it hurt?\"According to the film writer Gabriel Sherman: 'the scene she described in the divorce papers was actually much more graphic and brutal than the scene we dramatized in the film.\"Both Trump and the film's financier Dan Snyder, a close friend of the Republican candidate, unsuccessfully filed cease-and-desist letters to get the film canned.Snyder financed the film expecting it to portray Trump positively.But the pair may not have to worry about anyone even seeing the film, given its disappointing box office performance during its opening weekend.Sebastian Stan (left) stars as the businessman turned politician, while Jeremy Strong plays his lawyer Roy Cohn and Maria Bakalova (right) plays Trump's ex-wife IvanaDonald Trump's biopic The Apprentice has received mostly positive reviews from critics who have praised it as an \"upbeat\" and fast-paced story with strong performances.Ivana (photo, left) was married to Donald Trump (photo, right) from 1977 to 1990Republican presidential candidate, former President Donald Trump, gestures during a campaign rally at the Findlay Toyota Arena on Sunday, October 13, 2024It only earned $1.58 million, despite a $16 million production budget and a release in 1,750 theaters.The opening day results were especially disappointing, with the film grossing about $150,000 on Thursday.Despite these challenges, the film, starring Sebastian Stan as Trump and Jeremy Strong as Republican operative Roy Cohn, has received mostly positive reviews.Meanwhile, production company Briarcliff Entertainment is reportedly aiming to have the film considered for awards.In a largely positive review, The New York Times called the film \"cheerfully vulgar\" and said there was a \"surprising\" resemblance between the leads Sebastian and Jeremy and the real men they portray.Reviewer Manohla Dargis wrote, \"Each actor has clearly made a careful study of his character's real-life counterpart, his mannerisms, how he moves and especially his voice.\"She added: \"The film encourages you to laugh at its extremes, its vanity and boastfulness.

    "title": "Your guide to the presidential candidates' views on abortion",
    "content": "Abortion rights became an electoral tinderbox in 2022 after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.Abortion rights, always a polarizing issue in American politics, became an electoral tinderbox in 2022 after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision to create a federal right to abortion access. Democrats have seized upon the issue of women's bodily autonomy, notably in the 2024 presidential election, in part because it could motivate the critical bloc of suburban women voters in swing states.The prospect of women not having access to abortion was theoretical in many voters' minds until the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which set in motion a domino effect of widely varying laws about abortion in the states. As of June, 14 states had enacted total bans on the medical procedure, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research organization that supports abortion access.Other states have enacted restrictions at various stages in pregnancy. The end result of all of the laws is many American women traveling to receive reproductive care, more than 171,000 in 2023, according to the institute. ProPublica reported on Sept. 16 that two Georgia women died after being unable to access legal abortion and timely medical care there, including a 28-year-old single mother who traveled to another state to obtain a prescription for a medical abortion, but then had rare complications because the fetal tissue was not fully expelled from her body.Care that is routinely provided in such situations was significantly delayed, resulting in Amber Nicole Thurman getting a sepsis infection that caused her blood pressure to plummet and her organs to fail, according to the ProPublica report. Twenty hours later, after doctors decided to operate, her heart stopped. A state committee focused on pregnancy-related fatalities concluded that her death was \"preventable.\"Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris weighed in the day after the report was published, saying that such tragedies are the direct result of former President Trump's Supreme Court appointees who voted to strike down Roe.\"This young mother should be alive, raising her son, and pursuing her dream of attending nursing school,\" the vice president said in a statement. \"In more than 20 states, Trump Abortion Bans are preventing doctors from providing basic medical care. Women are bleeding out in parking lots, turned away from emergency rooms, losing their ability to ever have children again. Survivors of rape and incest are being told they cannot make decisions about what happens next to their bodies. And now women are dying. These are the consequences of Donald Trump's actions.\"There have also been multiple reports of woman suffering miscarriages and other medical emergencies who struggled to get care.Republicans, including Trump, have claimed that Harris and running mate Tim Walz support allowing babies to be killed after they are born. Trump repeated that false assertion during the September presidential debate.\"It's an execution,\" Trump said, claiming that Democrats support allowing babies to be killed in the final months of pregnancy and after they are born.It is illegal to kill babies after they are born in every state, and extremely rare late-term abortions typically occur because the baby's health is severely compromised and the baby is not viable, or because of threats to the health of the woman.Abortions after 21 weeks, considered late-term pregnancies, account for less than 1% of abortions, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 80% of abortions occur in the first nine weeks of pregnancy, and 6% occur during the second trimester.In the aftermath of the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, questions immediately arose about whether Congress would enact legislation protecting abortion access across the nation or a federal measure prohibiting such rights.Trump has vacillated on whether or not he would sign a federal abortion ban, but he has said that he would support a federal prohibition after a certain length of pregnancy. The former president has also stated that Americans broadly support the issue being decided by the states, which is decisively refuted by all reliable public polling.\"Look, this is an issue that's torn our country apart for 52 years,\" Trump said during the debate. \"Every legal scholar, every Democrat, every Republican ... they all wanted this issue to be brought back to the states where the people could vote, and that's what happened.\"Each individual state is voting. It's the vote of the people,\" Trump said.Harris argues that Trump is untrustworthy on the issue, and she vocally supports federal legislation allowing abortions until a fetus could survive outside the uterus, and later if required for medical reasons. The first White House official to visit an abortion clinic, Harris has called Trump's actions on abortion \"unconscionable.\"\"It's insulting to the women of America,\" Harris said. \"Understand what has been happening under Donald Trump's abortion bans. Couples who pray and dream of having a family are being denied IVF treatments. What is happening in our country, working people, working women who are working one or two jobs who can barely afford child care as it is, have to travel to another state, to get on a plane, sitting next to strangers to go and get the healthcare she needs.\"A president's power to reshape the Supreme Court took on greater importance when Trump narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016. Senate Republicans refused to even consider President Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to fill the seat of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia after Scalia died in February 2016 -- nine months before the election.That set the stage for Trump to fill Scalia's seat and two others -- the last of his picks, Amy Coney Barrett, was confirmed just a week before the 2020 election -- paving the path to Roe being overturned, which the former president frequently boasts about.\"Now it's not tied up in the federal government,\" Trump said. \"I did a great service in doing it. It took courage to do it, and the Supreme Court had great courage in doing it, and I give tremendous credit to those six justices\" who voted to overturn the landmark abortion ruling.Harris has lashed out at Trump for appointing the justices who supported overturning federal protection for abortion rights.\"Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade -- and they did exactly as he intended,\" she said.",

Shop now and get 10% off with code RB10. Vet & LEO-founded.Trump emphasized that the decision was unanimous, describing it as \"thousands of people\" coming together in support.Paul Perez, the president of the National Border Patrol Council, joined Trump on stage to address the crowd.Perez delivered a strong message, warning of the consequences if Kamala Harris wins the 2024 election. \"If we allow border czar Harris to win this election, every city, every community in this great country is going to go to hell,\" Perez said, citing the influx of unvetted individuals who have entered the country, leading to increased crime rates including \"murders, rapes, robberies, and burglaries.\"Perez voiced his support for Trump as the only candidate capable of resolving the border crisis. \"Only one man can fix that. That is Donald J. Trump,\" he told the crowd, adding that Trump has consistently stood by the men and women protecting the border and risking their lives for the country.Perez also emphasized the stark choice voters face in November: either allow the chaos to continue at the southern border with criminal cartels controlling drug and human trafficking, or vote to restore order.He highlighted the threat posed by the smuggling of drugs, particularly fentanyl, which has devastated communities across the nation.\"On behalf of the 16,000 men and women represented by the National Border Patrol Council, we strongly support and endorse Donald J. Trump for President of the United States,\" Perez declared, signaling the union's firm backing for Trump.Following the endorsement, Trump expressed his appreciation for the council, calling them an \"incredible group of people\" and reiterating his commitment to supporting the agents who protect the U.S. border.As Trump continues to campaign for votes in key battleground states, he took the opportunity at the rally to criticize Kamala Harris and vowed never to allow the U.S. military to become \"woke.\" During the event, Trump also showed a clip from the film Full Metal Jacket on a screen behind him, featuring R. Lee Ermey's drill sergeant character, before humorously transitioning into a mock \"pride month\" announcement.In addition to addressing border security, Trump promised to prioritize reducing violent crime and supporting law enforcement if elected.The rally in Arizona, a critical swing state, is part of Trump's broader effort to galvanize voters ahead of the November 2024 election.According to a recent poll conducted by the Wall Street Journal, the race between Trump and Harris remains extremely close in several key battleground states.The survey, conducted between September 28 and October 8, found that Trump and Harris are tied in North Carolina and Wisconsin, while Harris holds slight leads in Arizona and Georgia.Trump's biggest advantage is in Nevada, where he leads Harris 49% to 43%. Pennsylvania also remains close, with Trump leading 47% to 46%.Voters in the poll indicated they trust Trump more when it comes to handling the economy, inflation, and border security.As the election nears, both candidates are expected to intensify their efforts to win over voters in these key states.The opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of Objectivist.

    "title": "The age factor election: \"A vote for Trump could easily be a vote for a President Vance\"",
    "content": "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is greeted by running mate Senator J.D. Vance on stage during a campaign rally inside the Herb Brooks National Hockey Center at St. Cloud State University in St. Cloud, Minnesota, on July 27, 2024. (Tom Brenner for The Washington Post via Getty Images)With less than a month to go until Election Day, the American people and the world will soon find out if the epic that is the Age of Trump is about to be over or if they will be forced to suffer through a sequel featuring the various characters and spin-offs that the MAGAverse 2.0 may spawn. In these final weeks, the story that is the Age of Trump most closely resembles some type of crime novel, one in which the crimes are announced and planned in public and then committed in plain sight.Donald Trump is amplifying the Big Lie 2.0 as he primes his MAGA followers to preemptively reject the results of the 2024 election and to engage in acts of civil unrest and violence. Trump and the MAGAfied Republican Party are also attempting to recruit tens of thousands of \"poll watchers\" to stop virtually non-existent \"voter fraud\", i.e. to intimidate Black and brown voters. On the state and local level, through legal, extra-legal, and illegal means Trump's agents and other MAGA supporters are also attempting to infiltrate, manipulate or through acts of outright fraud to steal the 2024 election on his behalf. As Reuters recently highlighted, this danger is especially acute in the key battleground states. Georgia is one such battleground state where a small group of local Trump election deniers are in key positions to overturn the results of the 2024 presidential election. And as they did in 2020, Trump's agents and allies are already preparing to flood the courts with specious lawsuits to stop Kamala Harris from assuming office if she wins the 2024 election.America's democracy crisis is global. Donald Trump's campaign is being supported by hostile foreign actors such as Russia who are engaging in a sophisticated propaganda disinformation psyops campaign online, via social media and across the wider right-wing media space with the goal of weakening America's democracy at home and the country's influence and power abroad. One of Trump's main propaganda points is that America is imperiled by an \"enemy within.\" This appears to be an act of projection. Bob Woodward reports in his new book that Trump appears to be beholden to Vladimir Putin - and has acted in service to that loyalty in ways that have imperiled the collective safety and well-being of the American people.The choice between Kamala Harris, a responsible leader and defender of American democracy, and Donald Trump, a demonstrated enemy of democracy and the nation's interests, who has promised to be a dictator on \"day one\" of his \"presidency,\" should not be easier or clearer. Nonetheless, public opinion polls continue to show that the 2024 election is one of the closest in modern American history. A new poll by the New York Times and Siena shows that an increasing number of Americans view the vice president as representing a force for positive change (Harris leads Trump by 2 points on this question). These findings complement other polls that show Harris with momentum and leading Trump in the national vote (again by relatively small percentages that tend to be within the margin of error). While approximately half the voters want the book and story that is the Age of Trump to be over and done with there are likely just as many who want many more stories and more time with their favorite character, Donald Trump.In an attempt to make better sense of this unprecedented and truly historic election, where we are as a nation, and what may happen next, I recently spoke to a range of experts.Norm Ornstein is emeritus scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and co-author of the bestselling book \"One Nation After Trump: A Guide for the Perplexed, the Disillusioned, the Desperate, and the Not-Yet Deported.\"I am nervous. No matter how many disgraceful things Trump does and says, his support is stable. His floor is probably 45% and the ceiling is maybe 47%. That could well be enough to win the requisite electoral votes. Combine that with the voter suppression, voter intimidation and chicanery by his MAGA allies in key states and it makes me nervous. I believe Harris is ahead and should win. But....I am encouraged by the Harris campaign, which moved into professional high gear without a hitch when Biden withdrew, and she, and  Walz, have run a strong campaign. Trump has clearly deteriorated and, as the Times pointed out, turned not just more incoherent but much darker. By all rights, his authoritarian, mean, lying and threatening rhetoric should have disqualified him from any office or position of trust. That it has not is truly troubling.In these remaining weeks, I am worrying about more October surprises, including more hurricanes and the possible widening of war in the Middle East. And maybe even Supreme Court rulings. I fear Trump will grow more desperate, knowing if he loses, jail could be in the offing. Who knows what Trump is capable of doing?If Kamala Harris wins, the key question is what happens with the House and Senate -- especially the Senate. If it goes to the Republicans, we will have a rough couple of years, with executive and judicial confirmations facing rocky roads -- and a radical right Supreme Court that will do its best to cripple executive action, its immunity decision notwithstanding. If, somehow, Democrats win the trifecta, the critical question will be whether there are 50 votes in the Senate to change the rules to allow some key policies -- reinstating Roe, passing democracy reforms, sensible gun reforms -- to pass ultimately with simple majority votes.If Trump wins, expect his pledges to invoke the Insurrection Act, provoke political violence, focus on retribution, pardon the January 6 criminals, blow up our alliances and form a new one with dictators. Expect an administration run by thugs like Stephen Miller, Steve Bannon, Michael Flynn, Ric Grenell and Roger Stone.Matthew Dallek, a political historian at George Washington University, is the author, most recently, of \"Birchers: How the John Birch Society Radicalized the American Right.\"Why has the presidential campaign remained a razor-thin contest since Vice President Kamala Harris became the de facto Democratic Party's nominee? First, some voters seem to be willing to overlook Trump's manifest unfitness for office. Much of the public believes that Trump has no morals, revels in the dehumanization of minority groups and tramples on the rule of law -- but many voters also have concluded that he, more than Harris, is able to promote people's economic security, which is one reason why he has remained so competitive.Second, this tight campaign -- Kamala Harris should be winning by a landslide given Trump's status as a felon and an insurrectionist -- reflects the metastasizing belief that the United States is broken, a system beset by unfixable ailments. Rather than an economy producing opportunity for all, and a politics organized to address the public's most urgent problems and concerns, many Americans have become jaundiced and cynical. Interviews with swing voters conducted by major news outlets reveal their disquiet: their belief that whoever prevails this November will not improve their lives and that Washington, D.C. is corrupt and inept. Neither Trump nor Harris, these undecided voters seem to be saying, will help them afford college, childcare, home ownership and health care. The public's dyspepsia helps explain Trump's political viability; his brand promises to destroy a rigged system and Americans' rage and cynicism act as fuel to his campaign.This year's election is fraught. It puts the United States at an inflection point echoing some of the most destabilizing developments of the 21st century -- nine-eleven, the Great Recession, Trump's 2016 victory, the pandemic, January 6. Not since the late 1960s and early 1970s has the country experienced such a spate of political violence. If Trump were to lose, it's virtually impossible to envision him accepting the election results; he is likely to accuse his enemies of stealing the election and urge his most passionate followers to take to the streets.If Trump prevails in November, however, the nation would likely be plunged into a different kind of chaos. A Trump victory would sow a crisis of democratic legitimacy and the nation would probably enter a period of prolonged instability. Trump seems poised to move with speed to advance his autocratic, isolationist, nativist, anti-rule-of-law agenda. As president, he would escape accountability for his alleged and proven criminal conduct. A Trump presidency would strain the nation's judiciary, election system, Department of Justice and international alliances. Put differently, the nonstop traumatic impact of the Trump years is unlikely to end on Election Day and the next few months pose the latest in a string of stresses on the nation's democratic resiliency.Hal Brown is a clinical social worker and was one of the first members of the Duty to Warn group. He has extensive expertise in working with multiple personality disorder (now called dissociative identity disorder).As Election Day approaches, I am experiencing mixed emotions. I am feeling run-of-the-mill trepidation to off-the-charts trepidation. I am not debilitated because my partner and close friends are here to support each other and because I write a political blog.I always anticipated that the election was going to be down to the wire, but nobody could have guessed that Trump would have had two people attempt to assassinate him. These events played right into his narrative as being some kind of Heaven-sent heroic savior.As a retired psychotherapist who is always balancing looking inward and looking outward, I weigh worst-case scenarios. I do with myself what I would have done with my clients who would be living in terror over the prospect of a Trump win. In my inner life I know I will hold my friends close and my loved ones closer. In my outer life, I will make a plan for myself to join the resistance against a Trump regime in whichever ways I feel I can be the most effective.Want a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.As the election approaches, I think we will see, excuse the cliche, more of Trump being Trump. I also think we will see an increase in his cognitive decline, which I hope against hope is covered in the mainstream media. The public must be reminded that while the vice president is the only member of the Executive Branch who can't be fired, the president can essentially be fired by the vice president should he become significantly impaired. This is accomplished through the 25th Amendment. People must realize that a vote for Trump could easily be a vote for a President Vance.If Harris wins life will go on for me. I will breathe a sigh of relief once she is sworn in. I will probably be hard-pressed to find subjects to write my blog about. I can't say much more than if Trump wins my life will go on even as he bends the country towards a nationalistic brutal authoritarianism. I know that because of my living circumstances here in liberal Oregon, my life won't change that much. I will, however, see draconian changes in other parts of the country. How quickly and how harshly these will be implemented can't be predicted. Neither can the blowback coming from Democracy loving protesters. Like others, I think violence is a very real possibility.I want to share some advice, and hopefully some wisdom, from my 40 years as a psychotherapist and from the insights I gained from both my own clients and from my own therapists. In addition to what I said above, I would remind everyone who feels overwhelmed that no matter how horrific things get you are not alone in the resistance. The most insidious feeling during times of stress is loneliness. If you feel this and want to hide your head under a blanket force yourself to rally whatever strength you can muster and reach out to like-minded people.David Pepper is a lawyer, writer, political activist and former elected official. His new book is \"Saving Democracy: A User's Manual for Every American.\"I am feeling disturbed. The scale of disinformation dominating the country is foreboding about the politics of the future. And the normalization of far-right extremism (in the form of JD Vance) is very dangerous. In the end, while Trump is the central focus of this election, the broader extremism of the anti-democracy right is on the ballot on many levels -- along with truly dark tactics on how they advance that agenda. The bottom line: even if Trump loses, this election makes clear the long-term challenges we face go far beyond this particular cycle.In the weeks until Election Day, I expect more October surprises. More lies. Attempts at suppression. Outside interference. Election denialism. We are seeing the extent people are willing to go to secure power.If Donald Trump wins, every promise he and JD Vance have made -- and everything written in Project 2025 -- become fair game for them to fulfill beginning next year. From privatizing weather forecasts to attacks on public education, unions and workers, to bans on abortion and IVF, everyday Americans will quickly see how long-sought right-wing priorities will quickly upend their own lives, their communities and the nation as a whole.",

    "content": "JAKARTA, KOMPAS.com - Only 8 more days of government President Joko Widodo will end and will be replaced by President-elect Prabowo Subianto.During his 10 years in office, in addition to achieving a number of successes in the infrastructure and economic sectors, Jokowi was also known to be very skillful in implementing his political strategies.There are always two sides that emerge as a result of political measures. Some sneered, were dissatisfied and felt wronged. Meanwhile, there were also those who appreciated and praised him because they felt they had benefited from him.Also read: Transformation of the Jokowi-Prabowo rivalry and continuing political polarizationThis description is at least an illustration of the attitude of the two political parties (political parties) who feel the implications of Jokowi's political moves, namely the PDI-P and the Democratic Party.The PDI-P is the political party that led Jokowi to become Mayor of Solo in 2005, Governor of DKI Jakarta in 2012, and President of the Republic of Indonesia in 2014.The friendship that existed for almost 20 years then ended due to differences in attitude between the PDI-P and Jokowi during the 2024 presidential election (Pilpres).The reason is that the bull party feels abandoned by Jokowi, who prefers number 2 presidential and vice-presidential candidate Prabowo and Gibran Rakabuming Raka, his eldest son.In fact, the PDI-P had its own champions at that time, namely Ganjar Pranowo and Mahfud MD who were the number 3 presidential and vice-presidential candidates.Also read: Jokowi's sarcasm, Megawati: Never mind, I want to finish, just finish...Politician PDI-P Chico Hakim said that the status of PDI-P cadres is not only linked to their membership card (KTA) but also to their loyalty to the party.Thus, he stressed, the difference in the political steps taken by Jokowi and his children and son-in-law in the PDI-P shows that the status of these cadres is no longer inherent.\"Because Pak Jokowi chose to be there with his son and son-in-law, that's good, let's do what's best for this nation in the future. \"We are thinking about how to build the nation together, although of course we don't need to be together in a coalition,\" he said on the Sapa Indonesia Pagi Kompas TV show, April 26, 2024.The division between the PDI-P and Jokowi became even more evident when the bull party did not invite him to the 5th PDI-P National Working Meeting (Rakernas) held on May 24-26, 2024.At that time, PDI-P Secretary General (Sekjen) Hasto Kristiyanto revealed that the PDI-P only invited parties that had the enthusiasm to maintain democracy and law in the country.Also read: Jokowi, Prabowo, Gibran meet solo, Gerindra: discuss the inaugurationJokowi himself has often received harsh criticism from the PDI-P after the Constitutional Court (MK) decision number 90/PUU-XXI/2023 regarding the age limit for presidential and presidential candidates. vice presidency, which declared Gibran eligible to participate in the 2024 presidential election.",

    "title": "5 big analyst AI moves: Microsoft, Amazon rating cuts; Robotaxi day disappoints",
    "content": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!Oppenheimer analysts downgraded Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock from Outperform to Perform on Tuesday, citing concerns about elevated consensus expectations for both revenue and earnings.A key issue raised by the firm's analysts is potential losses stemming from Microsoft's AI partner, OpenAI, which is expected to post a loss of around $5 billion this year. With Microsoft holding a 49% stake, the company could face significant financial impact as a result.The downgrade also highlighted slower-than-expected enterprise adoption of AI technologies, which could lead to lower-than-anticipated revenue from AI-related services.In addition, Oppenheimer pointed to rising capital expenditures (CapEx), particularly in high-performance computing, such as GPUs and data centers. The firm estimates that Microsoft's CapEx will hit $63 billion by 2025, a 14% year-over-year increase and double what it spent in 2023. Depreciation is also expected to rise by 28%, reaching $29 billion.The analysts mentioned that the Federal Reserve's 50 basis point interest rate cut in September, will likely have a modest effect on Microsoft's net interest income from its $76 billion cash reserve.Oppenheimer also expressed concerns over Microsoft's gross and EBITDA margins, which are expected to decline due to rising depreciation and operational costs linked to AI investments.\"This will translate into 3% EPS growth in 1Q25 and we expect weakish guidance for 2025. We also think the Street estimates for EPS growth are ~200bps too high in FY26 and FY27,\" analysts said in a note.Further risks include potential bottlenecks in data center capacity to meet anticipated GPU shipments and growing competition in the AI space, with other companies narrowing the gap on Microsoft.Microsoft's stock currently trades in the middle of its five-year price-to-earnings range of 25x-35x, though Oppenheimer suggests it could drift toward the lower end of that spectrum.Goldman Sachs raised its price target for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to $150 from $135 on Friday, reflecting an 11% potential upside.Following a recent investor meeting with Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang, CFO Colette Kress, and IR representative Stewart Stecker, Goldman Sachs analysts expressed stronger confidence in Nvidia's competitive positioning, particularly as inference workloads become more complex.\"We came away from the NDR with a better appreciation of the company's competitive moat and, importantly, the projected increase in Inference workload complexity as well as its implications for future compute demand,\" the bank noted.Goldman Sachs highlighted several factors underpinning Nvidia's competitive advantage, including its large installed base, innovation at both the chip and data center levels, and its expanding software offerings.The report specifically mentioned domain-specific libraries like Nvidia Parabricks, used for genomics analysis, and Nvidia AI Aerial, which supports cloud-native 5G networks.The firm also raised its revenue and non-GAAP EPS estimates for FY2026/27 by 7% and 8%, respectively. This adjustment reflects higher cloud capex, strong AI server orders, and an improved outlook for chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) at TSMC.Wells Fargo cut Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock rating to Equal Weight from Overweight earlier in the week, pointing out several challenges that could halt the company's positive earnings revision momentum.The bank also reduced its price target for Amazon to $183 from $225.Although Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains a strong performer, Wells Fargo stated it is \"not enough\" to drive upward estimate revisions in the near term.Key concerns include Amazon's investments in Project Kuiper, pressure from Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) fees, and slowing growth from its advertising business.The firm also warned that \"margin expansion could be capped in 1H25 as well\" and suggested that positive revisions may not return until Amazon issues guidance in July 2025.\"While the market is more prepared for pressure on 4Q OI, we caution that margin expansion could be capped in 1H25 as well. As such, we move to Equal Weight until visibility into margin expansion resumes,\" Wells Fargo's team wrote.Moreover, Wells Fargo cut its operating income (OI) estimates for Amazon by $5.4 billion, $4.5 billion, and $5.5 billion for 2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively, attributing the reductions to slower monetization of its merchant services and advertising businesses.\"Amazon remains a margin expansion story,\" according to the bank, but it noted that the rate of this expansion will likely be slower than what the market currently anticipates.The note also highlighted rising competition from Walmart (NYSE:WMT), which has priced its fulfillment services 15% lower than Amazon's FBA, adding pressure to Amazon's market share.Morgan Stanley analysts voiced disappointment following Tesla's much-anticipated \"We, Robot\" event this week, citing a lack of key information about Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology, ride-sharing economics, and a clear go-to-market strategy for autonomous vehicles.Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares dropped nearly 9% Friday, as several analysts pointed to the absence of detailed updates during the event.Tesla did reveal its upcoming \"Cybercab,\" but Morgan Stanley remarked that the presentation lacked meaningful new insights. \"We were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation,\" analysts said in a note.Ahead of the event, Morgan Stanley had anticipated significant updates on Tesla's FSD technology, such as measurable improvements in miles driven without disengagements, but these specifics were not provided.The Wall Street firm also expected details on the strategy behind the company's supervised and unsupervised ride-sharing services, including economic analysis and estimates for the total addressable market (TAM).\"We had expected at least some incremental information around the 'rate of change' of the FSD system,\" it explained.Furthermore, the event did not provide any meaningful discussion on Tesla's collaboration with xAI or updates on Tesla's \"Master Plan 4,\" leaving Morgan Stanley analysts to conclude that the event failed to significantly move forward Tesla's narrative as an AI-focused company.Capital Economics warned in a Friday note that escalating trade disputes between the US and China, or a sharp rise in tensions between China and Taiwan, represent significant geopolitical risks that could \"prick the AI bubble.\"While tech stocks have seen strong performance this year, the firm cautioned that the rally could stall as geopolitical risks intensify, especially with the US presidential election approaching.A central concern is Taiwan's critical role in the AI supply chain. Taiwanese companies control around 90% of the market for advanced chips and AI servers, key drivers of the AI capital expenditure boom among major tech firms.According to Capital Economics, any disruption in this supply chain due to geopolitical conflict could have severe consequences.\"China could restrict the flow of highly advanced semiconductor chips and AI servers from Taiwan to the US, thereby breaking the 'AI supply chain,'\" the firm emphasized in a note.On the US-China trade front, the report points to potential risks of heightened tensions after the 2024 US presidential election.If Donald Trump returns to office, strategists anticipate \"a significant increase in tariffs on Chinese goods\" and a broader shift away from free trade, which would raise costs for tech companies. Even under a Harris administration, which is expected to maintain current export controls, there is still considerable risk to the tech sector.5 big analyst AI moves: Microsoft, Amazon rating cuts; Robotaxi day disappointsMoon race, private competition in focus as space powers gather in Milan",

    "title": "North Texas Native Americans want their voices heard ahead of 2024 presidential election",
    "content": "DALLAS -- Many Native Americans in North Texas don't feel their voices are being heard ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Others don't trust the government to have their best interests in mind.The over-arching concern for Native Americans is sovereignty, but a lack of engagement within their community and from politicians worries some. And with the expansion of SpaceX in South Texas and the political makeup of the Supreme Court, the nation's first people have a lot at stake.Both sides of the political spectrum in the Dallas metroplex have failed to engage Natives, said Jodi Voice Yellowfish, chair of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Woman Texas Rematriate. Voice Yellowfish is Muscogee Creek, Oglala Lakota and Cherokee.\"I feel like with all political candidates, there's an ignorance around sovereignty and what it means to have a relationship with another sovereign nation,\" she said.A tiny fraction -- 0.6% -- of people living in Dallas identify as American Indian or Alaska Native, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.But that number does not tell the whole story.\"We're not as small as the 0.6% would make us look,\" said Stephen Silva Brave, a member of the Lakota Nation and a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Texas at Arlington.There are actually far more Indigenous people living in Dallas and its surrounding metroplex than what's documented, Silva Brave said.For example, if someone checks off two different races in the U.S. Census survey, they're counted as multiracial. Someone like Silva Brave, who is Hispanic and Native American, wouldn't be included in the Native American count. As a result, many Indigenous people living in North Texas, Silva Brave said, feel left behind.There are 574 federally recognized tribes in the country, and nearly 6.8 million American Indian and Alaskan Natives live in the states. About 4.7 million are eligible to vote.National prioritiesBefore anyone can understand the relationship urban Natives have with politics, they must understand the history of the Indian Relocation Act, Silva Brave said.In 1956, the United States passed a law encouraging Native Americans to leave their reservations in favor of new lives integrated into urban areas.The goals of the act were to assimilate Native Americans into the white majority and provide vocational training to incorporate them into the general workforce. Over 10,000 Natives from 82 tribes moved to the Dallas area.Silva Brave, however, said critics believe the law diluted Indigenous culture and obstructed tribal and community ties. It also forced Natives off land the United States government sought to own and develop.\"They would offer a small amount of support and a lot of broken promises to get the people here,\" he said. \"It was just like, it's a worthless fight.\"Now, decades after his great-grandmother struggled through urban relocation at age 18 with no support, Silva Brave said the Indigenous fight for political recognition is far from over in North Texas.Native sovereigntySilva Brave and Rogelio Meixueiro, a member of the Zapotec tribe in Mexico and chair of the Indigenous Peoples Caucus of the Texas Democratic Party, said there is significant attention paid within Native communities to the Palestinian cause and the United States' decades-long alliance with Israel.\"A lot of people are not going to want to talk about it,\" Silva Brave said, \"but when you look at what's happening over there, it's an exact mirror of what happened to us.\"Meixueiro said, \"You can't be telling Native American people what genocide is.\"\"Particularly when it comes to the aspect of food, the aspect of resources, it's all connected,\" he said. \"Many Natives support the people of Palestine because we understand it's tied to imperialism and colonialism.\"But sovereignty, for Native Americans, is ensured by more than just land protection.Voice Yellowfish said one of the foremost protections of Native sovereignty is the Indian Child Welfare Act. Established in 1978, the federal law, dubbed \"ICWA,\" became a staple in preserving Native child welfare.The act emerged after decades of forcibly removing Native American children from their families in the era of Indian boarding schools, which sought to assimilate Native Americans into white culture, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior.\"It's just a reminder constantly when there's opposition to letting ICWA work for Native people, that colonization never ended, really,\" Voice Yellowfish said. \"There's not an end date to it. It's continued; it just looks different now.\"ICWA enforcement follows four distinct steps for Child Protective Services workers when removing a Native child from their initial home. The first is to place a child with a Native relative. If that cannot be done, they should be placed with a member of the same tribe. In the instance that no tribal member can care for the child, a Native group home is considered as a last resort.If none of these options are viable, the child can be placed with non-Native foster parents.Before the law was signed, nearly 80% of Native families living on reservations lost at least one child to the foster care system.In the spring of 1968, Dwayne Stenstrom -- just 8 years old -- saw his grandfather for the last time. A van pulled up to his home on the Winnebago reservation in Nebraska, and the driver told him he'd be going away for the summer for no longer than about four to six weeks.Stenstrom is a member of the Winnebago Ho-Chunk tribe in Nebraska. He is one of seven children, all of whom were taken from the reservation and placed in the foster care system.He and his younger brother were driven out of the reservation and into foster care, rotating in and out of homes for months hosted by non-Native families.Eventually, Stenstrom and his brother were placed with an elderly white couple whose own children had grown up and moved out. He waited for the van, but it never returned.He turned 18 the year ICWA was signed into federal law.A year ago, the ICWA was just two votes short of being reversed by the Supreme Court in the landmark case Haaland v. Brackeen, and many Indigenous people in North Texas fear it's only a matter of time before the law -- and their sovereignty -- again comes under threat.\"It all starts with ICWA,\" Silva Brave said. \"It's the first domino for taking away all sovereignty ...because what they want to do is end it, so they can say that tribes don't have sovereignty, and then they can build the pipelines they want and do whatever they want on reservations on tribal lands.\"The case, brought forth by a couple from Fort Worth, challenged the constitutionality of ICWA.The couple, joined by other plaintiffs, argued ICWA was discriminatory against non-Native families who sought to adopt Native children. In a 7-2 ruling on June 15, 2023, the court upheld ICWA with a majority opinion acknowledging the importance of Native children to Native survival. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, both Republicans, voted to reverse the act.With the election in November looming, Silva Brave, a member of the Sicangu Lakota nation, is holding his breath. He called the law \"life-saving.\"\"If the next president replaces two justices with two very far right-leaning people, everything is on the table again,\" Silva Brave said. \"And I'm sure they'll try it again.\"Still, even with ICWA in place, some Native children have fallen through the cracks.Sandra Blackbear Ramirez, 73, is a member of the Kiowa tribe and a descendant of the Kiowa Apache, or the Apache of Oklahoma. For more than 30 years, Blackbear Ramirez worked as a regional nurse consultant for Texas Child Protective Services and often served as an Indian Child Welfare expert for the department.When Blackbear Ramirez first started at Texas CPS in 1986, she was told there were no Native American children in CPS custody.\"Back then, they thought it was true,\" she said, \"until I went and started identifying them.\"According to Texas Department of Family and Protective Services documents, the state had 18 documented American Indian children in foster care at the end of the 1986 fiscal year.Blackbear Ramirez was handed the book of children who were eligible for adoption. In the catalog of children organized by race, she noticed there was no section for Native American kids.\"There was a section that said mixed, and so I happened to flip there,\" she said. \"I discovered they had children who were two or three different races, including Native American, and I said, 'Do you realize that you do have Native Americans?'\"\"And I told , you're required under the Indian Child Welfare Act to notify the family,\" Blackbear Ramirez said.Blackbear Ramirez said without ICWA or its proper enforcement, the result would be an unfathomable loss of culture.\"They're not funding Indian Child Welfare programs in Texas,\" she said. \"I've always wanted somehow to work with them to try to educate Texas' Court Appointed Special Advocates on how this works and do lateral training where the CASA worker learns the spirit of the Indian Child Welfare Act and what's supposed to happen with that.\"\"But at this point, we don't have that,\" Blackbear Ramirez added, \"because of funding. It could come from the state, it could come from the federal government, but I think they both need to take responsibility.\"Local prioritiesSeveral Natives in Texas said they are also fighting for increased classroom representation. Silva Brave said Natives and allies have been advocating for a Native Studies class for several years -- the State Board of Education delayed decisions about the course in April.Silva Brave also is watching a struggle farther south in Boca Chica, a small town just outside of Brownsville on the edge of the Texas-Mexico border.\"Especially in the state of Texas, it's a constant struggle to remind people that you are sovereign and that this is your land,\" Silva Brave said. \"The SpaceX stuff is built so close to tribal lands, and they're always having to fight to keep their ancestral land safe from being taken over.\"\"We need representatives who care about this no longer happening.\"Meixueiro, whose close friends are involved in Indigenous organizing in Boca Chica, said lands connected to major tribal water sources are at risk of contamination in the face of pollution from Elon Musk's SpaceX venture, which has a large launch site in the area. The Environmental Protection Agency found Starbase violated the Clean Water Ac t after discharges from rocket launches ran into the wetlands.\"We're scared,\" he said. \"We've seen the harm and the fires, and there's been no studies yet of the environmental impact that is positive.\"RepresentationAbout 66 percent of the known eligible Native American voting population is registered to vote, according to a 2020 report by the Native American Rights Fund.The population generally leans Democratic, according to a 2022 poll conducted by the African American Research Collaborative. In the 2022 House races across the country, Natives supported Democratic candidates at 56% compared to 40% of Native voters supporting Republicans.However, Nita Battise, tribal council vice chairperson for the Alabama Coushatta located in Livingston, said bipartisanship can be the greatest strength of Indigenous peoples.\"By maintaining bipartisanship, you have the attention of both parties,\" Batisse said. \"As tribal leaders, we attend both party-sponsored events because you must always be in a position to negotiate and engage them in conversation.\"\"We're not asking to just be recognized, like another category,\" Meixueiro added. \"But rather, we're trying to make sure that we're carving out the space for our community, and that is actually there.\"Silva Brave said that Dallas City Councilman Omar Narvaez has been a loyal ally for the Native community in DFW at the local level, as well as Aicha Davis and Marissa Perez-Diaz on the State Board of Education.Within his community, Silva Brave said there is a significant amount of political apathy colored by an unforgivable history and a feeling of resignation. But to rectify Native distrust in the government, officials must demonstrate a commitment to listening to Indigenous voices.\"When you're talking about politics, I think it's easy for people to say, 'We can't focus on such a small voting bloc,' \" he said. \"We're just now getting people to understand the concept of us as not a race but as political entities.\"Silva Brave recalled an overwhelming sentiment of community trust that supersedes the desire for political participation, particularly for community elders.\"American Indians have gone through so much: genocide, wars, famine, boarding schools, relocation, and through all of it, we're still here, without support and despite the government not working for us,\" he said. \"So a lot of the time, we think, 'Why do I even need to do that? My life is going to be the same. My community has my back.'\"For Natives to secure political representation, they must ensure access to the ballot box.Meixueiro, who visited El Paso on an organizing trip aimed at encouraging Natives to vote in 2020, said several Indigenous people reported not being able to present their tribal ID to vote. Tribal identification cards qualify under federal law as the mandatory identification required to participate in elections.\"What we're seeing is that in bigger cities where people don't know this is a federal law, people are being turned away,\" he said. \"And that's just another form of Native erasure.\"Battise said the reservation, located just an hour and a half north of Houston, is an official voting station, which helps secure the Native vote.She said beyond making voting more accessible to Indigenous people, electing and appointing Native leaders to positions in government is another means for ensuring Natives are represented in American democracy.Battise pointed to Deb Haaland, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna and the first Native American to serve as a cabinet secretary, as an example of positive Native representation in mainstream politics.But they aren't finished.\"There should be a Native American Supreme Court justice,\" Silva Brave said. \"And we need to be voting accordingly.\"©2024 The Dallas Morning News.

    "content": "Former President Donald Trump has lashed out at the newly released film \"The Apprentice,\" which portrays his life and career in the 1970s and 1980s in New York City.Trump took to Truth Social to express his disapproval of the movie. \"A FAKE and CLASSLESS Movie written about me, called, The Apprentice (Do they even have the right to use that name without approval?), will hopefully 'bomb,'\" Trump wrote. \"It's a cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country, \"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"He went on to complain specifically about the depiction of his relationship with his first wife, the late Ivana Trump, the mother of his three eldest children.\"My former wife, Ivana, was a kind and wonderful person, and I had a great relationship with her until the day she died. The writer of this pile of garbage, Gabe Sherman, a lowlife and talentless hack, who has long been widely discredited, knew that, but chose to ignore it,\" he said.\"So sad that HUMAN SCUM, like the people involved in this hopefully unsuccessful enterprise, are allowed to say and do whatever they want in order to hurt a Political Movement, which is far bigger than any of us.\" Trump said.The new movie, starring Sebastian Stan as Trump, was released on October 11. It was written by political journalist Sherman and directed by Ali Abbasi.The film depicts the beginning and the decline of Trump's relationship with Ivana, including portraying a scene in which he allegedly raped her. Ivana alleged that Trump raped her in a 1990 court deposition during their divorce, but she later recanted the allegation in 2015.While disavowing the allegation, Ivana explained that she once felt \"violated\" by Trump during sexual relations because \"the love and tenderness, which he normally exhibited towards me, was absent.\"\"I referred to this as a 'rape,' but I do not want my words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense,\" she added.In an emailed statement to Newsweek, Trump's campaign communications director Steven Cheung said: \"The filmmakers now readily admit they fabricated scenes and created fake stories to fit some deranged narrative about President Trump that is completely untrue. This garbage is pure fiction which sensationalizes lies that have been long debunked.\"\"This 'film' is pure malicious defamation, should never see the light of day, and doesn't even deserve a place in the straight-to-DVD section of a bargain bin at a soon-to-be-closed discount movie store, it belongs in a dumpster fire,\" he saidSherman has said that all the scenes in the movie are based on records of real events.Speaking about Ivana's alleged rape, Sherman noted that she made the allegations \"under oath,\" per USA Today. \"In fact, the scene she described in the divorce papers was actually far more graphic and brutal than the one we dramatized in the film.\"",

    "title": "Immigration: Where do Trump and Harris stand? * Michigan Advance",
    "content": "This is one in a series of States Newsroom reports on the major policy issues in the presidential race.WASHINGTON -- Immigration remains at the forefront of the 2024 presidential election, with both candidates taking a tougher stance than in the past on the flow of migrants into the United States.GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump has made immigration a core campaign issue, as he did in his two previous bids for the White House, and has expanded his attacks this time around to include false claims about migrants with legal status in specific locations like Springfield, Ohio.He's often demonized immigrants in speeches and at rallies, and has vowed to enact the mass deportation of millions of people living in the United States without authorization.Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, like the Biden administration, has shifted to the right on immigration, embracing limits to asylum and advocating for added border security, as migrant encounters hit a record high at the end of 2023. With those new policies in place, migrant encounters have sharply fallen this year.Vice President Harris in her remarks on immigration has mainly stuck to her promise to sign into law a bipartisan border security deal that three senators struck earlier this year. That legislation, if enacted, would have been the most drastic change in U.S. immigration law in decades.The deal never made it out of the Senate. Once Trump expressed his displeasure with the bill, House Republicans pulled their support, and the GOP in the upper chamber followed suit.Harris has not detailed her positions on immigration beyond her support of the border security bill.Regardless of who wins the White House, the incoming administration will be tasked with the fate of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects a little over half a million undocumented people brought into the United States as children without authorization. A Texas legal challenge threatens the legality of the program, and the case could make its way up to the U.S. Supreme Court.Additionally, work visas, massive backlogs in U.S. immigration courts and renewing those individuals in Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, will fall to the next administration. Neither candidate has laid out how they would handle those issues.The Trump campaign did not respond to States Newsroom's request for comment.The Harris campaign pointed to the vice president's remarks from an Arizona campaign rally where she acknowledged the U.S. has a broken immigration system and put her support behind border security and legal pathways to citizenship.Harris also took a September trip to the southern border.Harris has made the bipartisan border deal a centerpiece of her campaign. She's often promised to sign it into law and has used the proposal to criticize Trump.\"We can create an earned pathway to citizenship and secure our border,\" Harris said during the Democratic National Convention in August.The bill negotiated by senators would need to reach the 60-vote threshold to advance through the chamber. But after Trump came out against it and it was brought to the floor, the Republican who handled negotiations with Democrats and the White House, Oklahoma's James Lankford, voted against his own bill.Additionally, House Democrats in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and immigration groups were not supportive of the bill.\"I will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he killed, and I will sign it into law,\" Harris said at the DNC.The measure raises the bar for asylum, and would require asylum seekers to provide greater proof of their fear of persecution.The bill would have also provided $20 billion for the hiring of more than 4,000 asylum officers, legal counsel for unaccompanied minors and the purchase of drug screening technology at ports of entry. It would also have provided $8 billion for detention facilities to add 50,000 detention beds.The plan did include some legal pathways to citizenship for Afghans who aided the U.S. and fled in 2021 after the U.S. withdrew from the country. It also provided up to 10,000 special visas for family members of those Afghan allies.It also would have added 250,000 green-card employee and family-based visas over the next five years.\"Send them back,\" is chanted at Trump's rallies, where he often promises to carry out mass deportations.There are roughly 11 million people in the U.S. without legal authorization.\"We're going to have the largest deportation,\" Trump said at a June campaign rally in Racine, Wisconsin. \"We have no choice.\"Under Trump's vision, mass deportation would be a broad, multipronged effort that includes invoking an 18th-century law; reshuffling law enforcement at federal agencies; transferring funds within programs in the Department of Homeland Security; and forcing greater enforcement of immigration laws.In a May 2023 campaign video, Trump said if he wins the White House, one of his first moves would be to issue an executive order ending birthright citizenship, which means anyone born in the U.S., regardless of their parents' status, is an American citizen.This is enshrined in the 14th Amendment of the Constitution and would likely face legal challenges.\"As part of my plan to secure the border, on Day One of my new term in office, I will sign an executive order making clear to federal agencies that under the correct interpretation of the law, going forward, the future children of illegal aliens will not receive automatic U.S. citizenship,\" Trump said.Promise: deportation of pro-Palestinian students on visasAcross the country, students on college campuses during the past year have set up encampments and protests calling for a cease-fire in Gaza and an end to the Israel-Hamas war.In the initial attack on Oct. 7, 2023, more than 1,200 people were killed in Israel and hundreds taken hostage. As the war has continued, researchers estimate that as many as 186,000 Palestinians have been killed.At a private dinner in May, Trump told donors that \"any student that protests, I throw them out of the country,\" according to the Washington Post.\"You know, there are a lot of foreign students,\" Trump said. \"As soon as they hear that, they're going to behave.\"Trump also made that vow during a campaign rally in October 2023 in Las Vegas, Nevada.\"We'll terminate the visas of all of Hamas' sympathizers, and we'll get them off our college campuses, out of our cities and get them the hell out of our country, if that's OK with you,\" he said.The Republican party made it part of its party platform in July.With immigration reform stalled in Congress, one way the Biden administration has handled mass migration is the use of humanitarian parole programs. Those humanitarian parole programs have been used for Ukrainians fleeing the war with Russia, Afghans fleeing after the U.S. withdrawal and for Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans.More than 1 million people have been paroled into the U.S. under the executive authority extended by the Biden administration.Trump said in a November 2023 campaign video he would end this policy on his first day in office.\"I will stop the outrageous abuse of parole authority,\" Trump said.In a June podcast interview, Trump said that he was supportive of giving green cards to foreign students if they graduate from a U.S. college.\"What I will do is, if you graduate from a college, I think you should get, automatically as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,\" Trump said. \"That includes junior colleges, too.\"This would be done through rulemaking from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.On the podcast, Trump also said he would extend H-1B visas for tech workers. Those visas allow employers to hire foreign workers for specialized occupations, usually for a high skill role.On social media, the Trump campaign said it would put in place an \"ideological screening\" for all immigrants and bar those who have sympathies toward Hamas.Trump has stated in various campaign speeches that he plans to reinstate his immigration policies from his first term.That would include the continuation of building a wall along the southern border; reissuing a travel ban on individuals from predominantly Muslim countries; suspending travel of refugees; reinstating a public health policy that barred migrants from claiming asylum amid the coronavirus pandemic; and reinstating the remain in Mexico policy that required asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while awaiting their cases.",

    "content": "Your morning review of the issues and players behind Florida politics.The Florida Chamber of Commerce is launching a new anti-Amendment 3 website outlining the potential hazards of legalizing pot.This site, www.FLBizAgainstA3.com, is part of the Chamber's effort to educate residents and business leaders on the possible adverse ripple effects of Amendment 3, including the severe consequences for local businesses, public safety, Florida's brand and Florida's quality of life.The Florida Chamber has opposed placing recreational marijuana in the Constitution for years, and the \"No on 3\" effort includes the leadership of Gov. Ron DeSantis, the Florida Sheriff's Association, numerous members of the Local Chamber Federation, and other community and legislative leaders.\"Only three states have legalized recreational marijuana by 60%, and we're fighting to make sure Florida doesn't become the 4th,\" said Florida Chamber President and CEO Mark Wilson. \"The passage of Amendment 3 would jeopardize Florida's family-friendly and business-friendly climate while driving up costs for local businesses and families and degrading our quality of life.\"Just like pregnant pigs had no place in our state constitution decades ago, legalizing drugs should not be rammed into our foundational document just because one company can dump $100 million into an ad campaign. The risks far outweigh any potential benefits, and we urge all Floridians to stand with us in opposing this dangerous amendment,\" Wilson said.The new website provides detailed information on how Amendment 3 could impact various industries across Florida. It also includes employer-to-employee educational tools for businesses to get involved in the \"No on 3\" campaign. The website also includes data on how legalization has affected businesses in other states and quotes from Florida elected officials and leaders opposing Amendment 3.U.S. Sen.

In addition to dozens of Republicans, the list included a pair of elected Democrats: Gadsden County Sheriff Morris Young and Calhoun County Sheriff Glenn Kimbrel.Scott's campaign said the new \"Leadership\" ad is part of the $10 million statewide ad buy announced earlier this month.-- @ScottWagnerFL: .@GovRonDeSantis does a presser in front of where debris is stacked and they freak out.

That \"Special Flood Hazard Area\" designation compels homeowners to buy flood insurance if they want to get a federally-backed mortgage, indicating where the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) sees a risk of a 1-in-100-year flood. Scientists consider that zone, which amounts to a 1% chance of flooding in a given year, as facing significant danger.According to a Post analysis of First Street's data in those mountainous areas, the number of properties at risk could be seven times higher than what FEMA flood maps indicate.The discrepancy shows how the agency's maps -- which rely only on floods observed in the past and don't take into account flooding from heavy rain, small streams and tributaries, or climate change's future impact -- can fall short when assessing current risks in a wetter, hotter world.\"President Joe Biden surveys Pinellas storm damage, pledges funds after Hurricanes Milton, Helene\" via Divya Kumar of the Tampa Bay Times -- Standing in front of a storm-battered home outside Sunset Park, Biden announced $612 million in new investments in projects to support recovery from Milton and Helene. The funds, dispersed through the U.S. Department of Energy, include $47 million to Florida Power & Light and $47 million to Gainesville Regional Utilities. Biden said the funds would make electric grids more resilient and help reduce the frequency and duration of power outages \"while extreme weather events become more frequent.\" Biden said he spoke to business owners and residents in St. Pete Beach and empathized with what it's like to lose a home, recalling when his home was struck by lightning and he lost possessions.\"Ron DeSantis misses post-hurricane meeting with Biden -- again\" via Zach Montellaro of POLITICO -- DeSantis skipped meeting with Biden, the second time in as many weeks that the Governor did not meet with Biden while in Florida touring storm damage. Biden traveled to the state to survey the aftermath of Milton, which wreaked havoc on Florida earlier this week. The storm caused significant damage in the state after touching down along the Gulf Coast, bringing heavy rains, high winds and tornadoes across the peninsula. According to pool reports, Biden took an aerial tour of the damage over Tampa Bay and received a briefing on the recovery effort. Biden told reporters before departing the state that he had not spoken with DeSantis Sunday. A spokesperson for the Governor confirmed DeSantis did not meet with Biden, adding that the office was represented by the state's emergency management chief, Kevin Guthrie, at the briefing.\"Catastrophe bond investors brace for huge losses as Milton rages\" via Gautam Naik of Bloomberg -- Investors in catastrophe bonds are girding themselves for substantial losses as the combined destructive force of Helene and Milton looks set to trigger payment clauses on a scale not seen in years. Catastrophe bonds, or cat bonds as they're known in the industry, are issued by insurers and reinsurers to provide financial protection against the most severe natural disasters. Investors who buy the bonds stand to make large gains if a predefined event doesn't occur but can lose a big chunk of their capital if it does. Those losses are used to cover insurance claims.\"13 days, 2 hurricanes, and incalculable anxiety in Tampa Bay\" via Christopher Spata of the Tampa Bay Times -- Hurricanes are part of the price we pay to live on a \"peninsula in the tropics,\" as Florida's emergency management director described the state this week. We get 200-plus days of annual sunshine, cotton-candy sunsets and sweet tropical fruit in our backyards. We also face the occasional threat of annihilation. Longtime residents know the routine when it comes to hurricanes and, after the past two weeks, so do the many transplants who have moved to a part of the state that was affected, which is pretty much all of it. The fear ran more profound this time, nipping at the heels of Tampa Bay's worst storm in a century. Our chests ached as dark daydreams crept into those long, long hours. Where would it go? And how could we possibly take any more? On Saturday, two days after Milton, sawdust flew under a gentle sky as we cut through fallen palms and stowed the plywood shutters. We stared at the estimates the power company sent, promises that the lights would come back on. We left our key cards at the front desk, prayed for open roads and began the drive home.\"At Milton's ground zero on Siesta Key, a double whammy of damage\" via Joey Flechas and Al Diaz of the Miami Herald -- Standing on a thick layer of sand, Adam Robinson's head nearly reached the ceiling of his beachfront condo in Siesta Key -- ground zero for Milton. The storm had dumped much of the beach into the living room and rearranged the furniture. The leather recliner jammed the front door between the wall and the kitchen counter. A piece of what used to be a wooden walkway to the beach lay in his living room. This is what a double whammy of major hurricanes did to this stretch of Florida's Gulf Coast, renowned for its fine white beach sand and gorgeous Gulf of Mexico views. Two weeks before Milton made landfall on this barrier island off Sarasota late Wednesday night, Helene had churned some 100 miles offshore on its way to a landfall far to the north in the Big Bend.\"A retirement community prepared for a hurricane. Tornadoes came instead\" via Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs of The New York Times -- Victor Linero was watching coverage of Milton's churn toward Florida when, suddenly, he saw a live video of a tornado near his grandfather's home -- hours before the hurricane was supposed to hit on the opposite side of the state. In a panic, Linero warned his grandfather over the phone that he needed to take cover. \"I was screaming, 'Papi, get shelter now!'\" recalled Linero, 26, who was raised by his grandfather. \"And then I start hearing, 'Oh my God. Ahh!'\" He heard his grandfather, Alejandro Alonso, 66, let out a final scream. Then, the other end of the line went silent.\"Gulf Coast beach towns reel from back-to-back hurricanes but promise a 'comeback'\" via Steven Walker and Michael Cuglietta of the Orlando Sentinel -- Up and down Florida's Gulf Coast, along a 100-mile stretch from Sanibel Island north to Treasure Island, unwelcome visits from two powerful hurricanes left residents stunned and weary. But lured by these barrier islands -- one of the state's most captivating but fragile ecological gems -- most said they were determined to rebuild. The storms also left regular visitors to the islands -- whether from as close as Orlando or as far away as London -- monitoring the damage online and mourning the wreckage of beloved vacation spots known for their postcard-perfect sunsets, fine fishing and laid-back vibes. \"So sad! So many beautiful beaches ruined! Praying for everyone's safety!\" a New York woman wrote on St. Pete Beach's Facebook page.\"After Milton, a feeling of 'fight or flight' along Pinellas beaches\" via Lauren Peace and Shreya Vuttaluru of the Tampa Bay Times -- While the story of Helene was written in close-call rescues, drownings and flooded buildings -- the wreckage of which still lines hundreds of miles of Pinellas roads -- that of Milton was defined for many by a dizzying combination of relief and exhaustion on the back of immediate heartache. The Tampa Bay region was spared the surge forecasters said could have reached 15 feet. But just days after residents first returned to their homes to clean up debris from one deadly storm, Milton came as another hard blow. \"It's almost like a fight or flight feeling,\" said Kelcey Marsan, 28. \"You don't have time to sit and cry.\"\"Take a look at the damage to this 'old Florida' beach; colorful cottages toppled\" via Tiffany Tompkins, Ryan Ballogg and Milena Malaver of the Miami Herald -- Bradenton Beach residents got to see the damage firsthand from Milton as they were allowed back on their beloved Gulf island community Friday morning. Longboat Key Bridge, which links Bradenton Beach with Longboat Key, reopened Friday afternoon. Anna Maria Island, a popular vacation spot known for its pristine beaches, cafes and gorgeous sunsets on the Gulf of Mexico, opened on Sunday.\"'Boom! It was coming in': Glen Eagles residents recall terror of Milton's assault\" via Jim Abbott of the Daytona Beach News-Journal -- It was around 12:30 a.m. Thursday, as the brunt of Milton's assault was starting to slam into Volusia and Flagler counties, when John Felgate rolled out of bed to feel damp carpet beneath his toes in the home that he shares with his wife, Sharon, in Glen Eagles Golf Villas. \"He was thinking that we had a roof leak,\" Sharon said. It didn't take long for the couple to realize that the scene unfolding before them was unimaginably more dangerous and catastrophic. Like other residents in the subdivision along Orange Camp Road, just east of U.S. Highway 17-92 on DeLand's southern side, Milton's life-threatening floods were suddenly at their doorsteps.\"They came to Florida for a slice of paradise. Now they are packing their bags\" via Arian Campo-Flores of The Wall Street Journal -- Cin-dee Cawley moved to Florida two decades ago for the same reason so many others have: the lure of tropical living at a reasonable price. That was before the latest hurricane, Milton, lashed Englewood with fierce winds and storm surge this week. It was also before Hurricane Helene two weeks ago, Debby in August and Ian in 2022. Each time, Cawley endured the anxiety of facing a potentially devastating loss, the disruption of preparing for the storm and the sometimes-laborious cleanup afterward. \"It's too much,\" said Cawley, who was spending the day cleaning her sister's deluged property. Her own home had some gutters ripped off. \"It's like playing Russian roulette. I don't want to play anymore.\"\"Hurricane surge could blow away Florida homeowners insurance 'fixes'\" via Christine Sexton of the Florida Phoenix -- Floridians already pay the highest homeowners insurance premiums in the nation. While the state's top politicians contend they have taken steps to fix that, major hurricanes may have blown any progress. There were fears that the storm would take a direct hit at the Tampa Bay region, a low-lying area vulnerable to storm surge. That didn't happen. Still, the damage could run into the billions. And that could have a cascading effect on what residents ultimately pay. This is now the third hurricane to land in Florida this year; storm season doesn't end until Nov. 30.\"Determination to rebuild follows Florida's hurricanes with acceptance that storms will come again\" via The Associated Press -- No sooner had residents of the Bahia Vista Gulf condominium complex dug out from Helene than they were faced with the same daunting cleanup from new damage inflicted by Milton. The beachfront units had been gutted, treated, and dried out after Helene, and mounds of sand blown in from the beach had been removed. Less than two weeks later, Milton barreled in and undid all the progress. \"They've got to start the whole process over, cleaning, sanitizing, bringing in drying equipment, getting them all dried and prepped for renovations,\" lamented Bill O'Connell, a Board member at the complex in Venice, about an hour's drive south of Tampa. The second hurricane \"brought all the sand back on our property.\" Some longtime Floridians have grown accustomed to the annual cycle of storms that can shatter and upend lives in a state known primarily for its balmy weather, sunshine and beaches.\"On one Gulf Coast street flooded by Milton, benefits of elevated homes stand out\" via Charles Rabin of the Miami Herald -- Marilyn Gladish spent Friday picking trash from the wet goo that had accumulated on her front lawn while workers power washed mud that had infiltrated her ground-floor garage. But the 83-year-old's home -- built high on pilings -- wasn't damaged. Everything inside was clean and dry, from furniture to a lifetime of keepsakes. Gregg Wood, whose home was just around the corner, didn't fare so well. Virtually every piece of furniture and every appliance in his home was destroyed. The walls were soggy. The wood floor, drenched and muddy, had to be torn up. Surveying the roof, Wood, 59, put on a brave face but worried that it, too, had to be rebuilt.\"Fraud investigators comb Florida looking for contractors ready to rip off hurricane victims\" via Drew Dixon of Florida Politics -- Disaster Fraud Action Strike Teams are being deployed to several counties in Florida that were impacted by Milton. Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis sent the teams into the state over the weekend to seek out potential rip-off scams that could victimize residents adversely impacted by the monster storm. Three teams with 18 personnel were dispatched to seek out the potential fraudsters and educate the public. \"I refuse to allow fraudsters to come between you and your recovery; that's why I have deployed my Disaster Fraud Action Strike Teams to storm-impacted areas, including Hillsborough, Sarasota, and St. Lucie counties, to be on the lookout for bad actors,\" Patronis said in a news release.Jimmy Patronis brings 'insurance village' to Bradenton -- CFO Patronis announced that the Florida Department of Financial Services Division of Consumer Services will host an insurance village in Bradenton today from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The village will connect policyholders with their insurance carriers in person, allowing them to work together to file insurance claims related to Milton and Helene. The CFO's office said policyholders attending the event should bring as much documentation as possible, including driver's license or other form of ID; insurance cards and insurance policy information/documentation; pictures or documentation of the property being claimed as a loss resulting from Helene; repair estimates; and any additional insurance-related information that is readily accessible. Patronis' office plans to announce more insurance villages in the coming days.\"Polk deputies aid pregnant woman in labor during hurricane, ensuring safe hospital transfer\" via Michelle Vecerina of Florida's Voice -- Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd announced that amid Milton Thursday, deputies assisted a young pregnant woman to the hospital to deliver her baby while ambulances were unable to assist. The sheriff's office received a 911 emergency call Thursday around 3 a.m. regarding a young pregnant woman going into labor amid the ongoing impact of Milton in Polk County. Deputies arrived at the home and met the expecting parents, Zenia and Javier. One deputy assisted the couple into the patrol car, transporting them to the hospital, while two other deputies drove one of their relatives. \"Our deputies went back to the hospital later in the day to check up on everyone and learned that Zenia gave birth to a baby girl named Jade at about 1:30 p.m.,\" Judd said.\"More than $10M in small business bridge loans granted to Helene victims in Florida\" via Drew Dixon of Florida Politics -- Hundreds of businesses have been helped by FloridaCommerce in the wake of Helene and state officials are pointing out the same can happen for small businesses adversely affected by Milton. FloridaCommerce officials issued a news release noting that $10 million has already been distributed in the form of the Florida Small Business Emergency Bridge Loan Program for Helene relief alone. That storm slammed Florida's Big Bend area on Sept. 26. It pounded much of Florida's Gulf Coast before moving inland and causing havoc through inland areas of Georgia, the Carolinas, and Tennessee. Over 240 small businesses in Florida have received bridge loans thus far for Helene relief.\"Cory Mills said he's working with Elon Musk to bring Starlink service online after Milton\" via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics -- U.S. Rep. Mills said he's working with Musk to restore internet service in Florida after Milton. Mills said he received 50 Starlink mini-systems. Starlink, a subsidy of the Musk-owned SpaceX, is offering free internet service through the rest of the year for victims of Helene and Milton, two major hurricanes that hit Florida in the last three weeks. When Helene cut off several road connections to North Carolina communities affected by Milton, Mills delivered supplies, including Starlink kits, as a private citizen by helicopter. Mills said he's working with Musk and Mercury One, a nonprofit founded by conservative pundit Glenn Beck, to set up systems in the Florida district he represents in Congress.\"Tampa General AquaFence again saves the day during Milton\" via Janelle Irwin Taylor of Florida Politics -- Tampa General Hospital (TGH) has successfully weathered Milton with an assist from its AquaFence. It's the second time in two weeks that the innovative flood prevention device has protected the Tampa Bay region's only Level 1 Trauma Center. The water-impermeable barrier was installed to protect vulnerable areas of TGH's campus against storm surges up to 15 feet above sea level. \"Preparing for Hurricane Milton was an incredible effort by the entire team and a true test of our resources, but it ensured we could continue to provide exceptional care for our patients in a high-quality, safe, and uninterrupted environment before, during, and after the storm,\" TGH President and CEO John Couris said.\"AT&T contributes $100K to Milton victims, mobilizes other relief assistance from company\" via Drew Dixon of Florida Politics -- Communications giant AT&T is donating $100,000 to relief efforts in the wake of Milton and is contributing funds to help its employees adversely affected by the storm that slammed Florida. AT&T officials say they are contributing the $100,000 in funds to Volunteer Florida. The agency is a nonprofit, bipartisan group headed by a Board of Commissioners appointed by Florida's Governor to administer national service programs and natural disaster relief efforts. \"Our hearts go out to the communities affected by Hurricane Milton,\" AT&T Florida President Joe York said in a news release.\"Kamala Harris packs supplies for Western North Carolina in Raleigh before heading to rally in Greenville\" via Tammy Grubb and Avi Bajpai of the Miami Herald -- Harris landed in Raleigh to meet supporters and pack hurricane relief supplies as her Presidential campaign resumed following Helene's devastating impact on Western North Carolina. She was expected to spend Saturday night in Raleigh before heading east Sunday for a campaign rally. Harris is scheduled to speak at 4:40 p.m. Sunday in Greenville before returning to Washington later in the evening. Harris arrived at Raleigh-Durham International Airport at around 5:45 p.m. Saturday and traveled by motorcade to The Pit Authentic Barbecue in downtown Raleigh. There, she meets with members of the Black community, politicians, and faith leaders before helping box up several care packages of diapers, hand sanitizers, and other supplies for Western North Carolina.\"As Florida recovers from Milton, Donald Trump keeps his focus elsewhere\" via Max Greenwood of the Miami Herald -- As Floridians braced for Milton this week, Trump was focused on other things. At a rally in Pennsylvania, he railed against Harris and Sunny Hostin, the co-host of ABC's \"The View.\" In a string of posts on his social media site Truth Social, he claimed that Harris' \"60 Minutes\" interview had been spliced and edited to his opponent's advantage. He has repeatedly blasted the federal response to Helene, which dealt a particularly hard blow to western North Carolina late last month. It wasn't until Thursday, more than 12 hours after the storm made landfall in Florida as a Category 3 hurricane, that Trump cut a video expressing support for his adopted home state in Milton's aftermath.\"'Dead heat': Trump pulls even with Harris\" via Mark Murray of NBC News -- Trump and Harris are deadlocked in a poll, with Trump bolstered by Republicans coming back home to support him after last month's rough debate and a subsequent polling deficit, as well as by a favorable voter assessment of Trump's term as President. \"As Summer has turned to Fall, any signs of momentum for Kamala Harris have stopped,\" said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt. Underlining the poll is uncertainty about the election (with 10% of voters saying they might change their minds and a sliver of unclaimed voters still on the fence), an all-time-high share of voters believing that this election will make \"a great deal of difference\" in their lives, and key challenges for both Harris and Trump.\"Economic discontent, issue divisions add up to tight presidential contest\" via Gary Langer of ABC News -- Beneath the horse race, issues pull in opposite directions. The poll with fieldwork by Ipsos, finds that 56% of Americans now favor deporting all undocumented immigrants, up 20 points from eight years ago. That reinforces one of Trump's strongest issues, with a 10-point Trump lead in trust to handle immigration at the southern border. Yet the same share, 56%, side with Harris on abortion, saying the federal government should restore access to what it was before the Supreme Court eliminated the constitutional right to abortion in 2022. 44% of Americans say they're not as well off now as they were when Biden took office, tying the most negative number on this question in data since 1986.\"Poll: Donald Trump holds 4-point lead in Florida, but trails significantly with independents\" via Jesse Scheckner of Florida Politics -- Trump still leads in the Sunshine State, where younger, White and Latino voters prefer him over Harris, according to newly released polling data. Marist Poll surveyed 1,510 Florida adults on Oct. 3-7 by phone, text, and online. Of them, 1,257 say they will definitely vote in this year's General Election. Among likely voters, including those still undecided but leaning toward a candidate, 51% say they support Trump compared to 47% who side with Harris. Eighty-eight percent of those with a preference say they strongly support their chosen candidate. Notably, Harris holds a significant lead (55%-41%) among independents. That's a margin more significant than Biden enjoyed in 2020.\"Trump suggests heckler should 'get the hell knocked out of her' after rally\" via Hannah Knowles and Marianne LeVine of The Washington Post -- Trump suggested that a heckler would later get \"the hell knocked out of her\" during an insult-laced speech here Saturday that portrayed a dark image of the country and demonized undocumented immigrants. As Trump called the Nov. 5 election a \"chance to send a message,\" he stopped his remarks and turned to the crowd. \"Back home to mommy, she goes back home to mommy,\" Trump said, resuming his speech and appearing to address a heckler. \"'Was that you darling?' And she gets the hell knocked out of her. Her mother's a big fan of ours; you know that, right? Her father, her mother. You always have that.\"\"A frustrated Trump lashes out behind closed doors over money\" via Jonathan Swan, Maggie Haberman and Shane Goldmacher of The New York Times -- Trump took his seat at the dining table in his triplex penthouse apartment atop Trump Tower on the last Sunday in September, alongside some of the most sought-after and wealthiest figures in the Republican Party. Some politicians might have taken the moment to be charming and ingratiating with the donors. Not Trump. The former President tore through a bitter list of grievances. He made it clear that people, including donors, needed to do more, appreciate him more and help him more. He disparaged Vice President Harris as \"retarded.\" At one point, Trump seemed to suggest that these donors had plenty to be grateful to him for. He boasted about how great he had been for their taxes, something that some privately noted wasn't true for everyone in the room.\"Harris' hundred-day campaign\" via Evan Osnos of The New Yorker -- Not everyone signed on to her candidacy right away. Obama released a statement voicing confidence in \"a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges.\" The former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and the House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries praised Biden while conspicuously saying nothing about a successor. But, around the country, activists who favored Harris were coordinating. Mini Timmaraju, a delegate to the Convention and the head of the abortion-rights group Reproductive Freedom for All, told me, \"My phone was ringing off the hook from people, like, 'Women of color, we've got to stand together for Vice President Harris. If they don't consolidate around the Vice President, we're going to create trouble.' \" Harris called Timmaraju from her table to ask her to pledge support. \"I was so excited, I was, like, 'Yes! Hell yes,' \" Timmaraju recalled. Several Democrats who might have challenged her, including Whitmer, Shapiro, and Mark Kelly, the Senator from Arizona, had promised their support. Aides estimated that they'd have pledges from a majority of Convention delegates within forty-eight hours.\"Where do never Trumpers go from here?\" via Kevin D. Williamson of The Wall Street Journal -- The Lifers, for their part, are either going to go into internal exile following a Trump victory in November or fight what's left of the Trumpists following a Trump defeat. In the latter case, the Trumpists will still be led by Trump, who will simply insist that the election was illegitimate, and the Lifers will lose again. Mitt Romney, Lifer-in-Chief, is an intelligent and patriotic man, but his argument for withholding his endorsement of Harris -- that he wants to retain his influence in the GOP -- is straight-up delusional.\"Joe Gruters fact-checks recreational pot critics in new statewide ad\" via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics -- A new campaign ad promoting a recreational marijuana amendment fact-checks critics -- and does so with a Republican leader's voice. Sen. Gruters, a Sarasota Republican, looks to the camera in \"Blowing Smoke,\" a 30-second Smart & Safe Florida Campaign ad. The former Republican Party of Florida Chair takes on several accusations, many of them made by DeSantis, about what Amendment 3 would mean for Florida if it passes. \"I led the fight to ban smoking on Florida's public beaches,\" Gruters says, \"so trust me, these attacks about Amendment 3 are just blowing smoke.\" Gruters spent years on legislation that ultimately authorized local governments to regulate cigarette smoking in public parks. in question: A woman with brain cancer is shown in a 30-second ad describing how she found out she had a brain tumor while pregnant with her second child. \"The doctors knew that if I did not end my pregnancy, I would lose my baby. I would lose my life. And my daughter would lose her mom,\" the Tampa woman says in the ad.\"Poll: Debbie Mucarsel-Powell trails Rick Scott by just 2 points\" via Jesse Scheckner of Florida Politics -- Yet another survey shows that Democrat Mucarsel-Powell has a shot at unseating Republican U.S. Sen. Scott next month. Pollsters found the former Congresswoman trails Scott by just 2 percentage points, which is more or less what a few other queries determined in recent months. Marist Poll spoke to 1,510 Florida adults Oct. 3-7 by phone, text and online. Of them, 1,257 say they are definitely voting in this year's General Election. As of last week, 50% of likely voters statewide -- including those undecided yet leaning toward a candidate -- say they intend to vote for Scott, while 48% side with Mucarsel-Powell. That 2-percentage-point divide is well within the poll's 3.6-point margin of error.Vivek Ramaswamy bolsters Scott GOTV effort in Palm Beach -- Ramaswamy led a rally in Palm Beach over the weekend urging voters to turn out for Trump, Scott and Republicans up and down the ballot. \"One place where we start by getting it right is not just by sending any old Senator back to Senate, but by sending one of the great lions of the U.S. Senate back to serve his state and his country. This man does not have to be doing it; he's doing it because he wants to make a sacrifice for our country in our hour of need. And that's your current and next Senator - Rick Scott,\" Ramaswamy said at the rally.\"Did Milton just turn FEMA funding into a deciding issue in Florida's federal elections?\" via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics -- Several Florida congressional delegation members want Congress back in Washington to approve new funding for Milton relief. That includes several lawmakers who voted against a budget deal last month to keep the government open. That may be a sign of how the hurricane could impact the political climate in Florida ahead of the election just as storm surge has reshaped the state's coast. Lawmakers representing regions especially hurt by the storm, which made landfall Wednesday as a Category 3 hurricane, voiced a willingness, and in some cases an expressed desire, to return to Washington and approve extra funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.-- \"How the hurricanes could impact voting, according to a post-Sandy official\" via Madison Fernandez of POLITICO\"Taking on Brian Mast: Why this 25-year-old is running for U.S. Congress\" via Joel Engelhardt of Stet News -- There he is, exhorting the crowd, introducing the Democratic U.S. Senate candidate, pushing back against state plans for golf courses at Jonathan Dickinson State Park. The easygoing, sharp-eyed young man sounds like a veteran of political campaigns as he lambastes his rival or tosses off obscure policy points. But he's billed as the youngest congressional candidate in the country, as young as one can get and still be eligible to run for Congress. Democrat Thomas Witkop of Palm Beach Gardens is 25 and taking on seasoned U.S. Rep. Mast, an eight-year incumbent in a predominantly Republican district. Witkop isn't just running against Mast; he's attacking the decorated Afghan war veteran on one of his perceived strengths: the environment.\"'Very much a pragmatist.' Maria Elvira Salazar threads a needle as she seeks re-election\" via Max Greenwood and Syra Ortiz Blanes of the Miami Herald -- As the Republican Party's rank and file have embraced increasingly conservative positions on issues like immigration, government spending and abortion access, Salazar is performing a high-wire balancing act as she seeks another term in Congress. The Miami congresswoman boasted about federal funding for her district, which she voted against. She has kept her distance from a fight over Florida's six-week abortion ban and a proposed constitutional amendment that would override it. And she has elevated the issue of immigration reform and amnesty - while also defending Trump as \"the only guy who could fix\" the country's immigration system.\"As Florida reels from Milton, DeSantis again dismisses the role of climate change\" via Clarissa-Jan Lim of MSNBC -- With the severity of damage from Milton in Florida becoming clearer, DeSantis once again dismissed the impact of climate change. \"It is hurricane season. You are going to have tropical weather,\" the Republican said Thursday in St. Lucie County, which was hit hard by deadly tornadoes. DeSantis also seemed to equate hurricane-related conspiracy theories -- which authorities say are causing real harm -- with scientists pointing out that human activity drives climate change. When asked to respond to the disinformation swirling around the hurricanes, the Governor joked: \"Look, if I could control the weather, I would do, you know, 78 and sunny year-round.\"s run by a political committee that supports the ballot initiative, known as Amendment 4. The letter drew criticism from the Federal Communications Commission Chair, who called the letter \"dangerous\" and a likely violation of the First Amendment.AHCA denies license to Pensacola abortion clinic -- Bucking the recommendation of an administrative law judge, the Agency for Health Care Administration denied a license for a new abortion clinic in Pensacola. The licensure application was submitted by July Medical Services, which operates as Hope Medical of Pensacola. Last year, the organization sought a hearing before an administrative law judge after AHCA indicated it would deny the license. AHCA Secretary Jason Weida's final order denying the license pointed to a \"pattern of deficient performance\" at a since-closed Louisiana clinic tied to the organization seeking to operate in Pensacola. The administrative law judge who recommended approval said underlying violations were mostly \"non-repeated offenses\" and should not be grounds for denial.\"Florida Citrus Mutual CEO says citrus crop forecast for 2024-2025 season is 'extremely discouraging'\" via Amber Jo Cooper of Florida's Voice -- Florida Citrus Mutual CEO Matt Joyner said the citrus crop forecast for the 2024-2025 season is \"extremely discouraging\" following the release of new data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Friday. The announcement said the forecast does not reflect damage from the recent hurricane. The USDA estimates production to be 15 million boxes of oranges, 1.4 million boxes of grapefruit, and 200,000 boxes of tangerines and tangelos this season. The forecast for boxes of oranges is nearly 3 million boxes less than last year. Florida Citrus Mutual, the state's largest citrus grower organization, said citrus production is currently at \"just a fraction\" of what it was in the 1990s. The company said in the 1997-1998 harvest season, 244 million boxes of oranges were produced.\"Scott tours flooded homes along St. Johns River; says FEMA funding on the way\" via Brenno Carillo of The Daytona Beach News-Journal -- Sen. Scott, accompanied by Volusia and Lake County officials, was in Astor Saturday afternoon to survey areas along the St. Johns River that, after Milton, are facing the threat of more flooding in the next few days. Scott and officials arrived via helicopter at the Astor Boat Ramp on Front Street, where they stepped onto a Volusia Sheriff's Office boat for a brief ride past the Astor Bridge and back, looking at the flooded riverfront properties, which will likely see waters rise even more. \"Unfortunately, what we're seeing here is a lot of flooding,\" Scott said. Area neighborhoods were hit with severe flooding from this week's storm, with homes seeing almost 1 foot of intruding waters.\"Vern Buchanan, Kathy Castor lead request to Biden for expedited Milton declaration\" via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics -- U.S. Reps. Buchanan and Castor are leading a letter urging Biden to expedite Milton relief. The Longboat Key Republican and Tampa Democrat represent districts heavily impacted by the Category 3 hurricane. Their letter supports a request from DeSantis for Biden to expedite a major disaster declaration. \"As you are undoubtedly aware, Florida has experienced three hurricanes in as many months -- two of which have been major hurricanes -- causing significant damage across much of the state,\" the letter reads. \"In fact, Hurricane Milton made landfall on parts of Florida's coastline that had already suffered from unprecedented storm surge from Hurricane Helene and claimed the lives of 25 Floridians just two weeks ago.\"\"Trump-backing billionaires are trying to buy a prosecutor in Palm Beach\" via Jason Garcia of Seeking Rents -- A trio of Trump-backing billionaires just put half a million dollars into the Florida election that will decide the next top prosecutor in Trump's home county. The sudden cash infusion appears to finance television ads promoting Republican Sam Stern, a white-collar criminal defense lawyer running for State Attorney in Palm Beach County. His chief opponent is Democrat Alexcia Cox, a deputy chief assistant to current State Attorney Dave Aronberg, a Democrat who is not seeking re-election. Palm Beach County is home to many of Florida's wealthiest and most influential residents -- including Trump.\"Alina Garcia nears $500K raised for Miami-Dade SOE job -- 4 times more than her Dem foe\" via Jesse Scheckner of Florida Politics -- Miami Republican Rep. Garcia is close to crossing the $500,000 mark in her bid to become Miami-Dade County's first voter-chosen Supervisor of Elections. Her Democratic opponent, former state Rep. J.C. Planas, raised about a quarter of that sum while still outspending her through late September. Between Aug. 16 and Sept. 20, the last date from which state and county campaign finance data was available Thursday, Garcia collected about $60,000 between her campaign account and political committee, Florida Always First. Between the time she won her House seat in November 2022 and Sept. 20, Garcia -- a longtime GOP operative -- amassed more than $492,000.\"Broward ethics rules may be relaxed on accepting gifts of food and drinks\" via Lisa J. Huriash of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel -- Broward County Commissioners will consider relaxing the rules surrounding accepting gifts of food and drinks when on the job. State law caps require elected officials who accept $100 or more worth of food and drinks from a non-relative to be reported, as well as vendor and lobbyist gifts between $25 and $100. Gifts of food and drinks are capped at $100 from lobbyists and vendors. The idea is to prohibit \"sizable gifts that may invite actual or perceived impropriety,\" according to county records. But Broward's ethics code takes the spirit of the law further, and it prohibits elected officials from accepting any gift with a value that exceeds $5 from a lobbyist, vendor, or contractor. There is, however, an exception for soft drinks. Commissioner Mark Bogen proposes modifying those rules for Broward elected officials, creating a $25 cap on soft drinks, which would include any food given at the same time. That also means raising the maximum on food from $5 to $25.Meanwhile ... \"Eric Trump is now a Deputy Sheriff in St. Lucie County\" via Jesse Scheckner of Florida Politics -- Trump now carries a badge -- and the authority to make arrests -- in St. Lucie County. On Tuesday, as Milton bore down on Florida's Gulf Coast, St. Lucie Sheriff Keith Pearson swore in Donald Trump's second-eldest son as a Special Deputy. Eric Trump posted several pictures to Instagram announcing his appointment, one of which showed him taking an oath of duty in front of a sniper rifle not unlike the one that took out his father's would-be assassin three months ago. \"I have always wanted to become a Sheriff!\" Trump wrote in the post that it had received more than 122,000 likes by Friday afternoon.\"One Orlando-area man died in Milton. Here's his story.\" via Silas Morgan of the Orlando Sentinel -- Hap Hopkins died while cleaning up his yard after Milton. The Orange County man is believed to be the only Orlando metropolitan area fatality of Milton, which killed 18 across the state. A statement from the sheriff's office said his body was found in his yard northwest of Orlando, where he apparently stepped on a downed power line while clearing debris. Hopkins, a native of Central Florida, spent decades working for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. According to his LinkedIn profile, he was a retired crime lab analyst supervisor at the agency's Orlando office, where he managed day-to-day operations of the Forensic Biology/DNA Section. He was interviewed about a cold case where improved DNA testing and technology led to the arrest of the suspect in a 1991 Orlando rape.Disney World got hit with 70 mph winds during Milton\" via Gabrielle Russon of Florida Politics -- Milton blew 70 mph gusts at Disney World's Animal Kingdom and 87 mph gusts at the Orlando International Airport, Orange County officials said Thursday, adding that there are no reported deaths in the county from the storm. \"We will not know about the extent of the damage until we have the opportunity to go out and further investigate. However, we know again that approximately 600 properties were damaged,\" Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings said during a Thursday news conference. Some of Orange County's west side got hit with 12 inches of rain. The hurricane caused 42 tornado warnings and several confirmed touchdowns in Central Florida. Demings said he received a phone call from Biden offering to help. Demings also credited Florida's Division of Emergency Management for helping the county's emergency operations.\"Garden Theatre: 'No funds available' for refunds\" via Matthew J. Palm of the Orlando Sentinel -- The shuttered Garden Theatre in Winter Garden has slammed the door on patrons hoping for refunds, saying there are \"no funds available.\" Meanwhile, a parent of a student involved in the Garden's youth production of \"The Little Mermaid\" has raised thousands toward making sure that show goes on, a local theater-education program has taken in homeschooled children that were part of Garden program, and a local theater producer has expressed interest in reopening the venue. No one from the Board of Directors of Garden Theatre Inc. -- the nonprofit that ran the city-owned building -- has publicly spoken about the abrupt Oct. 2 closing or responded to Orlando Sentinel requests for comment.\"4 illegal gambling casino operations nailed in state and local bust on Space Coast\" via Drew Dixon of Florida Politics -- Four illegal gambling casinos were nailed in Brevard County this month after a joint investigation by state officials and the Brevard County Sheriff's Office. The Florida Gaming Control Commission assisted in the probe with the Sheriff's investigators, who confiscated 146 illegal slot machines and about $195,000 in cash. \"We are grateful for the partnership we have with the Brevard County Sheriff's Office and the continued attention on investigating and shutting down these predatory illegal casinos,\" said Lou Trombetta, Executive Director of the Florida Gaming Control Commission.What Kevin King is reading -- \"DeSantis says St. Petersburg crane developer should've used more 'common sense'\" via Emily L. Mahoney and Romy Ellenbogen of the Tampa Bay Times -- Standing in front of the crumbled wreckage of a downtown high-rise smashed by a fallen crane, DeSantis said the developer responsible should have used more \"common sense\" to take down heavy equipment before Milton arrived. He made the remarks following a news conference in which state officials provided updates about Milton recovery. A reporter asked whether there should be more government regulation of cranes during extreme weather. \"I mean, do we have to regulate everything?\" DeSantis said, adding that he thought taking cranes down during storms was \"standard practice.\" \"Do you really have to really, like, crackdown from the state to do it? I would hope not, and I think most of the time in Florida that is handled very appropriately but I think it takes a little bit of common sense,\" he said.\"Milton: Floodwaters kill New Port Richey woman, trap neighbors in their homes\" via Elena Barrera of the Tallahassee Democrat -- Residents in the Park Lake Estates neighborhood have been trapped in their homes for four days. Almost everyone's home was perfectly fine after Milton -- they never even lost power. But floodwaters from the Anclote River rose to deadly heights -- at least 3 feet deep in some places -- leaving numerous roads impassable for anyone without a taller car, truck, or the guts to try. Earlier, according to the Florida Highway Patrol, an 82-year-old man of Bushnell was driving a Toyota Corolla around 1:35 a.m. along Black Fox Drive with an 88-year-old woman of New Port Richey in the passenger seat. As the two turned onto Sawgrass Boulevard, \"the vehicle traveled into a pond and became submerged,\" FHP said. The man had minor injuries, but the woman didn't survive the accident.\"'Nobody came': Tampa Bay seniors go days without power after Milton\" via Shauna Muckle and Justin Garcia of the Tampa Bay Times -- At two complexes in downtown St. Petersburg and one in Sun City Center in southern Hillsborough County, seniors, many with disabilities, have gone days without power. Although Pinellas County prioritizes assisted living facilities and nursing homes for power restoration, a Duke Energy spokesperson said, independent living facilities, where seniors can live on their own, aren't prioritized. That quickly becomes a problem for otherwise independent seniors who rely on elevators, chargers for motorized wheelchairs, oxygen tanks and refrigeration for lifesaving medications. At 540 Town Center on 2nd Ave. S., some residents hadn't felt fresh air on their faces since Tuesday. The elevators had stopped working, trapping wheelchair-bound seniors in their stifling apartments. \"For older people like us, it's like hell\" to be without power, Barbara Robison said. She sat wearily on the curb Saturday, overnight bags packed. She just wanted a hot shower at her son's place.\"Decisions on reopening Tampa Bay schools pushed to Monday\" via Jeffrey S. Solochek of the Tampa Bay Times -- Tampa Bay families will have to wait a bit longer to find out when their children will return to school. Area districts had already announced that they won't hold classes on Monday. Now Hillsborough, Pasco and Pinellas leaders say they would alert families and employees about Tuesday's status by noon Monday. That will give them enough time to determine whether they have power at schools and make needed repairs. \"We are still assessing schools, dealing with rising water in some locations,\" Pasco superintendent Kurt Browning said. \"We have probably a dozen schools still without power and (are) trying to deal with impossible roads to get kids to school.\" Hillsborough spokesperson Tanya Arja said much of Monday will be spent cleaning up debris on the district's campuses. As they work to resume normal operations, the Pinellas and Hillsborough districts on Sunday closed the shelters that had been operating inside schools. Pasco shuttered its last remaining school shelter on Saturday.\"Jacksonville's approach to state homeless law will lead to court battles\" via A.G. Gancarski for Jacksonville Today -- Death and taxes are usually held up as the avatars of inevitability, but right beside them are unintended consequences from Florida laws. Exhibit A: HB 1365, affecting Jacksonville and other cities in this market, banning public camping and sleeping. Lawmakers approved it during this year's Legislative Session, and it's been in effect since the first of this month. Is Jacksonville complying? Sorta kinda. The idea of social services aside, the state law is intended to be punitive: to drive localities to get homeless people off the streets and into a centralized location. Jacksonville's model elides the \"discipline and punish\" motif though, raising questions about how compliant the local model is with the state intent.\"Effort to rename Confederate Street after late activist fails in Jacksonville City Council\" via Casmira Harrison of Jacksonville Today -- In a 10-7 vote, Jacksonville's City Council decided against renaming the Springfield street after the late local civil rights activist Ben Frazier. Confederate Street spans just 0.2 miles, leading to the former Confederate Park -- since renamed Springfield Park -- where bronze Confederate statues once stood. Mayor Donna Deegan removed the last of those statues last year, six months after the death of one of their most vocal detractors, the 73-year-old Frazier. He died of cancer in June 2023. During the meeting, Kelly Frazier, the late activist's daughter, predicted that the legislation to honor her father would fail.Congrats -- Wolfson Children's Hospital in Jacksonville has once again been ranked among the best in the nation by U.S. News & World Report in their 2024-2025 \"Best Children's Hospitals\" survey. Wolfson earned national recognition in four specialties: Cancer, Diabetes & Endocrinology, Neurology & Neurosurgery, and Pediatric & Adolescent Behavioral Health. \"To be ranked in four different specialties this year is a testament to the skill and expertise of both our clinical team and our long-standing partners,\" said Allegra C. Jaros, President of Wolfson Children's Hospital. This recognition reflects the hospital's dedication to providing cutting-edge, specialized care in collaboration with Nemours Children's Health and the University of Florida College of Medicine - Jacksonville. Wolfson's continued focus on pediatric care, including a recent behavioral health expansion, underscores its role as a critical health care provider for children in North Florida and beyond.\"Captiva, South Seas hit hard by Milton's surge, wind: 'This is just tragic'\" via Chad Gillis of The Fort Myers News-Press -- Betsy Ventura walked along the beach in front of the fallen Mucky Duck restaurant, assessing the damage to her home island. A resident of this area since 1984, Ventura is no rookie when it comes to hurricane losses, but this one took out her business: YOLO Watersports. She and her family fled to LaBelle during Milton, only to return to a ravaged barrier island. \"It's tough,\" she said. She said the family hopes to repair the business and her mother's home soon. Captiva beaches are bare as all the sand has been pushed up and into the community. South Seas at the north end of Captiva was ravaged by Milton as trees, debris, and personal items were scattered through the mangrove canopy across the street. Dumpsters were piled up behind restaurants on Captiva, and a cottage near the bayside of the island was still smoldering from a fire that broke out during Milton. The smell of burned wood mixed with the afternoon breeze as dump trucks hauled sand around the island. Homes at the north end of the island were almost blanketed by the sand.\"Receipt shows Sheriff Carmine Marceno received $9K piano from same LCSO 'ghost employee' alleging kickback scheme\" via Bob Norman of the Florida Trident -- For Marceno, jeweler Ken Romano was more than a close friend and gambling buddy -- he was a \"brother.\" \"My brother Kenny,\" Marceno wrote on a campaign poster for Romano framed on the wall of his jewelry store in Bonita Springs. \"Thank you for all you do! You are the Best!\" According to Romano, it's true -- he did a lot for the Sheriff. In an audio recording, Romano claimed Marceno owes him a quarter million dollars after he paid off gambling debts for the Sheriff and gave him expensive gifts, including a $40,000 ring for Marceno's late grandmother. The Sheriff can be seen on a surveillance video accepting a large stack of cash from Romano inside his store.\"Florida has taken steps to shore up its insurance market, but big risks still loom\" via Peter Coy of The New York Times -- Milton would have done more damage if it had made landfall a few dozen miles farther north. It was Florida's fourth stroke of (relatively) good luck. Property damage from Hurricanes Idalia last year and Debby and Helene this year was also less than it might have been because they hit hardest in the lightly populated Big Bend, where the Panhandle meets the peninsula.Still, the Florida peninsula sticks out like a sore thumb into waters that keep getting warmer, brewing up fiercer and fiercer hurricanes. It's only a matter of time until a monster storm does hit Tampa-St. Petersburg or Miami or another major metro area dead-on.Getting insurance right in Florida isn't the whole solution, but it's a big one. When the insurance market is working correctly, losses are shared. Nobody gets financially wiped out. Also, the premiums people pay are based on the risks they face. This gets incentives right: People are motivated to harden their homes against storms or move out of harm's way, which obviously helps them but also reduces costs for society as a whole.But getting there isn't easy. Climate change has made living in Florida riskier, but when insurance companies try to charge fair premiums, they receive strong pushback. Nationally, the flood insurance market is so dysfunctional that the federal government has had to take over most of it. And that's not working, either. Rates are still subsidized, though less than before, so taxpayers who live high and dry are potentially on the hook for losses by people who get flooded out, in some cases repeatedly.So, what to do? While Florida can't control the weather, there are things that it can do to reduce the economic damage that storms cause. It has done some of them, but there are still weaknesses in the system -- and according to one recent study, a devastating hurricane in Florida could ripple all the way to the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.-- OPINIONS --\"After two ferocious storms, making peace with Florida\" via Stephanie Hayes of the Tampa Bay Times -- Driving across Florida in the middle of the night after a hurricane, that's one way to make peace with your God. Or start to try. My husband and I look up from our evacuation hotel in West Palm Beach after the storm and know, in a deep, bone-and-soul kind of way, that we can't stay one minute longer. We have to cut a line through this state and get home to whatever chaos Helene and Milton have double-teamed along Florida's west coast. We pack our cruddy room faster than Tony and Carmela Soprano pull weapons and cash out of a ceiling. Florida, man. What does anyone know about this state? We are a little off. But we're not so off that we should perpetually be regarded as some kind of petting zoo goats. The national media does not have to zoom in obsessively on the few leathery oldsters who refuse to leave their boats, the drunk dudes goofing in rising waters, the big city reporters getting clobbered with flying debris. None of it helps our case here. You see, now the kooks have started saying Florida is being targeted by the government, a government that is ... creating weather disasters? To wipe out voting blocs and progressive urban planning, I guess?\"How Harris can finish strong\" via David Brooks of The New York Times -- The playwright David Mamet once wrote a memo to a group of fellow writers in which he reminded them that audiences \"will not tune in to watch information.\" They will \"only tune in and stay tuned to watch drama.\" What is drama? Mamet says it \"is the quest of the hero to overcome those things which prevent him from achieving a specific, acute goal.\" The screenwriter Aaron Sorkin builds on that definition. He says that strong drama is built around intention and obstacle. The hero has to be seized by a strong, specific desire, and she needs to face a really big obstacle. That suggests that Harris needs to show the American people her most vital, most acute and controlling desire, the ruling passion of her soul. It's unclear what Harris wants most deeply, other than the vague chance to do good and to be President. You don't communicate your deepest desire when your campaign is run by a committee.\"Why is Trump gaining with Black and Hispanic voters?\" via Nate Cohn of The New York Times -- Like our other surveys this cycle, the polls find Trump faring unusually well for a Republican among Black and Hispanic voters. Overall, Harris is ahead, 78% to 15%, among Black voters, and she's leading, 56-37, among Hispanic voters. Almost any way we can measure it, Trump is running as well or better among Black and Hispanic voters as any Republican in recent memory. In 2020, Biden's Black support was 92% among major-party voters; his Hispanic support was 63%, according to Times estimates. The poll offers plenty of insight into Mr. Trump's strengths and Ms. Harris's weaknesses, but it does not offer a simple, definitive answer. This may be unsatisfying, but it should not be surprising. The truth is there are many explanations and they're hard to untangle.\"Amendment 3 is about much more than pot\" via Kevin Sabet for the Miami Herald -- This November, Florida will vote on the legalization of marijuana and THC drugs. The initiative is a choice between allowing a corporate monopoly to make billions marketing drugs to kids or protecting public health and safety. Floridians must stand against more drugs in their communities and oppose Amendment 3. Trulieve, the biggest marijuana corporation in the United States, is desperate for legalization in its home state of Florida. In fact, Trulieve has spent more than $75 million to support its pro-drug campaign, making the measure the most expensive in American history. That's because Amendment 3 is written as if it were solely for Trulieve's benefit.\"Ashley Moody keeps finding ways to be wrong\" via the South Florida Sun-Sentinel editorial board -- Conspicuously, offensively, inexcusably, historically wrong. She refuses to defend a Florida law that prohibits open carry of firearms. It's under attack in a federal lawsuit filed to bypass state courts. Moody is the gun lobby's biggest elected shill in Florida since former Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam took pride in being labeled an \"NRA sellout.\" She dispatched a deputy to a federal court in Louisiana at our expense to argue in favor of Texas' book ban. She didn't just sign a friend-of-the-court brief with other right-wing Republican state attorneys general. She got her man a slot in the oral argument schedule. Open carry is too toxic even for most Florida legislators. They have seen enough images from other states of people in camo and tactical vests walking around with Glocks on their hips and assault weapons on their shoulders. Such chilling encounters are coming our way if Moody has anything to do with it.\"Miami Herald endorses 'independent thinker' Vicki Lopez for re-election\" via Miami Herald editorial board -- The District 113 race is among the most competitive Florida House elections on the November ballot in Miami-Dade. Whoever represents the district needs to reach across the aisle. That's why incumbent Lopez, a Republican, deserves re-election in the contest with Democrat Jackie Gross-Kellogg. Lopez calls herself an \"independent thinker.\" She voted against the state's six-week abortion ban and Republican laws that take away local home rule, such as a bill that banned local minimum wage requirements and rules on heat protections for outdoor workers. She criticized the Legislature's trend of taking power from local communities and DeSantis' recent cuts to arts and culture programs that she said fuel local economies. We encourage Gross-Kellogg to remain involved in advocacy and politics. But the incumbent in this race has built an impressive record.\"Disney-themed bullet train starts magical journey in Japan\" via Kyodo News -- A Disney-themed shinkansen (bullet train) has begun operation for a limited time as part of a collaboration between JR East and Oriental Land, the operator of Tokyo Disney Resort. The companies said this marks the first time an E5 series shinkansen has been fully wrapped in a unique design. Passengers can immerse themselves in the Disney world inside the carriages with themed melodies and curtains. The train began service on Thursday, following a departure ceremony at JR Sendai Station in northeastern Japan. It will run about three times daily on the Tohoku-Hokkaido Shinkansen line, connecting Tokyo and Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto stations, until early June 2025.",

Saan stated that NasDem's decision was driven by a sense of self-awareness of their position.\"Well, that's why ethically NasDem is self-aware,\" said Saan when met at the Senayan parliamentary complex, Central Jakarta, on Monday, October 14, 2024.The party led by Surya Paloh is not a member of the Forward Indonesia Coalition (KIM) that supports Prabowo-Gibran in the 2024 Presidential Election. NasDem chose to support Anies Baswedan and Abdul Muhaimin Iskandar.He mentioned that NasDem prioritizes ministerial positions for political parties that have supported Prabowo from the beginning. \"(NasDem) gives the opportunity for coalition parties supporting Mr. Prabowo-Mr. Gibran to fill positions in the cabinet,\" said Saan.This is despite NasDem having declared their support for Prabowo-Gibran after being declared the winners of the Presidential Election. \"So, again, this is more about ethics and appropriateness, because indeed NasDem is not a supporting party,\" he said.The Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives stated that it would be inappropriate if their party got involved in quarrels over the cabinet and requested empty seats. He mentioned that those seats are more deserving to be filled by the coalition.\"So, if NasDem were to get involved in quarrels over the cabinet, it would seem inappropriate, right? Asking for this, asking for that. So, we are more in a self-aware position, like that,\" Saan said.",

    "content": "The BDN Opinion section operates independently and does not set news policies or contribute to reporting or editing articles elsewhere in the newspaper or on bangordailynews.comRon Sweet has been an educator in Maine for more than 30 years.The 2024 presidential election is neck and neck. Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are essentially tied, with Harris favored to win the popular vote. The race will come down to the all important swing states where the race will be decided by the Electoral College. It is projected Trump will win between 43 percent and 49 percent of the popular vote.For me, this raises a serious question: What does this tell us about ourselves as a country when a convicted felon (unanimous on 34 counts), a racist who doesn't try to hide it, and a misogynist (\"When you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\") can be a viable candidate in a presidential election?Further, Trump is a candidate with few political views. If one remembers correctly, the Republican Party had no platform in 2020 -- it was whatever Trump said it was.The few views that Trump espouses are in my opinion morally bankrupt and unethical. These include attacking immigrants and promising to deport 20,000 Haitians (legal immigrants) from Springfield, Ohio. Why? Because it is always easier to blame a minority group for the woes of the country. Trump and his running mate JD Vance repeatedly say that the immigrants are eating cats and dogs, taking jobs and housing and murdering Americans. These are all lies that the MAGA base rallies behind. For example, statistics show that violent crime among immigrants is much lower than among the general public.Trump promises to pass another tax cut similar to the one passed in 2017. In other words, another tax cut for the wealthy and rich corporations, which will increase the national debt another $4 trillion.Trump promises to end the Ukraine war in one day. This will likely be done by forcing Ukraine to sign a treaty that they do not want and at the same time giving Russian President Vladimir Putin everything he wants. Trump loves dictators and the one he seems to love most is Putin.Trump will continue to attack women's health care by taking away their right to choose. More women will die.It seems we have not learned anything from Trump's previous tenure in office. Remember Trump's response to COVID. First denying it existed, then blaming the Chinese (Trump always has someone else to blame), then saying perhaps we could eradicate the disease by \"getting light inside the body\" or by cleansing internal organs with disinfectant. Trump's Coronavirus Response Coordinator Deborah Birx told Congress in 2022 that with a better response to COVID, more than 130,000 Americans could have been saved in the initial phase of the pandemic.Remember Trump's response to losing the 2020 election after losing over 60 court cases. First came the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. capitol after Vice President Mike Pence decided to certify the election results against Trump's demands. Remember the rioters chanting, \"Hang Mike Pence\" and Trump's response of, \"So what?\" Trump later claimed that it was a peaceful demonstration yet caused $1.5 million in damages to the capitol building and 140 police officers were assaulted. Over 450 members of the Jan. 6 mob have been sentenced to jail terms. Lastly, remember what J.D. Vance said about Trump in 2016: He called Trump \"America's Hitler.\"It is important to remember that Trump uses his favorite topic, immigration, as a talking point to divide Americans. He has no desire to solve this problem. Immigration is red meat to throw to his base. Earlier this year, Congress was making progress on a bipartisan comprehensive bill on immigration but Trump interfered and told Republicans to shut the bill down. He had no desire to solve the problem. He needed immigration as a campaign issue.In conclusion, many people support Trump because of his promise of easy solutions. For immigrants it's deportation. On trade it's 10 percent tariffs. For Ukraine, it's bend the knee to Putin. We all love easy, simple, quick solutions. Problem is, these are complex issues requiring complex solutions. Would Trump deal with these complex problems the same way that he dealt with COVID?So, I go back to my original question: What does 45 percent support for Trump tell us about our country? I can't answer that but whatever it is, it isn't good.",

    "title": "Migrations to Swing States Could Decide the US Election 2024 - NewsVoice",
    "content": "NewsVoice is an online news and debate channel that started in 2011. The purpose is to publish independent news, debate articles and comments as well as analyzes.Elon Musk expressed concerns during an interview with Tucker Carlson that if Donald Trump does not win the 2024 election, it could be the last meaningful election in the U.S. He claims that Democrats are bringing in large numbers of undocumented immigrants through a secretive, illegal process, particularly to swing states.Musk suggested that this influx could significantly alter voting outcomes, as many of these individuals would eventually gain citizenship and vote predominantly for Democrats.He warned that this could lead to a permanent Democratic majority, turning the U.S. into a one-party system, similar to how California shifted strongly Democratic after immigration changes in the 1980s.Newsweek writes that Arizona, long considered a swing state, has undergone a significant demographic shift that could influence the outcome of the 2024 U.S. elections. A large influx of Californians, many of whom bring more progressive political views, is reshaping the state's political landscape.This trend may impact the tight races for both the presidency and key congressional seats, such as the U.S. Senate.In the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election, Arizona has emerged as a key battleground state, and the influx of Californians moving there could prove decisive. According to recent U.S. Census data, over 74,000 Californians relocated to Arizona in 2022 alone, and their impact on the state's political balance may help Vice President Kamala Harris secure a critical win in the Grand Canyon State.In 2020, President Joe Biden narrowly beat Donald Trump in Arizona by fewer than 11,000 votes, signaling a shift in a state that had long been a Republican stronghold.Arizona had previously voted for Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016 and against Barack Obama in both of his presidential campaigns. But in recent years, Arizona's political landscape has shifted dramatically, with Democrats making significant gains.In 2010, Republicans held both of Arizona's U.S. Senate seats, a supermajority in the state legislature, and every statewide office. Today, Democrats hold the governor, attorney general, and secretary of state positions. Both state senators were elected on Democratic tickets, although Senator Kyrsten Sinema later switched to run as an independent.As Sinema steps aside, Californian migrants could also impact Arizona's upcoming Senate race. Polls show Democrat Ruben Gallego leading Republican Kari Lake, with the newcomers from California potentially giving Democrats an edge.Mark Shanahan, an expert in U.S. presidential politics at the University of Surrey, believes this influx of Californians has played a key role in making Arizona more competitive for Democrats. Speaking to Newsweek, Shanahan explained how the demographic shift has influenced voting patterns.\"The influx of Californians to Arizona isn't homogenous,\" Shanahan noted.\"They cut across age boundaries from young tech workers through agricultural laborers to retirees. But they are more likely to have a history of voting Democrat, or at least be anti-Trump, and willing to be swayed towards Harris over Trump and Gallego over Lake.\"Shanahan also pointed out that most new residents from California tend to settle in Phoenix and Tucson, urban areas that have become Democratic strongholds. Meanwhile, rural parts of the state remain firmly Republican.\"Relatively few thousand new Democrat votes could make all the difference in a very tightly contested race,\" he added.Dafydd Townley, a lecturer in American politics at the University of Portsmouth, emphasized that while migration may play a role, other issues -- particularly abortion -- are likely to be more influential.\"There is an assumption that those migrating to Arizona will be Democrats, however, California does have pockets of strong Republican voters that might be included in those leaving the Golden State,\" Townley told Newsweek. \"It's unlikely that the electoral votes for Arizona will be decided on this one factor.\"Arizona voters are expected to decide whether to protect abortion rights within the State Constitution, a move that could galvanize voters on both sides of the issue.A recent AARP poll of 600 likely Arizona voters showed Trump leading Harris by just two points, with 49 percent of respondents backing the former president versus 47 percent for the vice president. The poll, conducted in late September, has a four-point margin of error, suggesting the race is still up for grabs.The race for Arizona, once a Republican bastion, is poised to be one of the most closely watched contests in the 2024 election. Whether Californian migrants or pressing social issues will sway the outcome remains to be seen. Still, the state's new political landscape guarantees it will be a crucial battleground for both parties.",

    "title": "How liberals and conservatives can have better conversations, according to a psychologist",
    "content": "A psychologist has explained the sources of political beliefs in the U.S., why liberalism and conservatism appeal to different individuals and why we continue to disagree about fundamental issues in American life.New York, U.S./Oxford, UK, October 14, 2024 - As the 2024 US Presidential Election in November inches closer, the partisan divide in American society has never felt more apparent - or pervasive.From workplace chatter to heated discussions at family gatherings, many Americans may have asked themselves, 'How can I make this person understand me? How can I better take control of political debates when they arise?'These questions sit right at the center of a new book, Bridging Our Political Divide: How Liberals and Conservatives Can Understand Each Other and Find Common Ground, by Kenneth Barish.The Clinical Professor of Psychology teaches us how to listen, think, and speak about our political opinions in a way that allows us to understand each other's concerns, resist false dichotomies and ideological certainty, see new perspectives and possibilities, and find common ground.He explains: \"We are more likely to be open-minded when new facts are presented in the context of dialogue; when we feel that our needs and feelings have been acknowledged; if we feel respected; and when we are less afraid... For coming closer together, we need to cultivate this openness, to the extent possible.\"What does it mean to be 'liberal' or 'conservative'?The existence of these oppositional political beliefs is far from new. Barish, who is a Fellow of the American Psychological Association, offers a brief history as a way of understanding our current political divide.In Roman politics, the Optimates (\"best men\") believed in preserving tradition while the Populares (\"favoring the people\") proposed welfare programs and the expansion of citizenship rights.Although presented in changed forms, these early conflicts form the basis of liberalism and conservatism today. Conservative political ideas can be understood as maintaining the existing social order and reacting to perceived threats. Meanwhile, liberalism is described as a belief in humane social reform and questioning established authority.He explains: \"The greater the perceived threat or excess, the more impassioned the conservative reaction; in a similar way, the greater the perceived cruelty or injustice, the more impassioned the liberal desire for change.\"How these polar attitudes can presentOne of Bridging Our Political Divide's key arguments is that these political attitudes are not limited to politics. Liberal and conservative sensibilities permeate all aspects of life, from science to art, from how children are raised to how an institution is run.Barish carefully notes that, while there are essential truths to both liberalism and conservatism, they can be expressed in moderate or extreme forms.He explains that extreme forms of conservatism, for example, are often authoritarian, intolerant, xenophobic and fundamentalist, or disguised justifications for protecting hierarchy and privilege.In contrast, he suggests extreme liberalism \"denies the legitimacy of current institutions and regards them as evil. The greater the felt illegitimacy of institutions, the greater the extremism. In its radical forms, liberalism believes that institutions are always wrong and aggrieved individuals are always right.\"Finding solutionsBarish identifies the emotions that sit below our political opinions - resentment, humiliation, pride and fear. Bridging Our Political Divide builds towards centering those emotions in our dialogue.Barish notes: \"One of the major themes of this book is that we are motivated in our political opinions first by feelings and secondarily by ideas or beliefs. Our political opinions begin with what feels right or wrong to us.\"According to the scholar, we can only begin to understand why we disagree - and how we can talk to one another more constructively - once we understand why our opponents feel the way they do. Although listening is difficult when strong feelings and opinions are involved, Barish shows us how dialogue is possible, even when we strongly disagree.\"We should express our \"opinions\" less often and, instead, express our \"concerns.\" We need to consider someone else's opinion with greater charity and regard our own with less certainty and more humility,\" he explains.\"We need to acknowledge the limits of our political attitudes and ideology and work toward greater pragmatism. We need to think less often of \"either/or\" and \"for/against,\" and more often of \"how\" and \"and/also.\"Bridging Our Political Divide is an essential contribution to a better national conversation. Barish offers a host of workable proposals, including building collaborative problem-solving discussions, identifying an opponent's most reasonable arguments, understanding the limits of one's own political philosophy and making small changes in response to another's concerns.Barish encourages readers, armed with his insights and potential solutions, to identify the ways that they can stretch across partisan divisions with a view toward building a better society for America's future generations.",

Here are the 2024 stakes for airlines, banks, EVs, health care and moreHugh Son, CNBCUpdated October 14, 2024 at 12:09 AMWith the U.S. election less than a month away, the country and its corporations are staring down two drastically different options.For airlines, banks, electric vehicle makers, health care companies, media firms, restaurants and tech giants, the outcome of the presidential contest could result in stark differences in the rules they'll face, the mergers they'll be allowed to pursue, and the taxes they'll pay.\nS&P 500 grinds higher to further record highs, finding little to fear in OctoberParents who do these 5 things raise kids who are more resilient than mostThis is the most overrated piece of job interview advice, tech exec saysDuring his last time in power, former President Donald Trump slashed the corporate tax rate, imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, and sought to cut regulation and red tape and discourage immigration, ideas he's expected to push again if he wins a second term.In contrast, Vice President Kamala Harris has endorsed hiking the tax rate on corporations to 28% from the 21% rate enacted under Trump, a move that would require congressional approval. Most business executives expect Harris to broadly continue President Joe Biden's policies, including his war on so-called junk fees across industries.Personnel is policy, as the saying goes, so the ramifications of the presidential race won't become clear until the winner begins appointments for as many as a dozen key bodies, including the Treasury, Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission, and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.CNBC examined the stakes of the 2024 presidential election for some of corporate America's biggest sectors. Here's what a Harris or Trump administration could mean for business:AirlinesThe result of the presidential election could affect everything from what airlines owe consumers for flight disruptions to how much it costs to build an aircraft in the United States.The Biden Department of Transportation, led by Secretary Pete Buttigieg, has taken a hard line on filling what it considers to be holes in air traveler protections. It has established or proposed new rules on issues including refunds for cancellations, family seating and service fee disclosures, a measure airlines have challenged in court.\"Who's in that DOT seat matters,\" said Jonathan Kletzel, who heads the travel, transportation and logistics practice at PwC.The current Democratic administration has also fought industry consolidation, winning two antitrust lawsuits that blocked a partnership between American Airlines and JetBlue Airways in the Northeast and JetBlue's now-scuttled plan to buy budget carrier Spirit Airlines.The previous Trump administration didn't pursue those types of consumer protections. Industry members say that under Trump, they would expect a more favorable environment for mergers, though four airlines already control more than three-quarters of the U.S. market.On the aerospace side, Boeing and the hundreds of suppliers that support it are seeking stability more than anything else.Trump has said on the campaign trail that he supports additional tariffs of 10% or 20% and higher duties on goods from China. That could drive up the cost of producing aircraft and other components for aerospace companies, just as a labor and skills shortage after the pandemic drives up expenses.Tariffs could also challenge the industry, if they spark retaliatory taxes or trade barriers to China and other countries, which are major buyers of aircraft from Boeing, a top U.S. exporter.-- Leslie JosephsBanksBig banks such as JPMorgan Chase faced an onslaught of new rules this year as Biden appointees pursued the most significant slate of regulations since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.Those efforts threaten tens of billions of dollars in industry revenue by slashing fees that banks impose on credit cards and overdrafts and radically revising the capital and risk framework they operate in. The fate of all of those measures is at risk if Trump is elected.Trump is expected to nominate appointees for key financial regulators, including the CFPB, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that could result in a weakening or killing off completely of the myriad rules in play.\"The Biden administration's regulatory agenda across sectors has been very ambitious, especially in finance, and large swaths of it stand to be rolled back by Trump appointees if he wins,\" said Tobin Marcus, head of U.S. policy at Wolfe Research.Bank CEOs and consultants say it would be a relief if aspects of the Biden era -- an aggressive CFPB, regulators who discouraged most mergers and elongated times for deal approvals -- were dialed back.\"It certainly helps if the president is Republican, and the odds tilt more favorably for the industry if it's a Republican sweep\" in Congress, said the CEO of a bank with nearly $100 billion in assets who declined to be identified speaking about regulators.Still, some observers point out that Trump 2.0 might not be as friendly to the industry as his first time in office.Trump's vice presidential pick, Sen. JD Vance, of Ohio, has often criticized Wall Street banks, and Trump last month began pushing an idea to cap credit card interest rates at 10%, a move that if enacted would have seismic implications for the industry.Bankers also say that Harris won't necessarily cater to traditional Democratic Party ideas that have made life tougher for banks. Unless Democrats seize both chambers of Congress as well as the presidency, it may be difficult to get agency heads approved if they're considered partisan picks, experts note.\"I would not write off the vice president as someone who's automatically going to go more progressive,\" said Lindsey Johnson, head of the Consumer Bankers Association, a trade group for big U.S. retail banks.-- Hugh SonEVsElectric vehicles have become a polarizing issue between Democrats and Republicans, especially in swing states such as Michigan that rely on the auto industry. There could be major changes in regulations and incentives for EVs if Trump regains power, a fact that's placed the industry in a temporary limbo.\"Depending on the election in the U.S., we may have mandates; we may not,\" Volkswagen Group of America CEO Pablo Di Si said Sept. 24 during an Automotive News conference. \"Am I going to make any decisions on future investments right now? Obviously not. We're waiting to see.\"Republicans, led by Trump, have largely condemned EVs, claiming they are being forced upon consumers and that they will ruin the U.S. automotive industry. Trump has vowed to roll back or eliminate many vehicle emissions standards under the Environmental Protection Agency and incentives to promote production and adoption of the vehicles.If elected, he's also expected to renew a battle with California and other states who set their own vehicle emissions standards.\"In a Republican win ... We see higher variance and more potential for change,\" UBS analyst Joseph Spak said in a Sept. 18 investor note.In contrast, Democrats, including Harris, have historically supported EVs and incentives such as those under the Biden administration's signature Inflation Reduction Act.Harris hasn't been as vocal a supporter of EVs lately amid slower-than-expected consumer adoption of the vehicles and consumer pushback. She has said she does not support an EV mandate such as the Zero-Emission Vehicles Act of 2019, which she cosponsored during her time as a senator, that would have required automakers to sell only electrified vehicles by 2040. Still, auto industry executives and officials expect a Harris presidency would be largely a continuation, though not a copy, of the past four years of Biden's EV policy.They expect some potential leniency on federal fuel economy regulations but minimal changes to the billions of dollars in incentives under the IRA.-- Mike WaylandHealth careBoth Harris and Trump have called for sweeping changes to the costly, complicated and entrenched U.S. health care system of doctors, insurers, drug manufacturers and middlemen, which costs the nation more than $4 trillion a year.Despite spending more on health care than any other wealthy country, the U.S. has the lowest life expectancy at birth, the highest rate of people with multiple chronic diseases and the highest maternal and infant death rates, according to the Commonwealth Fund, an independent research group.Meanwhile, roughly half of American adults say it is difficult to afford health care costs, which can drive some into debt or lead them to put off necessary care, according to a May poll conducted by health policy research organization KFF.Both Harris and Trump have taken aim at the pharmaceutical industry and proposed efforts to lower prescription drug prices in the U.S., which are nearly three times higher than those seen in other countries.But many of Trump's efforts to lower costs have been temporary or not immediately effective, health policy experts said. Meanwhile, Harris, if elected, can build on existing efforts of the Biden administration to deliver savings to more patients, they said.Harris specifically plans to expand certain provisions of the IRA, part of which aims to lower health care costs for seniors enrolled in Medicare. Harris cast the tie-breaking Senate vote to pass the law in 2022.Her campaign says she plans to extend two provisions to all Americans, not just seniors: a $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket drug spending and a $35 limit on monthly insulin costs.Harris also intends to accelerate and expand a provision allowing Medicare to directly negotiate drug prices with manufacturers for the first time. Drugmakers fiercely oppose those price talks, with some challenging the effort's constitutionality in court.Trump hasn't publicly indicated what he intends to do about IRA provisions.Some of Trump's prior efforts to lower drug prices \"didn't really come into fruition\" during his presidency, according to Dr. Mariana Socal, a professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.For example, he planned to use executive action to have Medicare pay no more than the lowest price that select other developed countries pay for drugs, a proposal that was blocked by court action and later rescinded.Trump also led multiple efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, including its expansion of Medicaid to low-income adults. In a campaign video in April, Trump said he was not running on terminating the ACA and would rather make it \"much, much better and far less money,\" though he has provided no specific plans.He reiterated his belief that the ACA was \"lousy health care\" during his Sept. 10 debate with Harris. But when asked he did not offer a replacement proposal, saying only that he has \"concepts of a plan.\"-- Annika Kim ConstantinoMediaTop of mind for media executives is mergers and the path, or lack thereof, to push them through.The media industry's state of turmoil -- shrinking audiences for traditional pay TV, the slowdown in advertising, and the rise of streaming and challenges in making it profitable -- means its companies are often mentioned in discussions of acquisitions and consolidation.While a merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media is set to move forward, with plans to close in the first half of 2025, many in media have said the Biden administration has broadly chilled deal-making.\"We just need an opportunity for deregulation, so companies can consolidate and do what we need to do even better,\" Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said in July at Allen & Co.'s annual Sun Valley conference.Media mogul John Malone recently told MoffettNathanson analysts that some deals are a nonstarter with this current Justice Department, including mergers between companies in the telecommunications and cable broadband space.Still, it's unclear how the regulatory environment could or would change depending on which party is in office. Disney was allowed to acquire Fox Corp.'s assets when Trump was in office, but his administration sued to block AT&T's merger with Time Warner. Meanwhile, under Biden's presidency, a federal judge blocked the sale of Simon & Schuster to Penguin Random House, but Amazon's acquisition of MGM was approved.\"My sense is, regardless of the election outcome, we are likely to remain in a similar tighter regulatory environment when looking at media industry dealmaking,\" said Marc DeBevoise, CEO and board director of Brightcove, a streaming technology company.When major media, and even tech, assets change hands, it could also mean increased scrutiny on those in control and whether it creates bias on the platforms.\"Overall, the government and FCC have always been most concerned with having a diversity of voices,\" said Jonathan Miller, chief executive of Integrated Media, which specializes in digital media investment.\"But then  happened, and it's clearly showing you can skew a platform to not just what the business needs, but to maybe your personal approach and whims,\" he said.Since Musk acquired the social media platform in 2022, changing its name to X, he has implemented sweeping changes including cutting staff and giving \"amnesty\" to previously suspended accounts, including Trump's, which had been suspended following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection. Musk has also faced widespread criticism from civil rights groups for the amplification of bigotry on the platform.Musk has publicly endorsed Trump, and was recently on the campaign trail with the former president. \"As you can see, I'm not just MAGA, I'm Dark MAGA,\" Musk said at a recent event. The billionaire has raised funds for Republican causes, and Trump has suggested Musk could eventually play a role in his administration if the Republican candidate were to be reelected.During his first term, Trump took a particularly hard stance against journalists, and pursued investigations into leaks from his administration to news organizations. Under Biden, the White House has been notably more amenable to journalists.Also top of mind for media executives -- and government officials -- is TikTok.Lawmakers have argued that TikTok's Chinese ownership could be a national security risk.Earlier this year, Biden signed legislation that gives Chinese parent ByteDance until January to find a new owner for the platform or face a U.S. ban. TikTok has said the bill, the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which passed with bipartisan support, violates the First Amendment. The platform has sued the government to stop a potential ban.While Trump was in office, he attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order, but the effort failed. However, he has more recently switched to supporting the platform, arguing that without it there's less competition against Meta's Facebook and other social media.-- Lillian Rizzo and Alex ShermanRestaurantsBoth Trump and Harris have endorsed plans to end taxes on restaurant workers' tips, although how they would do so is likely to differ.The food service and restaurant industry is the nation's second-largest private-sector employer, with 15.5 million jobs, according to the National Restaurant Association. Roughly 2.2 million of those employees are tipped servers and bartenders, who could end up with more money in their pockets if their tips are no longer taxed.Trump's campaign hasn't given much detail on how his administration would eliminate taxes on tips, but tax experts have warned that it could turn into a loophole for high earners. Claims from the Trump campaign that the Republican candidate is pro-labor have clashed with his record of appointing leaders to the National Labor Relations Board who have rolled back worker protections.Meanwhile, Harris has said she'd only exempt workers who make $75,000 or less from paying income tax on their tips, but the money would still be subject to taxes toward Social Security and Medicare, The Washington Post previously reported.\n\"In the short term, if  have to pay higher wages to their waiters, they're going to have to raise menu prices, which is going to lower demand,\" said Michael Lynn, a tipping expert and Cornell University professor.-- Amelia LucasTechWhichever candidate comes out ahead in November will have to grapple with the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence sector.Generative AI is the biggest story in tech since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022. It presents a conundrum for regulators, because it allows consumers to easily create text and images from simple queries, creating privacy and safety concerns.Harris has said she and Biden \"reject the false choice that suggests we can either protect the public or advance innovation.\" Last year, the White House issued an executive order that led to the formation of the Commerce Department's U.S. AI Safety Institute, which is evaluating AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic.Trump has committed to repealing the executive order.A second Trump administration might also attempt to challenge a Securities and Exchange Commission rule that requires companies to disclose cybersecurity incidents. The White House said in January that more transparency \"will incentivize corporate executives to invest in cybersecurity and cyber risk management.\"Trump's running mate, Vance, co-sponsored a bill designed to end the rule. Andrew Garbarino, the House Republican who introduced an identical bill, has said the SEC rule increases cybersecurity risk and overlaps with existing law on incident reporting.Also at stake in the election is the fate of dealmaking for tech investors and executives.With Lina Khan helming the FTC, the top tech companies have been largely thwarted from making big acquisitions, though the Justice Department and European regulators have also created hurdles.Tech transaction volume peaked at $1.5 trillion in 2021, then plummeted to $544 billion last year and $465 billion in 2024 as of September, according to Dealogic.Many in the tech industry are critical of Khan and want her to be replaced should Harris win in November. Meanwhile, Vance, who worked in venture capital before entering politics, said as recently as February -- before he was chosen as Trump's running mate -- that Khan was \"doing a pretty good job.\"Khan, whom Biden nominated in 2021, has challenged Amazon and Meta on antitrust grounds and has said the FTC will investigate AI investments at Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft.-- Jordan Novet",

    "content": "Former President Donald Trump revealed Sunday that his youngest son is helping him \"a little bit\" on his strategies in reaching out to Generation Z voters, a coveted voting bloc in the 2024 presidential election.Barron Trump, the youngest of Trump's five children and who started college earlier this year, has given his father some advice on who he should do podcast interviews with, including people the former president has \"never heard of.\" This year, Trump has done podcast interviews with people like social media influencer and WWE wrestling champion Logan Paul and Lex Friedman, likely in an attempt to reach out to voters between the ages of 18 and 29.\"A little bit, I mean, he tells me about all the hot guys, people I'd never heard of, 'Dad, that guy is hot,'\" Trump said in an interview on Fox News's Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo. \"You know, it's very cute, actually. A little bit. You know, Barron's a very good student, he's going to a very good school, always got good marks. He's also tall, very tall, he's a tall student.\"The former president also deemed Democratic lawmakers as \"the enemy from within\" the United States faces when asked about bureaucrats opposing him, contending these enemies are greater than the external threats the nation faces. He specifically called out Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and \"the danger he put our country in\" with his repeated claims the former president colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election.Featured Local SavingsWhen talking about the conflict between Israel and the Middle East, he warned that the U.S. cannot have \"another fool\" as its president for the next four years, calling President Joe Biden a \"fool\" for the U.S.'s withdrawal from Afghanistan.

    "title": "Six books to help understand the United States and its politics",
    "content": "Bloomsbury Press, University of California Press, WW Norton & Company\nFrom the pursuit of happiness to economics as the election approaches, here are some books that offer context, insight, and perspectives on the United States.As the 2024 US presidential election approaches, it appears that people disagree on many issues. To help you understand the differences of opinion, consider the following six books, which provide detailed analyzes of the issues and their context. The books cover everything from the Declaration of Independence and changes in conservative politics beginning in the Reagan era to the cultural foundations of the United States. Added to this are the opioid drug epidemic, triggered in 1996 by the marketing of the prescription painkiller Oxycontin, and the economy, amid concerns about the cost of living. Will the United States be able to achieve a sense of \"We the People\" despite disagreements? This is the question that will have to be answered between now and the elections on November 5.These Truths A History of the United States by Jill Lepore (2018)Harvard history professor and New Yorker contributor Jill Lepore takes the title of her comprehensive and gripping history of the United States from the Declaration of Independence: \"We hold it to be self-evident that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator. with certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Spanning the 16th century through 2018, the book is \"the story of a nation, multiracial at its founding, and of those who sought ways to realize 'these truths,'\" writes John S. Gardner in The Guardian . \"No country before or since has been so racked by conflict and wealth,\" writes Andrew Sullivan in the New York Times Book Review. \"No country has ever been defined as a land of strangers and travelers, where waves and waves of immigration constantly passed through society. No people were so passionate about both slavery and freedom.\" These truths are the perfect civics book for these times. It is not a story of \"relentless progress,\" notes the New York Times Best Books of 2018, \"but of conflict and contradiction, with crosscurrents of reason and faith, of black and white, of immigrants and natives, industry and agriculture which reverberate through a story. it's far from over.Reaganland: America's Rightward Shift 1976-1980 by Rick Perlstein (2020)The final of four volumes in Pearlstein's chronicle of the rise of conservatism in the United States is a colorful narrative history. Perlstein begins with the Gerald Ford/Jimmy Carter presidential campaign. Reagan, an unsuccessful primary candidate, refused to help Ford, setting the stage for his own successful campaign against Carter four years later. \"It's all there, the Equal Rights Amendment Bill, Brother Billy, the Panama Canal Treaty, California Proposition 13 cutting property taxes, supply-side economics, the ' killer rabbit', direct mail, the Ford Pinto, Ted Kennedy, Three Mile Island, the malaise and a hundred other incidents and stories that defined those tumultuous years,\" writes John S. Gardner in The Guardian. Reaganland \"is essentially a sociopolitical history, focusing on the movements and causes that have animated public debate so virulently and on the impacts of major social changes, such as women's rights, on American life.\" Follow it with Max Boot's new biography Reagan, which focuses on Reagan's ties to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.Democracy and Solidarity: On the Cultural Roots of the American Political Crisis by James Davison Hunter (2024)In Culture Wars (1991), Hunter coined the term that describes the divide between two opposing forces in the United States. \"Democracy in America is in crisis,\" he writes in Democracy and Solidarity, his new book. It examines American political culture over two and a half centuries and identifies the cultural roots of the crisis: the promise that all are created equal, as opposed to the practice of excluding large swaths of humanity. \"Hunter is the nation's leading cultural historian,\" writes David Brooks in the New York Times. \"It reminds us that the political life of a nation rests on cultural foundations. Each society has its own way of seeing the world, its own basic assumptions about what is right and wrong, its own vision of a better world which gives direction and purpose to national life. American culture, which often achieves solidarity through opposition to a common enemy or affirmation of common purpose, has \"collapsed to its deepest levels,\" Hunter writes.\nFreedom and Sexuality by David J Garrow (1998)In June 2022, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the United States Supreme Court overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision which granted women the constitutional right to abortion, based on the right to privacy implied in the 14th Amendment. The action sparked an avalanche of state bills aimed at banning abortion, as well as parallel protests and actions aimed at restoring eggs. In Garrow's landmark legal story, he begins with a 40-year fight to repeal Connecticut's law banning birth control. It thoroughly covers Roe v. Wade, its precursors and successors, including the 25 years of litigation after Roe. It is a \"monumental, sprawling, insightful, frustrating, thought-provoking and wide-ranging book that chronicles one of the most profound transformations in the lives of modern Americans,\" writes sociologist and legal scholar Kristin Luker in the New York Times. She notes that \"much of the struggle to define the limits of the sexual revolution took place in legislatures and in the courts.\" The case, Garrow concludes, represents one of the two most important stories in 20th century legal history (the other is Brown v. Board of Education). What happens next will likely be determined by the US presidential election.Dreamland by Sam Quinones (2015)Dreamland, winner of Quinones' National Book Critics Circle Award, pieces together the puzzle of \"the worst drug scourge to ever hit the country.\" \"Children from the most privileged group in the richest country in the history of the world were becoming addicted and dying in near epidemic numbers from substances intended to numb pain,\" he writes. Opiate overdose deaths increased from 10 per day in 1999 to one every 30 minutes in 2012. Quinones' column on 'painkillers, pill mills, Mexican traffickers, the calm surrounding the epidemic' , is told in dramatic and heartbreaking detail, connecting small towns. and suburbs across the United States with a small town in Mexico in \"catastrophic synergy.\" OxyContin came first, he writes, \"introduced by Purdue Pharma representatives over steak and dessert and in air-conditioned medical offices. A few years later, black tar heroin followed in tiny uninflated balloons held in the mouths of Xalisco sugar cane farm boys driving an old Nissan Sentra to dates in McDonald's parking lots.\" Quinones offer glimmers of hope, including the widespread availability of naloxone, the antidote for heroin overdoses (also now used against fentanyl, the synthetic opioid 50 times more potent than heroin). The ultimate antidote, he asserts, is community.Life After Capitalism by George Gilder (2023)Economist Gilder's 1981 book, Wealth and Poverty, defined supply-side economics and influenced Reagan administration policy. His new proposal offers a contrarian theory based on the concept that knowledge is the true wealth. \"When you insert your credit card into the gas pump, what you are really buying is the knowledge that makes the transaction possible,\" Gilder writes. The essence of life after capitalism, he asserts, is \"the enormous shift of power enabled by government control of money, from productive citizens, innovators and entrepreneurs to politicians, bankers and the bureaucrats.\" Gilder's system is based on information theory. \"Economics focuses on human desires and incentives; information theory focuses on human creativity.\" Its key principles: \"Wealth is knowledge, growth is learning, information is surprise, money is time. \" Gilder tends to side with the optimists, who believe that technology, entrepreneurship and innovation can drive economic progress. Economic concerns are at the heart of the upcoming election, with the majority of Americans (about 70 percent, according to Pew research) worried about the rising costs of food and housing.What Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes OnlineLOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 24, 2020, / Compare-autoinsurance.Org has launched a new blog post that presents the main benefits of comparing multiple car insurance quotes.

    "title": "Evangelicals Flock to Washington to Pray for America... and Trump",
    "content": "The final days of the 2024 presidential election have begun to take on a decidedly different and some might say alarming tone. To be sure, there is still plenty of talk about tax rates and foreign policy, but there is something else in the air and it was on full display in Washington, DC yesterday when tens of thousands of evangelical Christians gathered on the National Mall for a day of prayers and beseeching the Powers That Be to intervene and help to save America. And how might He do that?By not simply saving America, but by protecting Donald Trump from harm. The event was billed as \"A Million Women,\" but both genders were well represented. The tone quickly took a dark turn, however when the election was described as \"a last stand moment\" to save the nation from the forces of darkness. (NBC News)Tens of thousands of evangelical Christians gathered on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., on Saturday to pray for America's atonement and for Donald Trump's return to the White House.Organizers of the event, billed \"A Million Women,\" described the gathering -- and next month's presidential election -- as \"a last stand moment\" to save the nation from forces of darkness. For hours, the gathered masses sang worship songs, waved flags symbolizing their belief that America was founded as an explicitly Christian nation and prayed aloud for Jesus to intercede on behalf of Trump in November.\"If we don't stand now,\" said Grace Lin, who traveled from Los Angeles for the rally and came wearing a red \"Make America Great Again\" hat, \"then the enemy will take over our country. If that happens, that's the end.\"There seemed to be few mentions of policy differences between the candidates. Comparisons between the economy Under Trump and Biden/Harris were few and far between. Crime rates were only dealt with as an underlying symptom of a larger, looming threat. The Harris/Walz ticket is a harbinger of doom, while Donald Trump is the Chosen One who can carry the banner of goodness and light forward. In other words, only God can save America from a path leading toward darkness and Donald J. Trump is God's man on the battlefield who will lead that charge.",

    "title": "Will Harris' Campaign Strategy Lead Her To Electoral Success? - OpEd",
    "content": "Kamala Harris' campaign team is employing different strategies in the final weeks running up to the 2024 US presidential election. Two prominent tactics are distancing herself from President Joe Biden and borrowing themes from Donald Trump's campaign. This raises several questions. Why is Harris' campaign pursuing these strategies? Will they help her win the White House on Nov. 5?Many Democratic leaders believe that President Biden has hindered rather than helped the party's prospects in 2024. Among them is former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who reportedly pressured Biden to exit the race after his poor performance in a debate against Trump early in the summer. His economic record is not impressive and several wars have occurred during his presidency, such as the conflicts in Gaza, Lebanon and between Russia and Ukraine.Historically, friction often arises between the staff of a sitting president and their vice president when the latter runs for president. This occurred in 2000, when Vice President Al Gore distanced himself from President Bill Clinton, particularly after Clinton's involvement in several ethical scandals. In 2024, a similar dynamic is playing out. Harris recognizes that Biden's approval ratings are low, so she is seeking to differentiate herself from him, especially in style. She aims to restore confidence among Democrats who have lost faith in Biden. Her campaign portrays her as a change-maker, conveying that the old guard of the Democratic Party is fading and that she represents the new face of change.Additionally, political observers have noted that Harris is borrowing several themes from her opponent's campaign. For example, she has adopted Trump's idea of eliminating taxation on tips for restaurant workers. Republican strategist Frank Luntz commented: \"Harris is taking pages out of the Republican playbook ... There's an important use of language, especially her focus on small business issues and describing herself as a capitalist. If you listen to these general statements, she sounds like a moderate Republican. The challenge for the Trump campaign is to move away from character attacks and focus on specific issues and her claims.\"On national security, Trump criticizes Biden and Harris for emboldening America's adversaries, such as China, Russia and Iran. Harris has used a similar tactic by accusing Trump of being a weak leader that no foreign head of state respects. She said last month: \"It's well known that Donald Trump is weak and wrong on national security and foreign policy. He admires dictators and wants to be a dictator himself.\"However, these tactics are not necessarily winning over the American public. A political strategist noted that borrowing from an opponent's playbook and relying on personal attacks can be tiresome to voters, who are \"tired of the same old playbook, filled with lies, grievances and name-calling.\" A complete political separation between Harris and the Biden White House is impossible, as she still needs the Democratic base to win the election. For millions of voters, she represents the preservation of Biden's legacy. Moreover, Harris cannot fully agree with Trump on economic policies. For instance, while Trump intends to interfere in Federal Reserve policy, Harris firmly disagrees with this approach.Ultimately, the scope of issues in any presidential campaign should surpass policy differences between a sitting president and their vice president when the latter is running to succeed them. It is also unlikely that voters will see little distinction between two presidential candidates simply because one borrows some themes from the other.",

A little bit. You know, Barron's a very good student, he's going to a very good school, always got good marks. He's also tall, very tall, he's a tall student.\"The former president also deemed Democratic lawmakers as \"the enemy from within\" the United States faces when asked about bureaucrats opposing him, contending these enemies are greater than the external threats the nation faces. He specifically called out Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and \"the danger he put our country in\" with his repeated claims the former president colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election.When talking about the conflict between Israel and the Middle East, he warned that the U.S. cannot have \"another fool\" as its president for the next four years, calling President Joe Biden a \"fool\" for the U.S.'s withdrawal from Afghanistan. He then argued Biden is smarter than Vice President Kamala Harris and claimed that the U.S. would no longer exist under her leadership.\nWith less than a month left before the presidential election, Trump confirmed that he will appear on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, which he revealed during a conversation on Nelk Boys's Full Send Podcast. Rogan has not confirmed this. The podcast host said in 2022 that he would never have Trump on his show as he was \"not interested in helping him,\" though he changed his tune last year, saying that \"maybe\" the former president could appear.New polling data for the 2024 presidential election has Trump and Harris neck-and-neck at 48% against a margin of error of 3.1 points.

    "content": "Did Donald Trump come close to a third assassination attempt? At his recent rally in Southern California, the 78-year-old Republican candidate spoke to supporters with just weeks to go before the 2024 presidential election. As Trump races for another term in the White House against Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris, he has faced multiple shooting threats in different U.S. states. Learn more about what happened at Trump's Coachella rally.No shots were fired during Trump's Coachella-based rally on Saturday, October 12. However, a man named Vem Miller was arrested for bringing a loaded gun and a high-capacity magazine to the event, per ABC 7. The Las Vegas resident was booked at the John J. Benoit Detention Center in Indio, California, on suspicion of possession of a loaded firearm and possession of a high-capacity magazine, according to online records viewed by Hollywood Life. He was later released on $5,000 bail.During a subsequent press conference on Sunday, October 13, the Riverside County Sheriff's Office assured that Miller's intentions did not affect Trump nor any attendee at his rally.Miller is scheduled for a court date on January 2, 2025, at the Indio Larson Justice Center, per the Riverside County Sheriff's Office's online inmate records.There have been two assassination attempts on Trump. On September 15, Ryan Wesley South aimed a gun at Trump's West Palm Beach, Florida, golf course. After shots were fired, he fled the scene, but authorities promptly arrested him.Two months prior, Thomas Matthew Crooks shot multiple rounds in Trump's direction while he spoke at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13. One bullet grazed Trump's ear, and Secret Service rushed him off the stage and into a car. Crooks was shot by a Secret Service sniper. Two rally attendees were struck by gunshots, and one of them died.Trump has not publicly reacted to the recent threat he apparently faced at his Southern California rally. However, he has released statements regarding the two previous assassination attempts. In September, Trump assured the public that he was \"safe and well\" and that he would \"never surrender.\"Following the Pennsylvania shooting, Trump released a statement thanking Secret Service personnel \"for their rapid response on the shooting that just took place in Butler, Pennsylvania.\"\"Most importantly, I want to extend my condolences to the family of the person at the rally who was killed, and also to the family of another person that was badly injured,\" Trump added.",

Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) on Sunday joined CNN's \"State of the Union,\" where he and host Dana Bash spared over 2020 election claims.Bash asked Donalds if Congress should follow the Electoral Count Act, which had an update passed in 2022 that will apply to certification of the 2024 presidential election.\"Look, I think when you're talking about the election this November, the thing that people want is that local jurisdictions follow the law passed by the states,\" Donalds said. \"As long as everybody does that, there's not going to be any problem certifying this election this November.\"Donalds began talking about the country needing a president who is going to \"secure our border.\" Bash tried to interject and say her question was about whether he will follow the new law. Donalds partially deflected the question and reiterated his previous answer.\"I've been very clear, Dana, as long as states and jurisdictions follow election procedures in their states, there will be no problem for me or anybody on Capitol Hill,\" he said.Bash responded by saying Donalds was leaving a \"giant loophole,\" because there is evidence that the states did follow proper procedures in the 2020 election.\"That's not a loophole,\" Donalds replied. \"If you look at what happened in Pennsylvania, Arizona and other jurisdictions in 2020, they did not follow election procedures passed by the state legislature. That's an empirical fact.\"Bash again said there is \"no evidence of widespread fraud\" and pointed to the dozens of legal cases that proved her point.Donalds said the state Supreme Court in Pennsylvania counting ballots three days after the polls closed was a violation of a state law and represented \"one example\" to back up his point.\"Congressman, this has been litigated, and I'm assuming that a lot more will be litigated. Let's just hope that everybody watches the votes counted and takes a breath and lets them be counted, particularly in Pennsylvania, which doesn't start to count by law until Election Day,\" Bash said before shutting down the interview.For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.",

(WITN) - Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a speech at East Carolina University that aimed to motivate voters in a presidential race that has razor thin margins according to fresh polling.Harris opened up her speech thanking local, state, and federal responders to the damage from Tropical Storm Helene in Western North Carolina.The VP says that her campaign is focused on the future while former President Donald Trump's is on the past.Watch Harris' full speech here:\"Ours is a campaign focused on issues that matter, for example, to working families across America, like bringing down the cost of living, investing in small businesses and entrepreneurs,\" Harris said before asking how many small business owners were in the room.\"We are focused on protecting reproductive freedom. We are focused on keeping our nation secure. But none of that is what we hear from Donald Trump. Instead, from him we are hearing from that same old tired playbook. He has no plan for how he'd address the plans of the American people. He is only focused on himself,\" Harris said to applause.Harris then got into policy goals for her potential administration.\"I will give a middle class tax cut to 100 million Americans, including $6,000 during the first year of your child's life knowing that the vast majority of parents have a natural desire to parent their children well, but not always the resources to be able to do it. And so extending the child tax credit to $6,000 to give folks the ability to be able to buy that car seat or that crib in that most fundamental phase of their child's development,\" Harris said.The vice president focused the later part of her speech on former President Trump and the threat she says he poses to the country if elected back to the White House.\"And we can already see the harm he's up to as a candidate. Most recently, spreading disinformation in the wake of natural disasters. Blocking real solutions that would stop drug cartels from crossing the border when he tried to kill and did that border security deal. Because you see, Donald Trump cares more about scaring people, creating fear. Running on a problem instead of what real leaders do, which is to participate in fixing problems,\" Harris said.Harris' speech lasted around 23 minutes.Just a little after 11 a.m., Harris landed at the Pitt-Greenville Airport. Democratic Congressman Don Davis was seen at the airport to greet the presidential nominee before she got into a motorcade.Harris then went to Koinonia Christian Center where she addressed the congregation.This stop was ahead of what organizers say is a sold-out rally at ECU. The vice president was in Raleigh Saturday night where she stopped at Pit Stop Authentic Barbecue to help pack Helene relief supplies.Harris has made multiple stops in North Carolina including one in Charlotte earlier this month for a briefing on Western Carolina storm damage.North Carolina is considered a battleground state in the 2024 presidential election.",

    "content": "'Before you study the economics, study the economists!'Opposition forces are involved in an imperialist conspiracySome like their sutra in punchy praetorian Latin. The Washington-based IMF (Import Mafia Front) is making us an offer we apparently can't refuse. The US even ordered their Pacific Fleet commander Steve Koehler to go after Sri Lanka's new President this week. In 'Greek' fashion, they also 'gifted' us some mothballed antiquarian hardware to enable surveillance. But not too much, and not too farther afield.Slit loose skirt soon followed crisp starched uniform. After the US Navy Commander (steeled fist), USAID Chief (silk glove) Aunty Sam Power called on President AK Kumara virtually. US delegations seem to divide into these 2 sartorial subspecies: uniform & skirt. Though the corporate suits are never far behind...'Although IMF actions are said to be devoid of politics,they may also be linked to the country's strategic importance'- Nimal Sanderatne, Sunday Times (see ee Economists)Sanderatne, a weekly columnist in an oligarchic newspaper group (he's also a shareholder in, famed for its anglomania), seems to have suddenly awoken from the hopium of 'free trade' - a policy pushed after England gained a monopoly over modern machine industry and the seas!The New York-based Fitch Ratings Agency said this week they will only erase the stigma of Sri Lanka's 'Default Rating (DR)', after Sri Lanka has normalised the relationship with the international financial community\". Normalization? This means: 'The sovereign's completion of a commercial debt restructuring.''International financial community' is an even more inbred subset of that 'international community': a humorous euphemism for the IMF's master - the USA - and its armed poodles scampering along. The IMF is promising stability if we agree to their colonial number crunching which essentially casts us into forever debt-bondage to fund their forever wars.French news poodle AFP referring to Sri Lanka's President as 'Leftist leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake' and an 'avowed Marxist', insists the IMF's 'painful austerity measures for Sri Lanka were 'bearing fruit' and 'must be sustained'. All the thinktanks and import mafias feel they can tie any elected government in knots: 'Dissanayake has little room to reshape the terms of the IMF deal.' 'There are certain red lines that the IMF will not agree to negotiate,' declared India regional Borah merchant prince Murtaza Jafferjee, head of the US-funded thinktank Advocata.Perhaps it is this onslaught that has finally inspired the National Freedom Front's Weerawansa & Democratic Left Front's Vasudeva Nanayakkara to call for supporting the presently ruling NPP. They have not gone further and called for a 'national salvation' government. The nation however is being subject to another costly and bruising parliamentary election. Local elections will follow, aimed at dividing the country, if the NPP does not go along with NATO's prescriptions.What may we do? India's Foreign Minister S Jaishankar also dropped in on Sri Lanka this week to deliver their perfunctory amendments to any excessive enthusiasm. This week's ee Focus reproduces Kalinga Seneviratne's Sri Lanka: Home-grown 'Color Revolution' Needs Support Both from India & China. He believes it is time China & India form an alternative to the Paris Club dominated by the European & Japanese creditors to assist Sri Lanka's transformation. India, however, remains a colonial outpost: Jaishankar believes 'if India & China can cooperate, they can bail out more countries, not only Sri Lanka'. So then, what's the problem? There are those pesky colonial borderline hangovers in the Himachal, etc, Jaishankar reminds. Not to mention, Trincomalee....For all? This 'deal' allows the USA to launch bombardments of Iran. Supposedly, Diego Garcia is the only land base from which they can bomb Iran (5,000km away - without retaliation from Iran?). The USA can also bomb Sri Lanka (2,000km from Diego Garcia) and India. India too, however, has agreed to this 'deal' that permits the US to maintain for another 99 years at least, an illegal base in the Indian Ocean (which somehow permitted 'Sri Lanka Tamils' to land there and demand refugee status from England, providing for yet another media diversion from the colonial question!)ee reported in August, on the US & Australia practicing bombing exercises there. African analysts see this deal with Mauritius (a member of the African Union/AU & the Southern African Development Community/SADC) as further evidence of the US escalations of war on Asia & Africa (see ee Random Notes). This is also evident in Colorado State University Prof Peter Harris in The Conversation's puffery, stating England coulda simply played da tuff guy:'London could probably have defied international opinion if it had wanted to. Nobody would have forced England to halt its illegal occupation of the Chagos Archipelago. But such a course would have badly undermined England's global reputation and its ability to criticise others for breaches of international law':This agreement will give England exactly what it wanted: a continued presence on Diego Garcia that conforms with international law... The US is another clear winner from the deal. In fact, hardly anything will change for the USA. Washington will continue working closely with London, and not need to negotiate an agreement with Mauritius on its rights to the base or the status of forces. Indeed, Pentagon officials should be thrilled that their base on Diego Garcia has been put on firm legal footing. This is something that England alone was unable to offer. The bilateral agreement with Mauritius will ensure the security of the base for 99 years - no small feat' (ee Sovereignty, England claims deal with Mauritius and India to grab Diego Garcia to be 'a win for all')*'With the support of the non-aligned movement, Sri Lanka introduced a proposal to the United Nations General Assembly in October 1971, on making the Indian Ocean a Zone of Peace. Although no country openly opposed or voted against it - that would have signaled support for Cold War tensions & superpower rivalry - ...the major powers - France, England, the Soviet Union, and the USA - abstained. In 1972, Sirimavo made a highly publicized and successful state visit to China, where she met with Mao. She described the relationship between the 2 nations as a model of inter-state relations\". By the end of 1976, China had become one of Sri Lanka's leading trade partners.' - Rathindra Kuruwita, Which Candidate Is China Likely to Back in Sri Lanka's 2024 Presidential Election? (see ee Sovereignty)* Sri Lanka had already become China's largest trade partner outside the East European Economic Common Market, after entering into the 1952 Rubber-Rice Pact, which has remained Sri Lanka's most successful trade agreement. The Ceylon-China Rubber-Rice Pact was fully opposed by a US-dominated Central Bank. The name Bandaranaike, at least of the elders, still resounds in the most populous country in the world.Comparing present PM Harini Amarasuriya to former PM Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the world's first female head of government, would be unscientific, let alone unfair. It's still laughable to hear the tweets in oohs & aahs of the so-called 'international (read: paleface) community' about Sri Lanka's civil-ized gender choice, as if apes had finally learnt to use imported toilet paper. The more apt comparison is between Sirimavo and AKD!As for Sirimavo, let's see how they treated that first woman president! They had assassinated her husband after his government attempted to institutionalize investment (a development bank) for industry, and, worse, for establishing relations with the USSR & New China. They attempted to militarily coup her, after she nationalized petroleum distribution. After she kicked out the English military bases and the US Peace Corps, they bribed ministers to split her government to maintain the colonial media monopoly. They lubricated an 'insurgency' of more expeditious utopians to, again, split her government. They removed her civil rights, lubricated another internecine insurgency in the south to prevent her return. And it is unclear how they finally pushed her aside. Who is 'they', you may ask? Ask yourself...It is (or was) a litmus test to measure the political colors of Colombots by daring to utter the name Sirimavo - even the blackest face turns red, the whitest pales. New names have been added to the pandemonium & pantheon. Rajapakses, for instance. Will AKD minus his AK be next? His family is his cadre party. Does 1962 plus 1971 add up to 2024? Or 1965, that year Hollywood claims was dangerous for living?It is strange that Sirimavo (if readers will forgive the familiarity) appears to have left no diaries - diaries we are told is a quintessential feminine art - and there is little scholarship about her statecraft, unlike about her husband, or her leading nemesis, JR Jayawardena. Instead, we are treated to the diversionary diaries of some of Sirimavo's secretaries, some of whom offer other readings of her 'anti-imperialism' - undermined as usual by political, military and economic warfare, overt and sotto sotto.*So here we are, still in the midst of colonial warmongering and media fog. The whites keep blocking access to energy sources, and seek to maintain control over trade, hindering relations with the East. This ee Focus therefore reproduces Garvin Karunaratne's scan of the history of Sri Lanka's Divisional Development Councils Program (1970-77): 'The DDCP addressed rural unemployment by encouraging cooperatives for agricultural, industrial and infrastructural projects.' He believes, the DDCP is a blueprint that can be immediately implemented almost entirely with existing staff and can get into production mode within months. The DDCP was 'a socialist concept', engineered & promoted by 'the Marxist group of ministers in the Cabinet', until they were forced to leave the government in 1975.This 6-year-old ee blog is dedicated to SBD de Silva. De Silva was a secretary to the Minister of Industries during a part of the early 1970s. He believed the then-government underestimated the enormity of the effort involved in the setting up a modern industrial state, and the power of the import mafia. He concluded the country needs a coordinated political, economic and military program to overcome underdevelopment. Karunaratne himself notes that the DDCP had to weed out 'people who pretended to have industries in an attempt to secure allocations of foreign exchange, import and sell the goods in the market instead of engaging in production'. But it appears to have been even worse.SBD de Silva recalled how a rentier capitalist class arose during the 'exchange controls regime' from 1972-77. This stands as a warning to the present NPP. These rentiers solidified their economic rule by:'Evading exchange controls through bribery, deception, corruption & illegal smuggling in of foreign goods. Acute shortages of goods in the domestic market stemming from world oil price increase, world food shortage and dearth of domestic foreign reserves created stupendous margins for smugglers and traders of foreign goods whose rate of profit surpassed the industries operating within the legal framework and thereby increased their financial dominance over weakly constituted merchant-manufacturing interests' (see Dhanusha Pathirana & Chandana Aluthge's A History of Underdevelopment & Political Economy of Inflation in Sri Lanka).The weak exchange controls ended up reinforcing the dominance of rentier capitalist class that arose after 1977.** There seems to be an overproduction of economic commentators offering Sri Lanka advice on how to deal with its economic challenges. All talk about numbers alone. From Harvard to Oxford to Gothenburg, none dare even come close to talking about the need for industrialization, let alone the types of modern industrialization we need to unshackle ourselves.Sri Lanka needs to prioritize our own industrialization, notes Radhika Desai & the Nicholases, no other country can do that for us (see Random Notes). This requires an enormous amount of state intervention - large-scale planning is required to break from underdevelopment. 'It's not going to happen via the free market.' A new international division of labor based on export-oriented industrialization has been incubated at innumerable imperialist thinktanks. The IMF has also set a minefield for this government. A rather unique Central Bank Act now prohibits them from buying any government debt, inhibiting any type of activist intervention. They've tied the hands of this government - 'virtually all the foreign exchange that's going to be earned is going to be used to repay debt in the future and our debt burden is massive'.

    "title": "Trump or Harris? Here are the 2024 stakes for airlines, banks, EVs, health care and more",
    "content": "With the U.S. election less than a month away, the country and its corporations are staring down two drastically different options.For airlines, banks, electric vehicle makers, health care companies, media firms, restaurants and tech giants, the outcome of the presidential contest could result in stark differences in the rules they'll face, the mergers they'll be allowed to pursue, and the taxes they'll pay.During his last time in power, former President Donald Trump slashed the corporate tax rate, imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, and sought to cut regulation and red tape and discourage immigration, ideas he's expected to push again if he wins a second term.In contrast, Vice President Kamala Harris has endorsed hiking the tax rate on corporations to 28% from the 21% rate enacted under Trump, a move that would require congressional approval. Most business executives expect Harris to broadly continue President Joe Biden's policies, including his war on so-called junk fees across industries.Personnel is policy, as the saying goes, so the ramifications of the presidential race won't become clear until the winner begins appointments for as many as a dozen key bodies, including the Treasury, Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission, and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.CNBC examined the stakes of the 2024 presidential election for some of corporate America's biggest sectors. Here's what a Harris or Trump administration could mean for business:The result of the presidential election could affect everything from what airlines owe consumers for flight disruptions to how much it costs to build an aircraft in the United States.The Biden Department of Transportation, led by Secretary Pete Buttigieg, has taken a hard line on filling what it considers to be holes in air traveler protections. It has established or proposed new rules on issues including refunds for cancellations, family seating and service fee disclosures, a measure airlines have challenged in court.\"Who's in that DOT seat matters,\" said Jonathan Kletzel, who heads the travel, transportation and logistics practice at PwC.The current Democratic administration has also fought industry consolidation, winning two antitrust lawsuits that blocked a partnership between American Airlines and JetBlue Airways in the Northeast and JetBlue's now-scuttled plan to buy budget carrier Spirit Airlines.The previous Trump administration didn't pursue those types of consumer protections. Industry members say that under Trump, they would expect a more favorable environment for mergers, though four airlines already control more than three-quarters of the U.S. market.On the aerospace side, Boeing and the hundreds of suppliers that support it are seeking stability more than anything else.Trump has said on the campaign trail that he supports additional tariffs of 10% or 20% and higher duties on goods from China. That could drive up the cost of producing aircraft and other components for aerospace companies, just as a labor and skills shortage after the pandemic drives up expenses.Tariffs could also challenge the industry, if they spark retaliatory taxes or trade barriers to China and other countries, which are major buyers of aircraft from Boeing, a top U.S. exporter.-- Leslie JosephsBig banks such as JPMorgan Chase faced an onslaught of new rules this year as Biden appointees pursued the most significant slate of regulations since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.Those efforts threaten tens of billions of dollars in industry revenue by slashing fees that banks impose on credit cards and overdrafts and radically revising the capital and risk framework they operate in. The fate of all of those measures is at risk if Trump is elected.Trump is expected to nominate appointees for key financial regulators, including the CFPB, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that could result in a weakening or killing off completely of the myriad rules in play.\"The Biden administration's regulatory agenda across sectors has been very ambitious, especially in finance, and large swaths of it stand to be rolled back by Trump appointees if he wins,\" said Tobin Marcus, head of U.S. policy at Wolfe Research.Bank CEOs and consultants say it would be a relief if aspects of the Biden era -- an aggressive CFPB, regulators who discouraged most mergers and elongated times for deal approvals -- were dialed back.\"It certainly helps if the president is Republican, and the odds tilt more favorably for the industry if it's a Republican sweep\" in Congress, said the CEO of a bank with nearly $100 billion in assets who declined to be identified speaking about regulators.Still, some observers point out that Trump 2.0 might not be as friendly to the industry as his first time in office.Trump's vice presidential pick, Sen. JD Vance, of Ohio, has often criticized Wall Street banks, and Trump last month began pushing an idea to cap credit card interest rates at 10%, a move that if enacted would have seismic implications for the industry.Bankers also say that Harris won't necessarily cater to traditional Democratic Party ideas that have made life tougher for banks. Unless Democrats seize both chambers of Congress as well as the presidency, it may be difficult to get agency heads approved if they're considered partisan picks, experts note.\"I would not write off the vice president as someone who's automatically going to go more progressive,\" said Lindsey Johnson, head of the Consumer Bankers Association, a trade group for big U.S. retail banks.-- Hugh SonElectric vehicles have become a polarizing issue between Democrats and Republicans, especially in swing states such as Michigan that rely on the auto industry. There could be major changes in regulations and incentives for EVs if Trump regains power, a fact that's placed the industry in a temporary limbo.\"Depending on the election in the U.S., we may have mandates; we may not,\" Volkswagen Group of America CEO Pablo Di Si said Sept. 24 during an Automotive News conference. \"Am I going to make any decisions on future investments right now? Obviously not. We're waiting to see.\"Republicans, led by Trump, have largely condemned EVs, claiming they are being forced upon consumers and that they will ruin the U.S. automotive industry. Trump has vowed to roll back or eliminate many vehicle emissions standards under the Environmental Protection Agency and incentives to promote production and adoption of the vehicles.If elected, he's also expected to renew a battle with California and other states who set their own vehicle emissions standards.\"In a Republican win ... We see higher variance and more potential for change,\" UBS analyst Joseph Spak said in a Sept. 18 investor note.In contrast, Democrats, including Harris, have historically supported EVs and incentives such as those under the Biden administration's signature Inflation Reduction Act.Harris hasn't been as vocal a supporter of EVs lately amid slower-than-expected consumer adoption of the vehicles and consumer pushback. She has said she does not support an EV mandate such as the Zero-Emission Vehicles Act of 2019, which she cosponsored during her time as a senator, that would have required automakers to sell only electrified vehicles by 2040. Still, auto industry executives and officials expect a Harris presidency would be largely a continuation, though not a copy, of the past four years of Biden's EV policy.They expect some potential leniency on federal fuel economy regulations but minimal changes to the billions of dollars in incentives under the IRA.-- Mike WaylandBoth Harris and Trump have called for sweeping changes to the costly, complicated and entrenched U.S. health care system of doctors, insurers, drug manufacturers and middlemen, which costs the nation more than $4 trillion a year.Despite spending more on health care than any other wealthy country, the U.S. has the lowest life expectancy at birth, the highest rate of people with multiple chronic diseases and the highest maternal and infant death rates, according to the Commonwealth Fund, an independent research group.Meanwhile, roughly half of American adults say it is difficult to afford health care costs, which can drive some into debt or lead them to put off necessary care, according to a May poll conducted by health policy research organization KFF.Both Harris and Trump have taken aim at the pharmaceutical industry and proposed efforts to lower prescription drug prices in the U.S., which are nearly three times higher than those seen in other countries.But many of Trump's efforts to lower costs have been temporary or not immediately effective, health policy experts said. Meanwhile, Harris, if elected, can build on existing efforts of the Biden administration to deliver savings to more patients, they said.Harris specifically plans to expand certain provisions of the IRA, part of which aims to lower health care costs for seniors enrolled in Medicare. Harris cast the tie-breaking Senate vote to pass the law in 2022.Her campaign says she plans to extend two provisions to all Americans, not just seniors: a $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket drug spending and a $35 limit on monthly insulin costs.Harris also intends to accelerate and expand a provision allowing Medicare to directly negotiate drug prices with manufacturers for the first time. Drugmakers fiercely oppose those price talks, with some challenging the effort's constitutionality in court.Trump hasn't publicly indicated what he intends to do about IRA provisions.Some of Trump's prior efforts to lower drug prices \"didn't really come into fruition\" during his presidency, according to Dr. Mariana Socal, a professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.For example, he planned to use executive action to have Medicare pay no more than the lowest price that select other developed countries pay for drugs, a proposal that was blocked by court action and later rescinded.Trump also led multiple efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, including its expansion of Medicaid to low-income adults. In a campaign video in April, Trump said he was not running on terminating the ACA and would rather make it \"much, much better and far less money,\" though he has provided no specific plans.He reiterated his belief that the ACA was \"lousy health care\" during his Sept. 10 debate with Harris. But when asked he did not offer a replacement proposal, saying only that he has \"concepts of a plan.\"-- Annika Kim ConstantinoTop of mind for media executives is mergers and the path, or lack thereof, to push them through.The media industry's state of turmoil -- shrinking audiences for traditional pay TV, the slowdown in advertising, and the rise of streaming and challenges in making it profitable -- means its companies are often mentioned in discussions of acquisitions and consolidation.While a merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media is set to move forward, with plans to close in the first half of 2025, many in media have said the Biden administration has broadly chilled deal-making.\"We just need an opportunity for deregulation, so companies can consolidate and do what we need to do even better,\" Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said in July at Allen & Co.'s annual Sun Valley conference.Media mogul John Malone recently told MoffettNathanson analysts that some deals are a nonstarter with this current Justice Department, including mergers between companies in the telecommunications and cable broadband space.Still, it's unclear how the regulatory environment could or would change depending on which party is in office. Disney was allowed to acquire Fox Corp.'s assets when Trump was in office, but his administration sued to block AT&T's merger with Time Warner. Meanwhile, under Biden's presidency, a federal judge blocked the sale of Simon & Schuster to Penguin Random House, but Amazon's acquisition of MGM was approved.\"My sense is, regardless of the election outcome, we are likely to remain in a similar tighter regulatory environment when looking at media industry dealmaking,\" said Marc DeBevoise, CEO and board director of Brightcove, a streaming technology company.When major media, and even tech, assets change hands, it could also mean increased scrutiny on those in control and whether it creates bias on the platforms.\"Overall, the government and FCC have always been most concerned with having a diversity of voices,\" said Jonathan Miller, chief executive of Integrated Media, which specializes in digital media investment.\"But then  happened, and it's clearly showing you can skew a platform to not just what the business needs, but to maybe your personal approach and whims,\" he said.Since Musk acquired the social media platform in 2022, changing its name to X, he has implemented sweeping changes including cutting staff and giving \"amnesty\" to previously suspended accounts, including Trump's, which had been suspended following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection. Musk has also faced widespread criticism from civil rights groups for the amplification of bigotry on the platform.Musk has publicly endorsed Trump, and was recently on the campaign trail with the former president. \"As you can see, I'm not just MAGA, I'm Dark MAGA,\" Musk said at a recent event. The billionaire has raised funds for Republican causes, and Trump has suggested Musk could eventually play a role in his administration if the Republican candidate were to be reelected.During his first term, Trump took a particularly hard stance against journalists, and pursued investigations into leaks from his administration to news organizations. Under Biden, the White House has been notably more amenable to journalists.Also top of mind for media executives -- and government officials -- is TikTok.Lawmakers have argued that TikTok's Chinese ownership could be a national security risk.Earlier this year, Biden signed legislation that gives Chinese parent ByteDance until January to find a new owner for the platform or face a U.S. ban. TikTok has said the bill, the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which passed with bipartisan support, violates the First Amendment. The platform has sued the government to stop a potential ban.While Trump was in office, he attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order, but the effort failed. However, he has more recently switched to supporting the platform, arguing that without it there's less competition against Meta's Facebook and other social media.-- Lillian Rizzo and Alex ShermanBoth Trump and Harris have endorsed plans to end taxes on restaurant workers' tips, although how they would do so is likely to differ.The food service and restaurant industry is the nation's second-largest private-sector employer, with 15.5 million jobs, according to the National Restaurant Association. Roughly 2.2 million of those employees are tipped servers and bartenders, who could end up with more money in their pockets if their tips are no longer taxed.Trump's campaign hasn't given much detail on how his administration would eliminate taxes on tips, but tax experts have warned that it could turn into a loophole for high earners. Claims from the Trump campaign that the Republican candidate is pro-labor have clashed with his record of appointing leaders to the National Labor Relations Board who have rolled back worker protections.Meanwhile, Harris has said she'd only exempt workers who make $75,000 or less from paying income tax on their tips, but the money would still be subject to taxes toward Social Security and Medicare, the Washington Post previously reported.\n\"In the short term, if  have to pay higher wages to their waiters, they're going to have to raise menu prices, which is going to lower demand,\" said Michael Lynn, a tipping expert and Cornell University professor.-- Amelia LucasWhichever candidate comes out ahead in November will have to grapple with the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence sector.Generative AI is the biggest story in tech since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022. It presents a conundrum for regulators, because it allows consumers to easily create text and images from simple queries, creating privacy and safety concerns.Harris has said she and Biden \"reject the false choice that suggests we can either protect the public or advance innovation.\" Last year, the White House issued an executive order that led to the formation of the Commerce Department's U.S. AI Safety Institute, which is evaluating AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic.Trump has committed to repealing the executive order.A second Trump administration might also attempt to challenge a Securities and Exchange Commission rule that requires companies to disclose cybersecurity incidents. The White House said in January that more transparency \"will incentivize corporate executives to invest in cybersecurity and cyber risk management.\"Trump's running mate, Vance, co-sponsored a bill designed to end the rule. Andrew Garbarino, the House Republican who introduced an identical bill, has said the SEC rule increases cybersecurity risk and overlaps with existing law on incident reporting.Also at stake in the election is the fate of dealmaking for tech investors and executives.With Lina Khan helming the FTC, the top tech companies have been largely thwarted from making big acquisitions, though the Justice Department and European regulators have also created hurdles.Tech transaction volume peaked at $1.5 trillion in 2021, then plummeted to $544 billion last year and $465 billion in 2024 as of September, according to Dealogic.Many in the tech industry are critical of Khan and want her to be replaced should Harris win in November. Meanwhile, Vance, who worked in venture capital before entering politics, said as recently as February -- before he was chosen as Trump's running mate -- that Khan was \"doing a pretty good job.\"Khan, whom Biden nominated in 2021, has challenged Amazon and Meta on antitrust grounds and has said the FTC will investigate AI investments at Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft.",

That could drive up the cost of producing aircraft and other components for aerospace companies, just as a labor and skills shortage after the pandemic drives up expenses.Tariffs could also challenge the industry, if they spark retaliatory taxes or trade barriers to China and other countries, which are major buyers of aircraft from Boeing, a top U.S. exporter.-- Leslie JosephsBanksBig banks such as JPMorgan Chase faced an onslaught of new rules this year as Biden appointees pursued the most significant slate of regulations since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.Those efforts threaten tens of billions of dollars in industry revenue by slashing fees that banks impose on credit cards and overdrafts and radically revising the capital and risk framework they operate in. The fate of all of those measures is at risk if Trump is elected.Trump is expected to nominate appointees for key financial regulators, including the CFPB, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that could result in a weakening or killing off completely of the myriad rules in play.\"The Biden administration's regulatory agenda across sectors has been very ambitious, especially in finance, and large swaths of it stand to be rolled back by Trump appointees if he wins,\" said Tobin Marcus, head of U.S. policy at Wolfe Research.Bank CEOs and consultants say it would be a relief if aspects of the Biden era -- an aggressive CFPB, regulators who discouraged most mergers and elongated times for deal approvals -- were dialed back.\"It certainly helps if the president is Republican, and the odds tilt more favorably for the industry if it's a Republican sweep\" in Congress, said the CEO of a bank with nearly $100 billion in assets who declined to be identified speaking about regulators.Still, some observers point out that Trump 2.0 might not be as friendly to the industry as his first time in office.Trump's vice presidential pick, Sen. JD Vance, of Ohio, has often criticized Wall Street banks, and Trump last month began pushing an idea to cap credit card interest rates at 10%, a move that if enacted would have seismic implications for the industry.Bankers also say that Harris won't necessarily cater to traditional Democratic Party ideas that have made life tougher for banks. Unless Democrats seize both chambers of Congress as well as the presidency, it may be difficult to get agency heads approved if they're considered partisan picks, experts note.\"I would not write off the vice president as someone who's automatically going to go more progressive,\" said Lindsey Johnson, head of the Consumer Bankers Association, a trade group for big U.S. retail banks.-- Hugh SonEVsElectric vehicles have become a polarizing issue between Democrats and Republicans, especially in swing states such as Michigan that rely on the auto industry. There could be major changes in regulations and incentives for EVs if Trump regains power, a fact that's placed the industry in a temporary limbo.\"Depending on the election in the U.S., we may have mandates; we may not,\" Volkswagen Group of America CEO Pablo Di Si said Sept. 24 during an Automotive News conference. \"Am I going to make any decisions on future investments right now? Obviously not. We're waiting to see.\"Republicans, led by Trump, have largely condemned EVs, claiming they are being forced upon consumers and that they will ruin the U.S. automotive industry. Trump has vowed to roll back or eliminate many vehicle emissions standards under the Environmental Protection Agency and incentives to promote production and adoption of the vehicles.If elected, he's also expected to renew a battle with California and other states who set their own vehicle emissions standards.\"In a Republican win ... We see higher variance and more potential for change,\" UBS analyst Joseph Spak said in a Sept. 18 investor note.In contrast, Democrats, including Harris, have historically supported EVs and incentives such as those under the Biden administration's signature Inflation Reduction Act.Harris hasn't been as vocal a supporter of EVs lately amid slower-than-expected consumer adoption of the vehicles and consumer pushback. She has said she does not support an EV mandate such as the Zero-Emission Vehicles Act of 2019, which she cosponsored during her time as a senator, that would have required automakers to sell only electrified vehicles by 2040. Still, auto industry executives and officials expect a Harris presidency would be largely a continuation, though not a copy, of the past four years of Biden's EV policy.They expect some potential leniency on federal fuel economy regulations but minimal changes to the billions of dollars in incentives under the IRA.-- Mike WaylandHealth careBoth Harris and Trump have called for sweeping changes to the costly, complicated and entrenched U.S. health care system of doctors, insurers, drug manufacturers and middlemen, which costs the nation more than $4 trillion a year.Despite spending more on health care than any other wealthy country, the U.S. has the lowest life expectancy at birth, the highest rate of people with multiple chronic diseases and the highest maternal and infant death rates, according to the Commonwealth Fund, an independent research group.Meanwhile, roughly half of American adults say it is difficult to afford health care costs, which can drive some into debt or lead them to put off necessary care, according to a May poll conducted by health policy research organization KFF.Both Harris and Trump have taken aim at the pharmaceutical industry and proposed efforts to lower prescription drug prices in the U.S., which are nearly three times higher than those seen in other countries.But many of Trump's efforts to lower costs have been temporary or not immediately effective, health policy experts said. Meanwhile, Harris, if elected, can build on existing efforts of the Biden administration to deliver savings to more patients, they said.Harris specifically plans to expand certain provisions of the IRA, part of which aims to lower health care costs for seniors enrolled in Medicare. Harris cast the tie-breaking Senate vote to pass the law in 2022.Her campaign says she plans to extend two provisions to all Americans, not just seniors: a $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket drug spending and a $35 limit on monthly insulin costs.Harris also intends to accelerate and expand a provision allowing Medicare to directly negotiate drug prices with manufacturers for the first time. Drugmakers fiercely oppose those price talks, with some challenging the effort's constitutionality in court.Trump hasn't publicly indicated what he intends to do about IRA provisions.Some of Trump's prior efforts to lower drug prices \"didn't really come into fruition\" during his presidency, according to Dr. Mariana Socal, a professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.For example, he planned to use executive action to have Medicare pay no more than the lowest price that select other developed countries pay for drugs, a proposal that was blocked by court action and later rescinded.Trump also led multiple efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, including its expansion of Medicaid to low-income adults. In a campaign video in April, Trump said he was not running on terminating the ACA and would rather make it \"much, much better and far less money,\" though he has provided no specific plans.He reiterated his belief that the ACA was \"lousy health care\" during his Sept. 10 debate with Harris. But when asked he did not offer a replacement proposal, saying only that he has \"concepts of a plan.\"-- Annika Kim ConstantinoMediaTop of mind for media executives is mergers and the path, or lack thereof, to push them through.The media industry's state of turmoil -- shrinking audiences for traditional pay TV, the slowdown in advertising, and the rise of streaming and challenges in making it profitable -- means its companies are often mentioned in discussions of acquisitions and consolidation.While a merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media is set to move forward, with plans to close in the first half of 2025, many in media have said the Biden administration has broadly chilled deal-making.\"We just need an opportunity for deregulation, so companies can consolidate and do what we need to do even better,\" Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said in July at Allen & Co.'s annual Sun Valley conference.Media mogul John Malone recently told MoffettNathanson analysts that some deals are a nonstarter with this current Justice Department, including mergers between companies in the telecommunications and cable broadband space.Still, it's unclear how the regulatory environment could or would change depending on which party is in office. Disney was allowed to acquire Fox Corp.'s assets when Trump was in office, but his administration sued to block AT&T's merger with Time Warner. Meanwhile, under Biden's presidency, a federal judge blocked the sale of Simon & Schuster to Penguin Random House, but Amazon's acquisition of MGM was approved.\"My sense is, regardless of the election outcome, we are likely to remain in a similar tighter regulatory environment when looking at media industry dealmaking,\" said Marc DeBevoise, CEO and board director of Brightcove, a streaming technology company.When major media, and even tech, assets change hands, it could also mean increased scrutiny on those in control and whether it creates bias on the platforms.\"Overall, the government and FCC have always been most concerned with having a diversity of voices,\" said Jonathan Miller, chief executive of Integrated Media, which specializes in digital media investment.\"But then  happened, and it's clearly showing you can skew a platform to not just what the business needs, but to maybe your personal approach and whims,\" he said.Since Musk acquired the social media platform in 2022, changing its name to X, he has implemented sweeping changes including cutting staff and giving \"amnesty\" to previously suspended accounts, including Trump's, which had been suspended following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection. Musk has also faced widespread criticism from civil rights groups for the amplification of bigotry on the platform.Musk has publicly endorsed Trump, and was recently on the campaign trail with the former president. \"As you can see, I'm not just MAGA, I'm Dark MAGA,\" Musk said at a recent event. The billionaire has raised funds for Republican causes, and Trump has suggested Musk could eventually play a role in his administration if the Republican candidate were to be reelected.During his first term, Trump took a particularly hard stance against journalists, and pursued investigations into leaks from his administration to news organizations. Under Biden, the White House has been notably more amenable to journalists.Also top of mind for media executives -- and government officials -- is TikTok.Lawmakers have argued that TikTok's Chinese ownership could be a national security risk.Earlier this year, Biden signed legislation that gives Chinese parent ByteDance until January to find a new owner for the platform or face a U.S. ban. TikTok has said the bill, the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which passed with bipartisan support, violates the First Amendment. The platform has sued the government to stop a potential ban.While Trump was in office, he attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order, but the effort failed. However, he has more recently switched to supporting the platform, arguing that without it there's less competition against Meta's Facebook and other social media.-- Lillian Rizzo and Alex ShermanRestaurantsBoth Trump and Harris have endorsed plans to end taxes on restaurant workers' tips, although how they would do so is likely to differ.The food service and restaurant industry is the nation's second-largest private-sector employer, with 15.5 million jobs, according to the National Restaurant Association. Roughly 2.2 million of those employees are tipped servers and bartenders, who could end up with more money in their pockets if their tips are no longer taxed.Trump's campaign hasn't given much detail on how his administration would eliminate taxes on tips, but tax experts have warned that it could turn into a loophole for high earners. Claims from the Trump campaign that the Republican candidate is pro-labor have clashed with his record of appointing leaders to the National Labor Relations Board who have rolled back worker protections.Meanwhile, Harris has said she'd only exempt workers who make $75,000 or less from paying income tax on their tips, but the money would still be subject to taxes toward Social Security and Medicare, the Washington Post previously reported.\n\"In the short term, if  have to pay higher wages to their waiters, they're going to have to raise menu prices, which is going to lower demand,\" said Michael Lynn, a tipping expert and Cornell University professor.-- Amelia LucasTechWhichever candidate comes out ahead in November will have to grapple with the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence sector.Generative AI is the biggest story in tech since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022. It presents a conundrum for regulators, because it allows consumers to easily create text and images from simple queries, creating privacy and safety concerns.Harris has said she and Biden \"reject the false choice that suggests we can either protect the public or advance innovation.\" Last year, the White House issued an executive order that led to the formation of the Commerce Department's U.S. AI Safety Institute, which is evaluating AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic.Trump has committed to repealing the executive order.A second Trump administration might also attempt to challenge a Securities and Exchange Commission rule that requires companies to disclose cybersecurity incidents. The White House said in January that more transparency \"will incentivize corporate executives to invest in cybersecurity and cyber risk management.\"Trump's running mate, Vance, co-sponsored a bill designed to end the rule. Andrew Garbarino, the House Republican who introduced an identical bill, has said the SEC rule increases cybersecurity risk and overlaps with existing law on incident reporting.Also at stake in the election is the fate of dealmaking for tech investors and executives.With Lina Khan helming the FTC, the top tech companies have been largely thwarted from making big acquisitions, though the Justice Department and European regulators have also created hurdles.Tech transaction volume peaked at $1.5 trillion in 2021, then plummeted to $544 billion last year and $465 billion in 2024 as of September, according to Dealogic.Many in the tech industry are critical of Khan and want her to be replaced should Harris win in November. Meanwhile, Vance, who worked in venture capital before entering politics, said as recently as February -- before he was chosen as Trump's running mate -- that Khan was \"doing a pretty good job.\"Khan, whom Biden nominated in 2021, has challenged Amazon and Meta on antitrust grounds and has said the FTC will investigate AI investments at Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft.-- Jordan Novet",

    "title": "Crypto has a leadership problem: What can regulators do?",
    "content": "Crypto cons are frequent, and the sector's loudest and most well-known leaders have faced substantial legal trouble in recent years.You know the names:Crypto.news collected some commentary about whether the crypto industry has a serious leadership problem, or simply suffers from a few bad apples. At a glance, it does seem like fertile ground for shady goings-on.But then again, \"is it worse than anything else that's out there?\" asks Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital.\"You could say there are bad apples in other parts of finance,\" Scaramucci told us via Saxo. \"I would maintain it's not worse than anything else. I would say that we're in the process of cleaning this up.\"Scaramucci, whose hedge fund embraced Bitcoin (BTC) as an offering in 2020, has a prolific career in finance, having spent seven years at Goldman Sachs.He was also a former White House communications director for 11 days under ex-President Donald Trump.Scaramucci has since soured on Trump and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for the 2024 presidential election. He even revealed at the TOKEN2049 conference in Singapore that he and other cryptocurrency advocates are collaborating with the Harris campaign to shape more industry-friendly policies should she win on Election Day, Nov. 5.For crypto investors, it's exactly what they're looking for: an inside man who knows the industry and can carve inroads with Washington, D.C. Up until now, their big gripe is with the Biden administration and the current leadership within the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).In 2023, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, a Biden appointee, brought a total of 46 cryptocurrency-related enforcement actions. That's up 53% from 2022, according to Cornerstone Research.Lawmakers were perhaps \"embarrassed\" by FTX founder Bankman-Fried, Scaramucci adds. Bankman-Fried was convicted of embezzling an estimated $10 billion of his customer's deposits (Scaramucci's SkyBridge suffered a hit when FTX collapsed).The SEC's enforcement actions grew more strict. Since FTX, Gensler has taken action against major players such as Binance, Coinbase, Ripple, and Terraform Labs. This has sparked numerous legal battles, including ongoing high-profile cases against Ripple and other big-name firms in the industry.Most cryptocurrency tokens qualify as securities under U.S. law and, as a result, fall under SEC oversight.\"I thought that they  were overly aggressive in terms of their anti-crypto positioning,\" Scaramucci says. \"It was unnecessary to be that aggressive.\"Other crypto pros share a similar sentiment. Tim Kravchunovsky, founder and CEO of decentralized telecommunications company, Chirp, argues that those enforcement actions by the SEC felt more like attacks rather than constructive oversight.\"Crypto investors were met with confusion, inconsistent policies, and outright hostility at times,\" Kravchunovsky said of the past four years. \"Instead of fostering innovation or providing clarity, the  administration's actions raised anxiety, leaving investors guessing about the future of the space.\"Crypto's PR nightmare continued last week when U.S. prosecutors brought charges against 15 people across four companies: Gotbit, ZM Quant, CLS Global and MyTrade.The firms engaged in fraudulent practices designed to manipulate the market, according to the FBI.But scenarios like this \"don't represent all of crypto,\" Kravchunovsky insists.\"The industry doesn't have a leadership problem -- it has a trust problem,\" he says. \"Every time someone like Sam Bankman-Fried makes headlines for fraud, the media paints the entire industry with the same brush. But remember, in any sector where money flows, so do opportunists and criminals. It's not unique to crypto.\"Indeed, crime permeates all corners of finance. In 2023, more than three trillion dollars in illicit funds reportedly flowed through the global financial system. This trend is expected to continue, driven largely by the rise in digital technologies, which provide new avenues for criminals.\"It's unfortunate that there has been a growing list of arrests and charges amongst high-profile crypto leaders,\" David Morrison, Senior Market Analyst at Trade Nation, says. \"Some have clearly been bad actors who have bamboozled and defrauded their customers, broken regulations deliberately for their own gain, and so on. But this is not unusual where new technologies and money collide.\"It's a bad look, but one Morrison expects to improve \"should regulation continue to develop in ways helpful to the sector as a whole.\"\"That will require regulators and policymakers with a genuine interest and understanding of cryptos, valuing its importance while welcoming its potential,\" he said.It's no wonder the industry looks to Trump's possible re-election as a silver lining. The 78-year-old candidate saw an opportunity to court a passionate portion of the electorate that had grown frustrated with the Biden administration. Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss are two of his biggest donors.Once a crypto skeptic, the twice-impeached Trump is now amongst the industry's most ardent cheerleaders. He's even gearing up for the public sale of his own token under the banner of World Liberty Financial, a firm he launched with his three sons, starting Tuesday, Oct. 15.Polymarket, a platform that allows gamblers to bet on real-world events using crypto, has him currently leading Harris in a 2024 presidential prediction by more than eight percentage points.But in an industry marred by illegalities, is Trump -- the first former U.S. president to be convicted of felony crimes -- crypto's best bet? Even the Republican's most staunch supporters have a bad feeling about World Liberty Financial.\"Whether you like Trump or not, his World Liberty Financial venture shows he's not shying away from crypto,\" Kravchunovsky says. \"Say what you will about the hype, but at least he's not trying to kill the industry with endless regulations.\"Crypto is one area Harris has seemingly deviated from Biden. Last month, at an event in Manhattan, the Democratic nominee stated that she wants to embrace \"innovative technologies\" like digital assets while also protecting consumers and investors.Billionaires Mark Cuban and Ben Horowitz are both on board; so is Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, who made his first recorded cryptocurrency donation to her campaign.Should Harris win the election, Morrison offered some advice on behalf of his crypto peers: \"If Ms. Harris wins next month, then please don't relegate cryptocurrencies to the 'Can't be bothered' bucket.\"Crypto has the potential to help the unbanked and \"boost entrepreneurship in some of the poorest and most neglected places on our planet,\" he adds. \"Don't write it off just because Donald Trump talks about it so much.\"Kravchunovsky agrees.\"If Harris takes office, she needs to understand that crypto isn't just about speculation -- it's a transformative technology that could redefine industries,\" he said. \"But here's the thing: She's got to listen to people who actually understand blockchain, not just the hype artists or the bureaucrats who think in terms of control. This isn't about shutting it down, it's about creating a healthy environment for it to thrive responsibly. The U.S. can't afford to let fear or misinformation drive policy.\"As Scaramucci puts it: \"The best days for crypto are still ahead.\"",

    "title": "Trump or Harris? Here are the 2024 stakes for airlines, banks, EVs, healthcare and more",
    "content": "With the U.S. election less than a month away, the country and its corporations are staring down two drastically different options.For airlines, banks, electric vehicle makers, health-care companies, media firms, restaurants and tech giants, the outcome of the presidential contest could result in stark differences in the rules they'll face, the mergers they'll be allowed to pursue, and the taxes they'll pay.During his last time in power, former President Donald Trump slashed the corporate tax rate, imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, and sought to cut regulation and red tape and discourage immigration, ideas he's expected to push again if he wins a second term.In contrast, Vice President Kamala Harris has endorsed hiking the tax rate on corporations to 28% from the 21% rate enacted under Trump, a move that would require congressional approval. Most business executives expect Harris to broadly continue President Joe Biden's policies, including his war on so-called junk fees across industries.Personnel is policy, as the saying goes, so the ramifications of the presidential race won't become clear until the winner begins appointments for as many as a dozen key bodies, including the Treasury, Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission, and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.CNBC examined the stakes of the 2024 presidential election for some of corporate America's biggest sectors. Here's what a Harris or Trump administration could mean for business:The result of the presidential election could affect everything from what airlines owe consumers for flight disruptions to how much it costs to build an aircraft in the United States.The Biden Department of Transportation, led by Secretary Pete Buttigieg, has taken a hard line on filling what it considers to be holes in air traveler protections. It has established or proposed new rules on issues including refunds for cancellations, family seating and service fee disclosures, a measure airlines have challenged in court.\"Who's in that DOT seat matters,\" said Jonathan Kletzel, who heads the travel, transportation and logistics practice at PwC.The current Democratic administration has also fought industry consolidation, winning two antitrust lawsuits that blocked a partnership between American Airlines and JetBlue Airways in the Northeast and JetBlue's now-scuttled plan to buy budget carrier Spirit Airlines.The previous Trump administration didn't pursue those types of consumer protections. Industry members say that under Trump, they would expect a more favorable environment for mergers, though four airlines already control more than three-quarters of the U.S. market.On the aerospace side, Boeing and the hundreds of suppliers that support it are seeking stability more than anything else.Trump has said on the campaign trail that he supports additional tariffs of 10% or 20% and higher duties on goods from China. That could drive up the cost of producing aircraft and other components for aerospace companies, just as a labor and skills shortage after the pandemic drives up expenses.Tariffs could also challenge the industry, if they spark retaliatory taxes or trade barriers to China and other countries, which are major buyers of aircraft from Boeing, a top U.S. exporter.-- Leslie JosephsBig banks such as JPMorgan Chase faced an onslaught of new rules this year as Biden appointees pursued the most significant slate of regulations since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.Those efforts threaten tens of billions of dollars in industry revenue by slashing fees that banks impose on credit cards and overdrafts and radically revising the capital and risk framework they operate in. The fate of all of those measures is at risk if Trump is elected.Trump is expected to nominate appointees for key financial regulators, including the CFPB, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that could result in a weakening or killing off completely of the myriad rules in play.\"The Biden administration's regulatory agenda across sectors has been very ambitious, especially in finance, and large swaths of it stand to be rolled back by Trump appointees if he wins,\" said Tobin Marcus, head of U.S. policy at Wolfe Research.Bank CEOs and consultants say it would be a relief if aspects of the Biden era -- an aggressive CFPB, regulators who discouraged most mergers and elongated times for deal approvals -- were dialed back.\"It certainly helps if the president is Republican, and the odds tilt more favorably for the industry if it's a Republican sweep\" in Congress, said the CEO of a bank with nearly $100 billion in assets who declined to be identified speaking about regulators.Still, some observers point out that Trump 2.0 might not be as friendly to the industry as his first time in office.Trump's vice presidential pick, Sen. JD Vance, of Ohio, has often criticized Wall Street banks, and Trump last month began pushing an idea to cap credit card interest rates at 10%, a move that if enacted would have seismic implications for the industry.Bankers also say that Harris won't necessarily cater to traditional Democratic Party ideas that have made life tougher for banks. Unless Democrats seize both chambers of Congress as well as the presidency, it may be difficult to get agency heads approved if they're considered partisan picks, experts note.\"I would not write off the vice president as someone who's automatically going to go more progressive,\" said Lindsey Johnson, head of the Consumer Bankers Association, a trade group for big U.S. retail banks.-- Hugh SonElectric vehicles have become a polarizing issue between Democrats and Republicans, especially in swing states such as Michigan that rely on the auto industry. There could be major changes in regulations and incentives for EVs if Trump regains power, a fact that's placed the industry in a temporary limbo.\"Depending on the election in the U.S., we may have mandates; we may not,\" Volkswagen Group of America CEO Pablo Di Si said Sept. 24 during an Automotive News conference. \"Am I going to make any decisions on future investments right now? Obviously not. We're waiting to see.\"Republicans, led by Trump, have largely condemned EVs, claiming they are being forced upon consumers and that they will ruin the U.S. automotive industry. Trump has vowed to roll back or eliminate many vehicle emissions standards under the Environmental Protection Agency and incentives to promote production and adoption of the vehicles.If elected, he's also expected to renew a battle with California and other states who set their own vehicle emissions standards.\"In a Republican win ... We see higher variance and more potential for change,\" UBS analyst Joseph Spak said in a Sept. 18 investor note.In contrast, Democrats, including Harris, have historically supported EVs and incentives such as those under the Biden administration's signature Inflation Reduction Act.Harris hasn't been as vocal a supporter of EVs lately amid slower-than-expected consumer adoption of the vehicles and consumer pushback. She has said she does not support an EV mandate such as the Zero-Emission Vehicles Act of 2019, which she cosponsored during her time as a senator, that would have required automakers to sell only electrified vehicles by 2040. Still, auto industry executives and officials expect a Harris presidency would be largely a continuation, though not a copy, of the past four years of Biden's EV policy.They expect some potential leniency on federal fuel economy regulations but minimal changes to the billions of dollars in incentives under the IRA.-- Mike WaylandBoth Harris and Trump have called for sweeping changes to the costly, complicated and entrenched U.S. health-care system of doctors, insurers, drug manufacturers and middlemen, which costs the nation more than $4 trillion a year.Despite spending more on health care than any other wealthy country, the U.S. has the lowest life expectancy at birth, the highest rate of people with multiple chronic diseases and the highest maternal and infant death rates, according to the Commonwealth Fund, an independent research group.Meanwhile, roughly half of American adults say it is difficult to afford health-care costs, which can drive some into debt or lead them to put off necessary care, according to a May poll conducted by health policy research organization KFF.Both Harris and Trump have taken aim at the pharmaceutical industry and proposed efforts to lower prescription drug prices in the U.S., which are nearly three times higher than those seen in other countries.But many of Trump's efforts to lower costs have been temporary or not immediately effective, health policy experts said. Meanwhile, Harris, if elected, can build on existing efforts of the Biden administration to deliver savings to more patients, they said.Harris specifically plans to expand certain provisions of the IRA, part of which aims to lower health-care costs for seniors enrolled in Medicare. Harris cast the tie-breaking Senate vote to pass the law in 2022.Her campaign says she plans to extend two provisions to all Americans, not just seniors: a $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket drug spending and a $35 limit on monthly insulin costs.Harris also intends to accelerate and expand a provision allowing Medicare to directly negotiate drug prices with manufacturers for the first time. Drugmakers fiercely oppose those price talks, with some challenging the effort's constitutionality in court.Trump hasn't publicly indicated what he intends to do about IRA provisions.Some of Trump's prior efforts to lower drug prices \"didn't really come into fruition\" during his presidency, according to Dr. Mariana Socal, a professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.For example, he planned to use executive action to have Medicare pay no more than the lowest price that select other developed countries pay for drugs, a proposal that was blocked by court action and later rescinded.Trump also led multiple efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, including its expansion of Medicaid to low-income adults. In a campaign video in April, Trump said he was not running on terminating the ACA and would rather make it \"much, much better and far less money,\" though he has provided no specific plans.He reiterated his belief that the ACA was \"lousy health care\" during his Sept. 10 debate with Harris. But when asked he did not offer a replacement proposal, saying only that he has \"concepts of a plan.\"-- Annika Kim ConstantinoTop of mind for media executives is mergers and the path, or lack thereof, to push them through.The media industry's state of turmoil -- shrinking audiences for traditional pay TV, the slowdown in advertising, and the rise of streaming and challenges in making it profitable -- means its companies are often mentioned in discussions of acquisitions and consolidation.While a merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media is set to move forward, with plans to close in the first half of 2025, many in media have said the Biden administration has broadly chilled deal-making.\"We just need an opportunity for deregulation, so companies can consolidate and do what we need to do even better,\" Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said in July at Allen & Co.'s annual Sun Valley conference.Media mogul John Malone recently told MoffettNathanson analysts that some deals are a nonstarter with this current Justice Department, including mergers between companies in the telecommunications and cable broadband space.Still, it's unclear how the regulatory environment could or would change depending on which party is in office. Disney was allowed to acquire Fox Corp.'s assets when Trump was in office, but his administration sued to block AT&T's merger with Time Warner. Meanwhile, under Biden's presidency, a federal judge blocked the sale of Simon & Schuster to Penguin Random House, but Amazon's acquisition of MGM was approved.\"My sense is, regardless of the election outcome, we are likely to remain in a similar tighter regulatory environment when looking at media industry dealmaking,\" said Marc DeBevoise, CEO and board director of Brightcove, a streaming technology company.When major media, and even tech, assets change hands, it could also mean increased scrutiny on those in control and whether it creates bias on the platforms.\"Overall, the government and FCC have always been most concerned with having a diversity of voices,\" said Jonathan Miller, chief executive of Integrated Media, which specializes in digital media investment.\"But then  happened, and it's clearly showing you can skew a platform to not just what the business needs, but to maybe your personal approach and whims,\" he said.Since Musk acquired the social media platform in 2022, changing its name to X, he has implemented sweeping changes including cutting staff and giving \"amnesty\" to previously suspended accounts, including Trump's, which had been suspended following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection. Musk has also faced widespread criticism from civil rights groups for the amplification of bigotry on the platform.Musk has publicly endorsed Trump, and was recently on the campaign trail with the former president. \"As you can see, I'm not just MAGA, I'm Dark MAGA,\" Musk said at a recent event. The billionaire has raised funds for Republican causes, and Trump has suggested Musk could eventually play a role in his administration if the Republican candidate were to be reelected.During his first term, Trump took a particularly hard stance against journalists, and pursued investigations into leaks from his administration to news organizations. Under Biden, the White House has been notably more amenable to journalists.Also top of mind for media executives -- and government officials -- is TikTok.Lawmakers have argued that TikTok's Chinese ownership could be a national security risk.Earlier this year, Biden signed legislation that gives Chinese parent ByteDance until January to find a new owner for the platform or face a U.S. ban. TikTok has said the bill, the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which passed with bipartisan support, violates the First Amendment. The platform has sued the government to stop a potential ban.While Trump was in office, he attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order, but the effort failed. However, he has more recently switched to supporting the platform, arguing that without it there's less competition against Meta's Facebook and other social media.-- Lillian Rizzo and Alex ShermanBoth Trump and Harris have endorsed plans to end taxes on restaurant workers' tips, although how they would do so is likely to differ.The food service and restaurant industry is the nation's second-largest private-sector employer, with 15.5 million jobs, according to the National Restaurant Association. Roughly 2.2 million of those employees are tipped servers and bartenders, who could end up with more money in their pockets if their tips are no longer taxed.Trump's campaign hasn't given much detail on how his administration would eliminate taxes on tips, but tax experts have warned that it could turn into a loophole for high earners. Claims from the Trump campaign that the Republican candidate is pro-labor have clashed with his record of appointing leaders to the National Labor Relations Board who have rolled back worker protections.Meanwhile, Harris has said she'd only exempt workers who make $75,000 or less from paying income tax on their tips, but the money would still be subject to taxes toward Social Security and Medicare, the Washington Post previously reported.\n\"In the short term, if  have to pay higher wages to their waiters, they're going to have to raise menu prices, which is going to lower demand,\" said Michael Lynn, a tipping expert and Cornell University professor.-- Amelia LucasWhichever candidate comes out ahead in November will have to grapple with the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence sector.Generative AI is the biggest story in tech since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022. It presents a conundrum for regulators, because it allows consumers to easily create text and images from simple queries, creating privacy and safety concerns.Harris has said she and Biden \"reject the false choice that suggests we can either protect the public or advance innovation.\" Last year, the White House issued an executive order that led to the formation of the Commerce Department's U.S. AI Safety Institute, which is evaluating AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic.Trump has committed to repealing the executive order.A second Trump administration might also attempt to challenge a Securities and Exchange Commission rule that requires companies to disclose cybersecurity incidents. The White House said in January that more transparency \"will incentivize corporate executives to invest in cybersecurity and cyber risk management.\"Trump's running mate, Vance, co-sponsored a bill designed to end the rule. Andrew Garbarino, the House Republican who introduced an identical bill, has said the SEC rule increases cybersecurity risk and overlaps with existing law on incident reporting.Also at stake in the election is the fate of dealmaking for tech investors and executives.With Lina Khan helming the FTC, the top tech companies have been largely thwarted from making big acquisitions, though the Justice Department and European regulators have also created hurdles.Tech transaction volume peaked at $1.5 trillion in 2021, then plummeted to $544 billion last year and $465 billion in 2024 as of September, according to Dealogic.Many in the tech industry are critical of Khan and want her to be replaced should Harris win in November. Meanwhile, Vance, who worked in venture capital before entering politics, said as recently as February -- before he was chosen as Trump's running mate -- that Khan was \"doing a pretty good job.\"Khan, whom Biden nominated in 2021, has challenged Amazon and Meta on antitrust grounds and has said the FTC will investigate AI investments at Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft.",

I'm not sure if our President understands those rights. That every American has the right to speak out also to protest.

    "title": "'Kamala's Cooked, Mood Shifted' - Saturday Night Live Roasts Harris Again [WATCH]",
    "content": "Social media erupted after the latest Saturday Night Live (SNL) skits targeting Kamala Harris, with many viewers interpreting the mockery as a bad omen for the Democratic candidate.Played by Maya Rudolph, Harris' portrayal in the satirical show has been a frequent feature as the 2024 presidential election draws near.However, the recent skits have drawn heightened attention and sparked widespread commentary online.Patriotic beachwear for freedom lovers! Shop now and get 10% off with code RB10. Vet & LEO-founded.In Saturday night's episode, SNL took aim at Harris in a Family Feud-style skit.The portrayal highlighted some of Harris' well-known traits, including her use of what some have described as \"word salad\" rhetoric.The episode quickly drew responses from viewers on social media platforms, especially X (formerly known as Twitter), where many took the humor as a sign of Harris' faltering public image.Robby Starbuck, a well-known conservative commentator, posted, \"When SNL is doing skits like this, you know that they think Kamala's cooked. Mood shifted. I see zero on-the-ground excitement for her. The whole administration is a joke to normal people. A sick, sad, long joke that we're ready to be done with!\"Echoing similar sentiments, columnist Dustin Grage wrote, \"You know it's over when the Democrats have lost SNL. They just destroyed Kamala Harris.\"The Cold Open of Saturday's episode was set up as a Family Feud episode, where Vice President Harris faced off against Donald Trump, portrayed by James Austin Johnson. Kenan Thompson played Steve Harvey, the host of Family Feud, who asked both participants to name something kept in their car's glove compartment.Harris, depicted by Rudolph, responded with a long-winded answer beginning with, \"I was raised in a middle-class family,\" mimicking the vice president's usual speaking style.The audience burst into laughter before she ultimately landed on \"a Glock,\" referencing a 60 Minutes interview where Harris revealed that she owns a gun.The skit didn't spare other political figures either. Joe Biden, played by Dana Carvey, appeared in the same skit, portraying a confused and rambling Biden.At one point, Harris manipulated Trump's character with flattery, leading to Trump declaring, \"She's got my vote.\"The skit drew various reactions from viewers, many of whom interpreted the segment as a signal of a shift in SNL's political satire.One viewer commented, \"Even SNL couldn't resist taking a swing at Kamala Harris -- now you know things are bad!\"The show's portrayal of Harris also included a nod to her past public gaffes and mannerisms.In one scene, Harris, played by Rudolph, danced at a podium and introduced President Biden with a Jamaican accent -- something Harris has been criticized for in the past.The line \"If we win together, we could end the dramala and the tramala, and go relax in our pajamalas,\" further poked fun at her speech style.However, not all viewers saw the skit as a turning point. Some, particularly on the left, downplayed the moment, stating that SNL has long parodied Harris.One user wrote, \"Conservatives acting like SNL just started the Kamala 'but first, something about me' storyline is so funny to me bc they've been doing it since 2019.\"Yet, others saw it as more significant. \"Don't underestimate the cultural shift of SNL mocking Kamala. It's recognition she is toast & permission to walk away from her & her trainwreck of a campaign,\" one X user said.A sketch from a previous episode also resurfaced, fueling further conversation about Harris' image.The earlier skit portrayed Harris and her husband watching the vice-presidential debate, leading some viewers to speculate that SNL was referencing Harris' rumored drinking problem.The opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of LifeZette.

    "title": "Kamala Campaign Collapses, 'Lead Has All But Evaporated': NBC News [WATCH]",
    "content": "Recent polling data shows a dramatic shift in the presidential race between former President Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, with Trump gaining ground after weeks of trailing Harris.According to NBC News' latest survey, conducted between October 4 and 8, Trump and Harris are now tied at 48 percent each in a head-to-head matchup.Patriotic beachwear for freedom lovers! Shop now and get 10% off with code RB10. Vet & LEO-founded.When third-party candidates such as Cornel West and Dr. Jill Stein are included, Trump edges out Harris by one point, 47 percent to 46 percent.This represents a significant change from a September NBC poll, where Harris led Trump by five points, 49 percent to 44 percent.The October poll also shows that 4 percent of voters remain undecided or unwilling to choose between the two major-party candidates.The inclusion of third-party candidates has increased uncertainty in the race, as seven percent of respondents indicated support for other candidates or remained undecided.In addition to the tight race, the latest poll reflects shifts in the favorability ratings of both candidates.Trump's favorability has improved by three points since September, while Harris has seen her popularity decline from 48 percent to 43 percent.Trump's job performance, measured retroactively, stands at 48 percent, higher than it was during his presidency.The poll also revealed that 45 percent of respondents believe the Biden-Harris administration's policies are negatively impacting them, compared to just 25 percent who said they have benefited.Another poll released by the Wall Street Journal on Sunday further highlights the competitive nature of the race.The Journal found Trump leading Harris by a narrow margin, 46 percent to 45 percent, with swing states still too close to call.The NBC News poll aligns with the findings of other recent polls that have historically leaned toward Harris.In September, ABC News/Ipsos consistently showed Harris with a lead over Trump, but the latest numbers indicate that her advantage has dwindled to just two points.This four-point swing toward Trump has caused concern within the Harris campaign, especially with the election fast approaching.CNN's polling expert Harry Enten provided additional analysis, noting Trump's improving performance with key demographic groups. \"Donald Trump is going to put up the best performance with Black voters since Richard Nixon back in 1960 and among Hispanic voters, his performance for Republicans will be the best since 2004 under George W. Bush,\" Enten said.This surge in support from minority voters could be a critical factor in the final weeks of the race.The recent polling data underscores the volatile nature of the 2024 presidential election as both Trump and Harris continue to navigate an intensely competitive landscape.With only a few weeks remaining before Election Day, both campaigns will likely ramp up their efforts to win over undecided voters and secure their base of support.As the polling stands, the race remains too close to call, and the outcome could hinge on key swing states and the impact of third-party candidates.Both Trump and Harris face the challenge of maintaining their momentum in the final stretch of the campaign, with polling data showing a shifting tide in favor of the former president.The opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of LifeZette.

    "content": "For airlines, banks, electric vehicle makers, health-care companies, media firms, restaurants and tech giants, the outcome of the presidential contest could result in stark differences in the rules they'll face.With the U.S. election less than a month away, the country and its corporations are staring down two drastically different options.For airlines, banks, electric vehicle makers, health-care companies, media firms, restaurants and tech giants, the outcome of the presidential contest could result in stark differences in the rules they'll face, the mergers they'll be allowed to pursue, and the taxes they'll pay.During his last time in power, former President Donald Trump slashed the corporate tax rate, imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, and sought to cut regulation and red tape and discourage immigration, ideas he's expected to push again if he wins a second term.In contrast, Vice President Kamala Harris has endorsed hiking the tax rate on corporations to 28% from the 21% rate enacted under Trump, a move that would require congressional approval.

But when asked he did not offer a replacement proposal, saying only that he has \"concepts of a plan.\"-- Annika Kim ConstantinoTop of mind for media executives is mergers and the path, or lack thereof, to push them through.The media industry's state of turmoil -- shrinking audiences for traditional pay TV, the slowdown in advertising, and the rise of streaming and challenges in making it profitable -- means its companies are often mentioned in discussions of acquisitions and consolidation.While a merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media is set to move forward, with plans to close in the first half of 2025, many in media have said the Biden administration has broadly chilled deal-making.\"We just need an opportunity for deregulation, so companies can consolidate and do what we need to do even better,\" Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said in July at Allen & Co.'s annual Sun Valley conference.Media mogul John Malone recently told MoffettNathanson analysts that some deals are a nonstarter with this current Justice Department, including mergers between companies in the telecommunications and cable broadband space.Still, it's unclear how the regulatory environment could or would change depending on which party is in office. Disney was allowed to acquire Fox Corp.'s assets when Trump was in office, but his administration sued to block AT&T's merger with Time Warner. Meanwhile, under Biden's presidency, a federal judge blocked the sale of Simon & Schuster to Penguin Random House, but Amazon's acquisition of MGM was approved.\"My sense is, regardless of the election outcome, we are likely to remain in a similar tighter regulatory environment when looking at media industry dealmaking,\" said Marc DeBevoise, CEO and board director of Brightcove, a streaming technology company.When major media, and even tech, assets change hands, it could also mean increased scrutiny on those in control and whether it creates bias on the platforms.\"Overall, the government and FCC have always been most concerned with having a diversity of voices,\" said Jonathan Miller, chief executive of Integrated Media, which specializes in digital media investment.\"But then  happened, and it's clearly showing you can skew a platform to not just what the business needs, but to maybe your personal approach and whims,\" he said.Since Musk acquired the social media platform in 2022, changing its name to X, he has implemented sweeping changes including cutting staff and giving \"amnesty\" to previously suspended accounts, including Trump's, which had been suspended following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection. Musk has also faced widespread criticism from civil rights groups for the amplification of bigotry on the platform.Musk has publicly endorsed Trump, and was recently on the campaign trail with the former president. \"As you can see, I'm not just MAGA, I'm Dark MAGA,\" Musk said at a recent event. The billionaire has raised funds for Republican causes, and Trump has suggested Musk could eventually play a role in his administration if the Republican candidate were to be reelected.During his first term, Trump took a particularly hard stance against journalists, and pursued investigations into leaks from his administration to news organizations. Under Biden, the White House has been notably more amenable to journalists.Also top of mind for media executives -- and government officials -- is TikTok.Lawmakers have argued that TikTok's Chinese ownership could be a national security risk.Earlier this year, Biden signed legislation that gives Chinese parent ByteDance until January to find a new owner for the platform or face a U.S. ban. TikTok has said the bill, the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which passed with bipartisan support, violates the First Amendment. The platform has sued the government to stop a potential ban.While Trump was in office, he attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order, but the effort failed. However, he has more recently switched to supporting the platform, arguing that without it there's less competition against Meta's Facebook and other social media.-- Lillian Rizzo and Alex ShermanBoth Trump and Harris have endorsed plans to end taxes on restaurant workers' tips, although how they would do so is likely to differ.The food service and restaurant industry is the nation's second-largest private-sector employer, with 15.5 million jobs, according to the National Restaurant Association. Roughly 2.2 million of those employees are tipped servers and bartenders, who could end up with more money in their pockets if their tips are no longer taxed.Trump's campaign hasn't given much detail on how his administration would eliminate taxes on tips, but tax experts have warned that it could turn into a loophole for high earners. Claims from the Trump campaign that the Republican candidate is pro-labor have clashed with his record of appointing leaders to the National Labor Relations Board who have rolled back worker protections.Meanwhile, Harris has said she'd only exempt workers who make $75,000 or less from paying income tax on their tips, but the money would still be subject to taxes toward Social Security and Medicare, the Washington Post previously reported.\n\"In the short term, if  have to pay higher wages to their waiters, they're going to have to raise menu prices, which is going to lower demand,\" said Michael Lynn, a tipping expert and Cornell University professor.-- Amelia LucasWhichever candidate comes out ahead in November will have to grapple with the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence sector.Generative AI is the biggest story in tech since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022. It presents a conundrum for regulators, because it allows consumers to easily create text and images from simple queries, creating privacy and safety concerns.Harris has said she and Biden \"reject the false choice that suggests we can either protect the public or advance innovation.\" Last year, the White House issued an executive order that led to the formation of the Commerce Department's U.S. AI Safety Institute, which is evaluating AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic.Trump has committed to repealing the executive order.A second Trump administration might also attempt to challenge a Securities and Exchange Commission rule that requires companies to disclose cybersecurity incidents. The White House said in January that more transparency \"will incentivize corporate executives to invest in cybersecurity and cyber risk management.\"Trump's running mate, Vance, co-sponsored a bill designed to end the rule. Andrew Garbarino, the House Republican who introduced an identical bill, has said the SEC rule increases cybersecurity risk and overlaps with existing law on incident reporting.Also at stake in the election is the fate of dealmaking for tech investors and executives.With Lina Khan helming the FTC, the top tech companies have been largely thwarted from making big acquisitions, though the Justice Department and European regulators have also created hurdles.Tech transaction volume peaked at $1.5 trillion in 2021, then plummeted to $544 billion last year and $465 billion in 2024 as of September, according to Dealogic.Many in the tech industry are critical of Khan and want her to be replaced should Harris win in November. Meanwhile, Vance, who worked in venture capital before entering politics, said as recently as February -- before he was chosen as Trump's running mate -- that Khan was \"doing a pretty good job.\"Khan, whom Biden nominated in 2021, has challenged Amazon and Meta on antitrust grounds and has said the FTC will investigate AI investments at Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft.",

No, we don't have to pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Yes, we can demand that billionaires start paying their fair share of taxes.\"The Independent also highlighted the growing list of prominent Republicans now endorsing the Vice President's bid for the White House over Trump, signaling a need to preserve democracy and bipartisanship.Former Vice President Dick Cheney announced last month his plans to vote for Harris. Former Congresswoman Liz Cheney (R-WY), Cheney's daughter, who served as the third-ranking Republican in the House, campaigned with Harris in Ripon, Wisconsin last week. The city is recognized as the birthplace of the Republican Party.\"I disagreed with Dick Cheney on everything. I disagree with his daughter Liz Cheney on everything except the belief that we cannot elect somebody who is working overtime to undermine American democracy,\" Sanders said.Olivia Troye, the former homeland security adviser to Mike Pence and Former congressman Adam Kinzinger (R-IL), who voted with ten other House Republicans to impeach Trump following the Jan. 6 insurrection, was also among the list of Republicans to back Harris.More than 100 former national security and foreign policy officials who served in the Reagan, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush and Trump administrations also endorsed Harris in September, citing they \"firmly oppose the election of Donald Trump as president.\"Whether those endorsements will galvanize moderate or independent voters ahead of November is still to be determined.The Senator's visit comes one day after he joined United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain in Belvidere for a \"Keep the promise\" rally, intended to call on the automotive plant Stellantis to deliver on the agreement it made with the union last year to reopen its facility after claims that market conditions had delayed those plans.Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Harris will make their final pitches to voters over the next few weeks. Trump campaigned in California, a Democratic stronghold, at an event in Coachella.On Sunday, Vice President Harris will make a campaign stop in North Carolina, another key swing state.",

It's 2024, and we haven't found solutions for this,\" Young explains. \"It's a way to reclaim our power and rebuild our power.\"Ruffalo is not Native American but has gotten involved with various tribes through his years of environmental activism, explaining that \"we were all sort of fighting for the same thing, which was Mother Earth.\"He tells PEOPLE that change happens when people exercise their voices, citing how the U.S. government has made some progress with Indigenous representation since the last election.\"We're hopefully about to have our first Native female governor. We have Deb Haaland in the Department of the Interior, actually having a Native American speak for their own people in a cabinet of the presidency,\" he says. \"That comes from voting.\"With Walk to the Polls -- part of the larger civic engagement campaign Ride to the Polls -- Ruffalo says, \"The message  has been, 'Hey, this system has really treated you badly and it's completely understandable, your distrust for it, but the fact of the matter is the bad guys want you to not vote. This system hasn't been fair to you, but it's also the promise of America and using our vote is how we actually capture power and how we get a seat at the table.' \"Related: Mark Ruffalo and Rev. Jesse Jackson Throw Their Support Behind Dakota Access Pipeline ProtestorsDuring the 2020 presidential election season, the Diné were grappling with the severe impact of COVID-19, which led Ruffalo to partner with Young on spreading accurate information about the virus's danger. \"They were suffering much more than anyone else in the country with the most deaths and they had the least effective and well-funded healthcare system,\" Ruffalo explains.Four years later, just two days before Indigenous Peoples Day, Young and Ruffalo joined forces again for Walk to the Polls to shed light on election challenges and put an empowering spin on how Native American youth can fight back.\"I think it's a story about the wrong, disenfranchised, really invisible community that is making a statement that we're still here,\" Young tells PEOPLE.She adds, \"We are asking the world and specifically this country to acknowledge our existence and our contributions to this country and to American democracy. There are over 570-plus recognized tribes in the country, and a lot of people don't know that. So do your research.

    "title": "Fred McKinney (opinion): Which party has a better record on unemployment?",
    "content": "We could spend an eternity refuting the claims of former President Donald Trump on the performance of the U.S. economy during his term in office. Yes, we had the once-in-a-century disaster of a world-wide pandemic that brought the economy to a halt, but he likes to state without reference to any data points, that the U.S. economy during his term was the best in memory, if not history. These grandiose claims demand the light of data.According to leading political pollsters, the economy is the No. 1 issue Americans are concerned about in the 2024 presidential election. A recent Pew Research report states that concern about the economy (81%) rank higher than health care (65%), and Supreme Court nominations (63%), the next two most important issues. Interestingly and not surprisingly, there are differences in the views of what are the most important issues dependent on whether you are a Trump supporter or a Harris supporter. Trump supporters rank the economy (93%), immigration (82%) and violent crime (76%) as the top three issues. Harris supporters rank health care (76%), Supreme Court nominations (73%), and the economy (68%) as the top three issues. The economy is clearly on the minds of American voters this fall.Economists measure hundreds of economic phenomena, including inflation, GDP growth, personal income growth, international trade, government debts and deficits, labor force participation, productivity, stock prices, interest rates, and income and wealth inequality just to name a few. The unemployment rate is perhaps the number that attracts the most attention by economists, journalists, workers, and government officials.It is important as we get close to Election Day that Americans know what the unemployment rate is and what it is not. It is also important to remind Americans of recent history on the unemployment rate over recent presidential administrations.The unemployment rate is calculated based on a survey of about 60,000 American households. There are more than 131 million American households. The sample size represents about five households out of every 10,000 households. While that seems like a small sample, the sample is considered an accurate reflection for the total U.S. labor market.A person is unemployed only if they are not working any hours at the time of the survey, and they are actively seeking employment. Actively seeking employment is determined by a series of questions that identify specific activities by the sampled person showing that they are not just sitting on their couch. The survey is conducted and reported monthly. The September 2024 unemployment rate was 4.1%.The unemployment rate is calculated by dividing the number of unemployed persons by the number of people in the labor force. The labor force equals the total number of employed workers and unemployed workers.Curiosity drove me to look at how previous presidential administrations performed on this important metric. Every president inherits an economy from their predecessor. It is also true that presidents get too much credit for unemployment rate successes and too much blame for unemployment rate problems. Despite this lack of a direct relationship between presidential policy and unemployment rates, presidents are lauded for their unemployment success and excoriated for their failures, often in the form of being voted out of office. The buck does stop at the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, but American voters determine who is sitting at that desk.Since the Carter Administration in 1977, there have been eight presidents, from President Jimmy Carter and ending in President Joe Biden. One measure of their performance on unemployment rates is to look at the rate at the time their administration started and what that number was at the end of their administration. The accompanying chart shows the unemployment rate when the administration started, ended, and the highest unemployment rate during their term.Presidents are stewards of the national assets. Presidents Ronald Reagan, Clinton, Barack Obama and Biden all ended their terms with unemployment rates lower than the rate they inherited. President Carter ended his term with the same unemployment rate that he inherited. Presidents George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Trump all ended their terms with unemployment rates higher than the rate they inherited. While the sample is limited, all Democratic presidents had positive economic terms and all but one Republican president had negative experiences. The facts conflict with the conventional wisdom that Republican presidents are better for the economy than Democrats.Unfortunately for Democrats, Americans have short and distorted memories. The narrative that Trump presided over the \"best\" economy in American history does not conform to the facts. Do American voters who were adults during these earlier presidencies remember their experiences during these times? It seems we do not. Hopefully, this reminder will help American voters make decisions on which party or candidate is best for the economy based on the facts, and not what politicians falsely claim to be true.",

    "title": "Kamala Campaign Collapses, 'Lead Has All But Evaporated': NBC News [WATCH]",
    "content": "Recent polling data shows a dramatic shift in the presidential race between former President Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, with Trump gaining ground after weeks of trailing Harris.According to NBC News' latest survey, conducted between October 4 and 8, Trump and Harris are now tied at 48 percent each in a head-to-head matchup.Patriotic beachwear for freedom lovers! Shop now and get 10% off with code RB10. Vet & LEO-founded.When third-party candidates such as Cornel West and Dr. Jill Stein are included, Trump edges out Harris by one point, 47 percent to 46 percent.This represents a significant change from a September NBC poll, where Harris led Trump by five points, 49 percent to 44 percent.The October poll also shows that 4 percent of voters remain undecided or unwilling to choose between the two major-party candidates.The inclusion of third-party candidates has increased uncertainty in the race, as seven percent of respondents indicated support for other candidates or remained undecided.In addition to the tight race, the latest poll reflects shifts in the favorability ratings of both candidates.Trump's favorability has improved by three points since September, while Harris has seen her popularity decline from 48 percent to 43 percent.Trump's job performance, measured retroactively, stands at 48 percent, higher than it was during his presidency.The poll also revealed that 45 percent of respondents believe the Biden-Harris administration's policies are negatively impacting them, compared to just 25 percent who said they have benefited.Another poll released by the Wall Street Journal on Sunday further highlights the competitive nature of the race.The Journal found Trump leading Harris by a narrow margin, 46 percent to 45 percent, with swing states still too close to call.The NBC News poll aligns with the findings of other recent polls that have historically leaned toward Harris.In September, ABC News/Ipsos consistently showed Harris with a lead over Trump, but the latest numbers indicate that her advantage has dwindled to just two points.This four-point swing toward Trump has caused concern within the Harris campaign, especially with the election fast approaching.CNN's polling expert Harry Enten provided additional analysis, noting Trump's improving performance with key demographic groups. \"Donald Trump is going to put up the best performance with Black voters since Richard Nixon back in 1960 and among Hispanic voters, his performance for Republicans will be the best since 2004 under George W. Bush,\" Enten said.This surge in support from minority voters could be a critical factor in the final weeks of the race.The recent polling data underscores the volatile nature of the 2024 presidential election as both Trump and Harris continue to navigate an intensely competitive landscape.With only a few weeks remaining before Election Day, both campaigns will likely ramp up their efforts to win over undecided voters and secure their base of support.As the polling stands, the race remains too close to call, and the outcome could hinge on key swing states and the impact of third-party candidates.Both Trump and Harris face the challenge of maintaining their momentum in the final stretch of the campaign, with polling data showing a shifting tide in favor of the former president.The opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of Objectivist.

Shop now and get 10% off with code RB10. Vet & LEO-founded.In Saturday night's episode, SNL took aim at Harris in a Family Feud-style skit.The portrayal highlighted some of Harris' well-known traits, including her use of what some have described as \"word salad\" rhetoric.The episode quickly drew responses from viewers on social media platforms, especially X (formerly known as Twitter), where many took the humor as a sign of Harris' faltering public image.Robby Starbuck, a well-known conservative commentator, posted, \"When SNL is doing skits like this, you know that they think Kamala's cooked. Mood shifted. I see zero on-the-ground excitement for her. The whole administration is a joke to normal people. A sick, sad, long joke that we're ready to be done with!\"Echoing similar sentiments, columnist Dustin Grage wrote, \"You know it's over when the Democrats have lost SNL. They just destroyed Kamala Harris.\"The Cold Open of Saturday's episode was set up as a Family Feud episode, where Vice President Harris faced off against Donald Trump, portrayed by James Austin Johnson. Kenan Thompson played Steve Harvey, the host of Family Feud, who asked both participants to name something kept in their car's glove compartment.Harris, depicted by Rudolph, responded with a long-winded answer beginning with, \"I was raised in a middle-class family,\" mimicking the vice president's usual speaking style.The audience burst into laughter before she ultimately landed on \"a Glock,\" referencing a 60 Minutes interview where Harris revealed that she owns a gun.The skit didn't spare other political figures either. Joe Biden, played by Dana Carvey, appeared in the same skit, portraying a confused and rambling Biden.At one point, Harris manipulated Trump's character with flattery, leading to Trump declaring, \"She's got my vote.\"The skit drew various reactions from viewers, many of whom interpreted the segment as a signal of a shift in SNL's political satire.One viewer commented, \"Even SNL couldn't resist taking a swing at Kamala Harris -- now you know things are bad!\"The show's portrayal of Harris also included a nod to her past public gaffes and mannerisms.In one scene, Harris, played by Rudolph, danced at a podium and introduced President Biden with a Jamaican accent -- something Harris has been criticized for in the past.The line \"If we win together, we could end the dramala and the tramala, and go relax in our pajamalas,\" further poked fun at her speech style.However, not all viewers saw the skit as a turning point. Some, particularly on the left, downplayed the moment, stating that SNL has long parodied Harris.One user wrote, \"Conservatives acting like SNL just started the Kamala 'but first, something about me' storyline is so funny to me bc they've been doing it since 2019.\"Yet, others saw it as more significant. \"Don't underestimate the cultural shift of SNL mocking Kamala. It's recognition she is toast & permission to walk away from her & her trainwreck of a campaign,\" one X user said.A sketch from a previous episode also resurfaced, fueling further conversation about Harris' image.The earlier skit portrayed Harris and her husband watching the vice-presidential debate, leading some viewers to speculate that SNL was referencing Harris' rumored drinking problem.The opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of Objectivist.

    "content": "Rock and Roll icon Joan Jett & The Blackhearts released a new short music video for their song \"If You're Blue\" that demonstrates the band's endorsement for Kamala Harris and Tim Waltz for the 2024 presidential election. The video was directed by Kevin Kerslake, who has worked with other major artists such as Nirvana and Green Day, and sampled one minute of the \"If You're Blue\" Joan Jett & The Blackhearts song alongside powerful words such as \"We are the heirs to the greatest democracy in the world. It is now our turn to do what generations before us have done. We must be worthy of this moment.\"- a quote by Kamala Harris that was released in a video of her in the community on her Instagram page.Joan Jett herself makes her stance very clear after stating to the press that \"Every presidential election season, I've urged people to register and vote. Since 2000, I've felt the issues we face become increasingly consequential to our very core as Americans, and with each election, it is more urgent that we adopt policies that will keep America strong.\" She furthers this urgency and endorsement with a conclusion to the new \"If You're Blue\" music video sprawling the words \"Vote Blue\" big and bold across the screen as the song plays in the background.Following Joan Jett and The Blackhearts suit, Jon Bon Jovi released his own endorsement post October 11 on social media detailing his new song \"The People's House\" featuring Michigan gospel and country duo War and Treaty and how it \"celebrates the this beautiful place that we call home, from sea to shining sea.\" Bon Jovi went on to say, \"The truth matters.

I've written a song reminding us that out of many, we are still one.\" Legendary rockstar Neil Young also went on to endorse Kamala Harris and Tim Waltz in a new blog post on the Neil Young Archives claiming that Harris is \"...an honest, forthright truth teller who is experienced in the White House, free from ambiguity or evasiveness, who goes straight to the point.\" Young's strong dislike of Republican candidate Donald Trump is well known after suing Trump for unlicensed use of his music at Trump rallies therefore Young's strong endorsement of Harris comes at no surprise.",

    "title": "Donald Trump Hints at a Cost-Cutting Role for Elon Musk in Future White House Plans - NewsX World",
    "content": "Former U.S. President Donald Trump teased the possibility of involving billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk in a unique role within his administrationIn a recent interview with Fox News, former U.S. President Donald Trump teased the possibility of involving billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk in a unique role within his administration, should he win the 2024 presidential election. Trump, who has praised Musk's business acumen in the past, hinted at a new position that would focus on cost-cutting, a skill Musk has been known for in his ventures.During the interview on Sunday Morning Futures, hosted by Maria Bartiromo, Trump referred to Musk as a \"great business guy\" and \"great cost-cutter.\" Musk, who has led major companies like Tesla, SpaceX, and most recently X (formerly known as Twitter), has gained a reputation for his ability to streamline operations and reduce costs without impacting overall productivity.Trump told Bartiromo that Musk had once said, \"I could cut costs without affecting anybody,\" underscoring the tech mogul's confidence in his ability to optimize efficiency. This statement seemed to resonate with Trump, who has expressed interest in reshaping government operations, especially when it comes to reducing spending.When Bartiromo asked Trump whether Musk might be given a position in his Cabinet, Trump revealed that while Musk might not be interested in a traditional cabinet role, his expertise in cost-cutting could lead to the creation of a new, specialized position.\"We'll have a new position: Secretary of Cost-Cutting,\" Trump suggested, jokingly referring to the possibility of Musk taking on this unique role. \"Elon wants to do that, and we have incredible people. He's running a big business. He can't just say, 'I think I'll go into the Cabinet.' Other people can. He can't, but Elon's a little bit different in that sense.\"Elon Musk is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in the business world, particularly when it comes to improving efficiency and reducing costs. His leadership at companies like Tesla and SpaceX has been marked by aggressive cost-cutting measures that have helped revolutionize industries and deliver record profits. When Musk acquired X, formerly known as Twitter, he applied similar strategies, cutting workforce numbers and rethinking operational expenses to ensure the platform's sustainability.Musk's willingness to take drastic steps, even in the face of public criticism, has earned him both admiration and controversy. His ability to cut costs without compromising the overall growth and success of his companies aligns with Trump's vision of fiscal responsibility in government.Though Trump did not confirm any formal plans to bring Musk into his administration, the notion of a \"Secretary of Cost-Cutting\" reflects Trump's focus on efficiency and reducing wasteful government spending. Throughout his presidency, Trump often spoke about the need to streamline bureaucracy and cut unnecessary expenses in federal agencies. Involving someone like Musk, who has a proven track record of achieving these goals in the private sector, could align with Trump's broader vision of reforming government operations.Musk himself has expressed minimal interest in formal government roles, preferring instead to focus on his numerous business ventures. However, his alignment with Trump's goals of cost efficiency and innovation suggests that there could be opportunities for collaboration in the future.",

    "title": "Will Harris' campaign strategy lead her to electoral success?",
    "content": "Kamala Harris' campaign team is employing different strategies in the final weeks running up to the 2024 US presidential election. Two prominent tactics are distancing herself from President Joe Biden and borrowing themes from Donald Trump's campaign. This raises several questions. Why is Harris' campaign pursuing these strategies? Will they help her win the White House on Nov. 5?Many Democratic leaders believe that President Biden has hindered rather than helped the party's prospects in 2024. Among them is former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who reportedly pressured Biden to exit the race after his poor performance in a debate against Trump early in the summer. His economic record is not impressive and several wars have occurred during his presidency, such as the conflicts in Gaza, Lebanon and between Russia and Ukraine.Historically, friction often arises between the staff of a sitting president and their vice president when the latter runs for president. This occurred in 2000, when Vice President Al Gore distanced himself from President Bill Clinton, particularly after Clinton's involvement in several ethical scandals. In 2024, a similar dynamic is playing out. Harris recognizes that Biden's approval ratings are low, so she is seeking to differentiate herself from him, especially in style. She aims to restore confidence among Democrats who have lost faith in Biden. Her campaign portrays her as a change-maker, conveying that the old guard of the Democratic Party is fading and that she represents the new face of change.Harris recognizes that Biden's approval ratings are low, so she is seeking to differentiate herself from him.Maria MaaloufAdditionally, political observers have noted that Harris is borrowing several themes from her opponent's campaign. For example, she has adopted Trump's idea of eliminating taxation on tips for restaurant workers. Republican strategist Frank Luntz commented: \"Harris is taking pages out of the Republican playbook ... There's an important use of language, especially her focus on small business issues and describing herself as a capitalist. If you listen to these general statements, she sounds like a moderate Republican. The challenge for the Trump campaign is to move away from character attacks and focus on specific issues and her claims.\"On national security, Trump criticizes Biden and Harris for emboldening America's adversaries, such as China, Russia and Iran. Harris has used a similar tactic by accusing Trump of being a weak leader that no foreign head of state respects. She said last month: \"It's well known that Donald Trump is weak and wrong on national security and foreign policy. He admires dictators and wants to be a dictator himself.\"However, these tactics are not necessarily winning over the American public. A political strategist noted that borrowing from an opponent's playbook and relying on personal attacks can be tiresome to voters, who are \"tired of the same old playbook, filled with lies, grievances and name-calling.\" A complete political separation between Harris and the Biden White House is impossible, as she still needs the Democratic base to win the election. For millions of voters, she represents the preservation of Biden's legacy. Moreover, Harris cannot fully agree with Trump on economic policies. For instance, while Trump intends to interfere in Federal Reserve policy, Harris firmly disagrees with this approach.Ultimately, the scope of issues in any presidential campaign should surpass policy differences between a sitting president and their vice president when the latter is running to succeed them. It is also unlikely that voters will see little distinction between two presidential candidates simply because one borrows some themes from the other.",

    "content": "This surge is also attributed to voters' positive assessment of Trump's presidency. The new survey, released just three weeks before Election Day, shows other key findings, including declining popularity for Harris compared to last month, following a significant summertime boost.The latest national NBC News poll reveals a statistical tie between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, with Trump gaining momentum from Republicans returning to support him after a tough debate last month.This surge is also attributed to voters' positive assessment of Trump's presidency. The new survey, released just three weeks before Election Day, shows other key findings, including declining popularity for Harris compared to last month, following a significant summertime boost.It also shows a substantial gap exists between support for Harris and Trump among men and women and that abortion has emerged as a top motivating issue for voters in the 2024 election.Additionally, The Napolitan Institute's national survey reports a tie at 49% for both candidates. These findings suggest a closely contested election.\"As summer has turned to fall, any signs of momentum for Kamala Harris have stopped,\" said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff. \"The race is a dead heat.\"McInturff said \"headwinds\" for Harris have helped narrow the presidential contest, including concerns that the vice president doesn't represent change from President Joe Biden and voters seeing Trump's presidency in a more positive light than Biden's.\"She is asking for another term from the incumbent party,\" McInturff said of Harris.\"The challenge for Kamala Harris: Can she meet the moment and fill in the blanks that voters have about her?\" asked Horwitt, the Democratic pollster.\"The challenge for Donald Trump: Can he make the case that the chaos and personal behavior that bothered so many about his first term will not get in the way of governing and representing America?\" he added.\"The next month will tell whether the candidates can meet these challenges,\" Horwitt said.The latest NBC News poll reveals a dead heat between Harris and Trump, with both candidates tied at 48% in a head-to-head matchup. This is a significant shift from September's poll, where Harris led Trump by 5 points, 49% to 44%.However, it's worth noting that the September result was within the margin of error.When third-party candidates are included, Trump slightly edges out Harris, 47% to 46%, with 7% of voters either undecided or supporting other candidates. This too marks a change from September, where Harris held a 6-point lead in the expanded ballot.The poll, conducted from October 4-8, suggests a tightening race between the two major-party candidates. It's a stark contrast to the previous month's numbers, which had Harris in the lead.With just weeks to go until Election Day, this new poll adds fuel to the already intense speculation surrounding the 2024 presidential election.Though Harris and Trump are tied, when broken down by demographic groups, the numbers tell a different story.Key demographic breakdowns show that regarding racial groups, Harris enjoys overwhelming support from Black voters (84% to 11%). As regards age groups, Harris leads among younger voters aged 18-34 (57% to 37%).As for education level, Harris has an edge among white voters with college degrees (55% to 41%).It noted that for geographic location, Trump dominates among rural voters (75% to 23%) while for gender gap, a significant gap exists between male and female voters, with women supporting Harris by 14 points (55% to 41%) and men backing Trump by 16 points (56% to 40%).These disparities highlight the complexities of the election, with various groups showing strong preferences for each candidate.",

If you are a Muslim and you vote for... eii, eii, eii. The president of the National House of Chiefs said if you go to pastors, they should pray for you.

    "content": "By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.The expression goes, \"a house divided against itself cannot stand.\" Perhaps that's why some family law attorneys are seeing a spike in divorces this election cycle.A relatively new type of battle has emerged as politics becomes a fiercely divisive influence -- one that pits spouses against each other, not over financial disputes or infidelity, but over the fraught terrain of ideological differences. With contention strengthening each election cycle, now partisan politics are increasingly cited as irreconcilable differences in relationships and are becoming central to co-parenting debates.\"I'm often hearing from my clients of the constant strife and differences in political viewpoints, a disagreement in how to parent or a major misalignment on the future direction of their children's life. The parenting perspectives of liberal v. conservative, structured v. unstructured, and political beliefs do come out when dealing with co-parenting issues,\" Yonatan Levoritz, a Washington, D.C.-based family attorney and founder of Levoritz Law Firm, said in a press release.In a Monday interview with Fox News Digital, Levoritz noted a surge in separations rooted in political discord over the past three election cycles. He observed that as political ideologies grow further ingrained in societal values, polarizing issues such as abortion, drugs and sexuality are breaking down families.TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT VICTIM JAMES COPENHAVER 'SAD' WITH STATE OF 'POLITICAL DIVISION' IN US\"As  become more polarized, it's very difficult because their positions become more entrenched,\" he said.\"Therefore, what's happening is that they're basically digging themselves into holes in litigation with an unwillingness to compromise... You have to compromise because you can't get 100% of what you want in most cases,\" he continued.The gridlock is leading to a growing number of people stubbornly declining what's negotiated, and demanding total control as they accuse the other party of an inability to make good decisions, he explained.Levoritz's experience isn't isolated either. Cheryl New, a family law attorney based in Bethesda, Maryland, has seen an unprecedented number of divorces related to ideological differences compared to other points in her 35-year career, according to an Axios report from July.\" 'Who do you want for president?' It branches into many other areas of how you have to relate to your spouse,\" she said.Consider a conservative father and a liberal mother, divided on whether to allow their transgender child to openly express their espoused gender identity or, perhaps, a conservative mother and a liberal father disagreeing on the prospect of their sixteen-year-old daughter terminating an unplanned pregnancy.\"A lot of the divorces are being caused by hot-button issues like abortion. I've heard that one at least four or five times in the past two or three months,\" Levoritz said, elaborating on a case involving a man who sought to divorce his wife after she had two abortions without his permission.THREATS TO US FEDERAL JUDGES HAVE DOUBLED SINCE 2021 THANKS TO POLITICAL DIVISION\"I've had a couple of cases where marijuana was an issue .

When it comes to dating, one parent may favor stricter rules for their teenager, while the other may impose more relaxed rules.Attorney Jessica Markham, also based in the D.C. area, even cited COVID as a factor in Axios' report, with disagreements over vaccinating and masking coming into play. She said many of the divisions that started then have escalated since.Markham also told the outlet that political ideologies have been used to argue that one parent is unfit for custody, particularly in instances where one parent holds allegedly extreme viewpoints or shares \"conspiracy theories\" in online posts.In Levoritz's experience, the problem existed to a lesser degree when former President Barack Obama and Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, faced off in 2012, but several issues that are now hotly-contested weren't overly pressing issues at the time.TRUMP MAKES A BOLD PREDICTION ABOUT THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION\"We had more people aligned on the issue about marijuana being an illegal drug. Now, over time, that's changed,\" he said as an example.\"Back then, I would say people were more easygoing. They were more willing to compromise too.\"His message to parents currently locked in custody battles? Acknowledge the child's humanity.\"People have to understand that the child doesn't belong to them. It doesn't belong to mom, doesn't belong to dad. It doesn't belong to a third party who may be involved. The child is a human being, and that's something that has to be recognized by everybody.\"\"And, to a certain extent, you have to let the child out of the hostility and outside the fray of what's going on and allow the parent, to a certain extent, to come to their own conclusion or, if necessary, to try setting ground rules that allow for each parent to make the most important decisions to them and just let the other parent be and take a hands-off approach, despite their political motivations.\"",

    "title": "Presidents of the United States: James Buchanan, the president who fiddled as the Civil War broke out",
    "content": "Editor's Note: This is part of a series of profiles taking a closer look at US presidents ahead of the 2024 presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.Some call James Buchanan the worst US president in history.Many point the finger squarely at Buchanan for allowing the wounds of the north and south to fester into rot - which ultimately resulted in the US Civil War.Buchanan also remains the only president to be elected from Pennsylvania and the sole occupant of the White House to remain a bachelor.The US First Lady at the time was Buchanan's niece Harriet Lane.Buchanan was born on April 23, 1791, near Pennsylvania's Mercersburg.His parents were James Buchanan - a shopkeeper - and Elizabeth Speer.Both were of Scottish descent.Buchanan attended Pennsylvania's Dickinson College after which he studied law and opened up a practice.Buchanan's personal life remains a source of mystery.In 1819, Buchanan got engaged to Anne C Coleman, who belonged to a well-off Pennsylvania family.However, Buchanan, 28, called the relationship off.Coleman passed away soon after in what was possibly a suicide.Buchanan would stay single for the rest of his life.PoliticsBuchanan, who belonged to the Federalist Party, first served in the Pennsylvania State Legislature.He was then elected to the US House of Representatives, where he was on the powerful House Judiciary Committee.After the party dissolved, Buchanan closely aligned himself with the emerging Democratic Party and its star Andrew Jackson - whom he helped carry the state in 1828 and 1832.Jackson rewarded Buchanan's loyalty by appointing him the minister to Russia.Buchanan, after returning from Russia, became a Senator from Pennsylvania in 1834.He would serve three terms in the Senate where he chaired the Foreign Relations Committee.Though Buchanan was eyeing the presidency in 1844 and made a run, the nomination went to James K Polk.Polk, who won the presidency, would then appoint Buchanan as his Secretary of State in exchange for his support in Pennsylvania.Buchanan's time as Secretary of State under Polk - both believers in the concept of Manifest Destiny - saw America annex Texas and the breakout of the US-Mexico war.In 1848, Buchanan yet again attempted to win the Democratic nomination but was denied. Afterwards, he returned to his home state.In 1852, Buchanan made a third attempt to win the nomination.This time, Buchanan was stymied by his rival Stephen Douglas.Meanwhile, a dark horse by the name of Franklin Pierce emerged to win the nomination.Though he would never forgive Douglas, in long run things worked out for Buchanan.Pierce now tapped Buchanan as minister to Great Britain - a post he would hold from 1853 to 1856.It was at this time that Buchanan and other foreign ministers drafted the Ostend Manifesto - which recommended that America seize Cuba from Spain.Buchanan being away from the turmoil and turbulence in America during this period is what finally won him the Democratic nomination in 1856.Buchanan would defeat Republican candidate John Frémont and finally achieve his long-awaited goal of becoming US president.Time in officeBuchanan came into office with the United States bitterly divided and facing perhaps the most difficult question of the time - slavery.He proved completely the wrong man for the moment.At the time, the Supreme Court was considering the issue of slavery.Specifically, whether the government could restrict slavery in the territories.Buchanan, is a terrible breach of ethics, began corresponding with one of the Supreme Court justices - and got a hint about the impending decision.Buchanan in his inauguration speech referred to the issue as \"happily, a matter of but little practical importance\" and that the court would resolve it \"speedily and finally.\"Then, days later, the US Supreme Court released its Dred Scott decision.The infamous verdict stated that black people, even free ones, were not citizens of the United States and could never be.The decision also struck down the Missouri Compromise of 1850 - which sought to settle the question of slavery between north and south - as illegal.It restricted the US government from banning slavery in the territories.The decision delighted the north and caused an uproar in the north with Republican William Seward, who would later serve as Abraham Lincoln's Secretary of State, accusing the Supreme Court justices and the president of \"conspiracy, tyranny, deception, and subversion.\"Buchanan's response was to try to placate the south - which after all was his political base - through a series of compromises including seeking to admit Kansas to the Union as a slave territory.Instead, Buchanan aroused the ire of the Republicans and even a section of his own party.The Democratic Party split into two and the Republicans nominated Abraham Lincoln - who would win the presidency.Seeing the writing on the wall, southern states began seceding one after the other.Buchanan, meanwhile, did little to stop them.After Lincoln was sworn in, Buchanan returned to Pennsylvania and retired.LegacyThough Buchanan was certain he would be vindicated by history, events proved otherwise.",

    "content": "The 2024 US presidential election is shaping up to be one of the closest races in recent history, with a complex mix of candidates, key issues, and political drama at play. As US citizens prepare to head to the polls on 5 November, the stakes are high: the election will determine the direction of the country on critical matters such as the economy, healthcare, climate change, and foreign policy for the next four years.For the occasion, we have prepared an explainer series to break down everything you need to know about this critical election, with two articles published each week up until election day.The first part of the series outlines the very basics of the electoral system. This includes simple explanations like when US citizens head to the polls, the difference between in-person and absentee voting, the eligibility criteria for candidates, and the term limits for the highest office in the States.Part two is a deep dive into the more intricate aspects of the system. Here we dissect the infamous Electoral College, how voting districts work, what swing states are, and how each of these elements plays a key part in deciding the US presidential race.The third part of the series is all about election day, providing an overview of what to expect - and notably when to expect it. Voter turnout, exit polls, media institutions calling results, and candidates addressing their base, consider this article your handy helper to keep open on 5 November.With part four we start zooming in on the candidates vying for the Oval Office, starting with their road to the nomination. We look back on the Democratic and Republican national conventions where Kamala Harris and Donald Trump presented their running mates and where each ticket was officially confirmed.The fifth part opposes Harris and Trump both in terms of their track records, as well as their proposed policies. Here we break down not only what both candidates have to offer, but also how their ideas are resonating with voters in the polls and - perhaps more importantly - with donors.Finally, part six will outline the crucial role that third-party candidates may play in the 2024 White House race. Although the modern US presidential election is usually a bipartisan fight, the ability to divide the electorate and tilt the balance in a candidate's favour is not to be underestimated, as history has shown.RTL Today will continue its regular coverage of the White House race in the run-up to election day. From there we will set up an additional live ticker to get you all the latest updates as soon as they break. Here you can also expect to find the first results, video and image material, as well as a brief summary of the situation at different moments in time.Also, we will ensure to provide some fun election facts throughout the day, so tune in whenever you are looking for a somewhat lighter take on things. If you are looking to read any or all of our previous US election articles, then you can easily access them via the dedicated banner on the right side of our homepage, which will go online in the days leading up to 5 November.Thanks to our colleagues at RTL.lu, we will also be able to provide direct updates from the US, with our reporters completing various road trips across the battleground states before eventually heading to Washington DC for the big day.",

Sir, learn to speak well,\" NAPO stated in Twi.He continued, \"After making this statement, Mahama visited a chief, the Goasomanhene, who insulted us. The Goasomanhene said, 'If you (Mahama) come to power, arrest NPP officials who looted from the state.' But the person standing near him, wasn't he the one involved in a road contract bribe scandal? Has he been arrested?\" he questioned.NAPO further argued that if corrupt officials are to be jailed, Mahama himself would be first in line.\"If you are saying people should be arrested, then Mahama would be going to jail... Don't say things that, when they happen, Ghanaians will wonder, 'God, didn't you say you are forgiving?' No! If the NDC plans to jail NPP officials, they themselves are already in jail,\" NAPO added.What the Goasomanhene Said:Nana Kwasi Bosomprah supported former President Mahama's comments on the lack of candor from chiefs and the clergy regarding the performance of the Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo administration.During an engagement with the NDC Flagbearer and members of the Ahafo Regional House of Chiefs on Wednesday, September 18, 2024, the Goasomanhene expressed concerns that pastors and clergy were not being honest about the current state of affairs in the country.\"Our pastors and chiefs are not telling things as they are. Today, everyone is pretending as if they are not Ghanaians,\" the chief lamented in Twi.The paramount chief urged Mahama to recover state resources looted under the Akufo-Addo-led government and prosecute those responsible.\"I am pleading with you, if you get the opportunity to be president, go after everyone who has looted state money because there is none left except the little remaining in people's pockets and hidden under their beds. So, we are begging you, jail whoever deserves to be jailed,\" he appealed.Watch NAPO's remarks and those of the chief in the videos below:",

Bradshaw previews the biggest games of the week and then covers them at halftime for the network, along with Michael Strahan, Howie Long and Jimmy Johnson, among other personalities.

    "title": "Evangelicals Flock to Washington to Pray for America... and Trump",
    "content": "The final days of the 2024 presidential election have begun to take on a decidedly different and some might say alarming tone. To be sure, there is still plenty of talk about tax rates and foreign policy, but there is something else in the air and it was on full display in Washington, DC yesterday when tens of thousands of evangelical Christians gathered on the National Mall for a day of prayers and beseeching the Powers That Be to intervene and help to save America. And how might He do that? By not simply saving America, but by protecting Donald Trump from harm. The event was billed as \"A Million Women,\" but both genders were well represented. The tone quickly took a dark turn, however when the election was described as \"a last stand moment\" to save the nation from the forces of darkness. (NBC News)Tens of thousands of evangelical Christians gathered on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., on Saturday to pray for America's atonement and for Donald Trump's return to the White House.Organizers of the event, billed \"A Million Women,\" described the gathering -- and next month's presidential election -- as \"a last stand moment\" to save the nation from forces of darkness. For hours, the gathered masses sang worship songs, waved flags symbolizing their belief that America was founded as an explicitly Christian nation and prayed aloud for Jesus to intercede on behalf of Trump in November.There seemed to be few mentions of policy differences between the candidates. Comparisons between the economy Under Trump and Biden/Harris were few and far between. Crime rates were only dealt with as an underlying symptom of a larger, looming threat. The Harris/Walz ticket is a harbinger of doom, while Donald Trump is the Chosen One who can carry the banner of goodness and light forward. In other words, only God can save America from a path leading toward darkness and Donald J. Trump is God's man on the battlefield who will lead that charge.Am I the only one who finds this a bit more than simply disturbing? To be clear, I'm not here pretending to be some official interpreter of the Will of The Almighty. But I have always found Donald Trump to be something of an odd fit for the evangelical Christians. It's not that Trump strikes me as particularly demonic or anything of the sort, but he was a bit late to the party when you look at his pre-politics history when he was working on The Apprentice and hanging out with the Clintons and his Hollywood friends.For her part, Harris has been fairly quiet about issues of faith. That doesn't make her \"a bad person,\" but she also hasn't exactly been out there speaking in tongues and hanging with the Holy Rollers. If Kamala Harris spells doom for a god-fearing society, it seems far more likely that four more years of her policies will doom us far more surely than some secret series of demonic dances she's secretly performing in the basement of her campaign HQ.This contest is a target-rich environment in terms of the stark differences between the candidates and the results their policies produced. This image of Trump as Savior (or at least the Savior's chosen warrior here on this Mortal Plain simply feels off the mark. And it might make some voters who are otherwise inclined to support his policies think twice about it.",

    "title": "Presidents of the United States: Abraham Lincoln, the saviour of the Union",
    "content": "Editor's Note: This profile is part of a series taking a closer look at US presidents ahead of the 2024 presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States, is revered as one of the greatest American leaders for his role in preserving the Union during the Civil War and for his efforts to end slavery in the United States.Known as \"The Great Emancipator,\" Lincoln's leadership, eloquence, and moral clarity helped steer the nation through its most significant crisis. His assassination in 1865 cut short his presidency but cemented his legacy as a national hero.Lincoln's political rise and personal lifeAbraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, in a log cabin in Hardin County, Kentucky (now LaRue County), to Thomas and Nancy Lincoln, both of whom were farmers.His early life was marked by poverty, and he received little formal education, though he was an avid reader. Lincoln's family moved to Indiana and later to Illinois, where he worked various jobs, including as a rail-splitter, store clerk, and postmaster, before deciding to study law on his own.In 1832, Lincoln began his political career with an unsuccessful bid for the Illinois state legislature, but he won election two years later in 1834 as a Whig.Abraham Lincoln married Mary Todd in 1842, and together they had four sons: Robert, Edward, William, and Thomas (known as Tad). Only Robert lived to adulthood, with the others dying young.Lincoln was a devoted, though often absent, father due to his political career. His marriage to Mary Todd was marked by deep affection but also significant strain, especially following the death of their son Willie in 1862.During his time in the Illinois General Assembly, Lincoln developed a reputation as a capable legislator and a gifted speaker. In 1837, he moved to Springfield, Illinois, where he established a successful law practice and deepened his involvement in state politics.Lincoln served a single term in the US House of Representatives from 1847 to 1849, where he was critical of the Mexican-American War and supported the Wilmot Proviso, which sought to ban slavery in territories acquired from Mexico. After leaving Congress, Lincoln returned to his law practice but became increasingly active in politics as tensions over slavery grew in the 1850s.The Republican party risesThe passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854, which allowed for the expansion of slavery into new territories, rekindled Lincoln's political ambitions.He strongly opposed the spread of slavery, believing it to be morally wrong, though he did not initially advocate for its immediate abolition in states where it already existed.Lincoln's speeches during the famed Lincoln-Douglas Debates in 1858, where he debated US Senator Stephen A Douglas on the issue of slavery, brought him national attention even though he lost the Illinois Senate race.In 1860, Lincoln's growing stature in the new Republican Party and his moderate views on slavery made him a viable candidate for the presidency. He was nominated as the party's candidate and, in a contentious election, Lincoln won the presidency with a minority of the popular vote, thanks in part to a divided Democratic Party.A Lincoln presidency amid the Civil WarLincoln took office on March 4, 1861, at a time when the country was on the brink of civil war. Following his election, seven Southern states seceded from the Union and formed the Confederate States of America.Lincoln's immediate goal was to preserve the Union, and he rejected any compromises that would have allowed the further spread of slavery.The Civil War officially began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina. Throughout the war, Lincoln's leadership was tested as he grappled with military setbacks, internal dissent, and the immense toll of the conflict.He initially framed the war as a fight to save the Union rather than as a war to end slavery. However, as the conflict wore on, Lincoln increasingly recognised that the abolition of slavery was central to restoring the nation.'The Great Emancipator'On January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared that all enslaved people in the Confederate states \"shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free.\"While the proclamation did not immediately free all enslaved people, it fundamentally changed the nature of the war, aligning it with the cause of human freedom and preventing European nations from recognising the Confederacy.Lincoln continued to advocate for the abolition of slavery, and by the end of the war, he supported the passage of the 13th Amendment to the US Constitution, which would permanently abolish slavery throughout the United States. The amendment was passed by Congress in January 1865 and ratified later that year.Lincoln's 272 wordsLincoln's presidency was defined by his firm leadership during the Civil War. Though he faced significant criticism for his handling of the war and his suspension of habeas corpus, Lincoln remained steadfast in his commitment to preserving the Union.He worked closely with his generals, eventually finding success with Ulysses S Grant, who led Union forces to key victories in the latter years of the conflict.Lincoln also delivered some of the most memorable speeches in American history, most notably the Gettysburg Address on November 19, 1863.In just 272 words, Lincoln reaffirmed the principles of liberty and equality upon which the nation was founded, framing the war as a test of whether a nation \"conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal\" could survive.First US president to be assassinatedLincoln's efforts to bring the war to a successful conclusion bore fruit when Robert E Lee, the commander of Confederate forces, surrendered to Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865, effectively ending the war.However, Lincoln would not live to see the full reconstruction of the country. On April 14, 1865, just five days after Lee's surrender, Lincoln was shot by Confederate sympathiser John Wilkes Booth while attending a play at Ford's Theatre in Washington, DC. He died the following day, making him the first US president to be assassinated.Also Watch:Lincoln's death plunged the nation into mourning, but his legacy as the leader who preserved the Union and ended slavery was secure.He is consistently ranked as one of the greatest presidents in American history for his leadership, vision, and moral courage during one of the most challenging periods in the nation's history.The legacy of Abraham LincolnAbraham Lincoln's legacy as the \"Great Emancipator\" and the US president who preserved the Union is unmatched. His leadership during the Civil War and his role in ending slavery fundamentally transformed the United States.His eloquence, humility, and determination continue to inspire Americans and people around the world. Though he faced significant opposition and challenges during his presidency, his dedication to the principles of freedom and equality left an indelible mark on the nation's history.",

    "title": "'I love all of them, even the people that hate me.' Springfield Haitians weigh their future as Trump threatens deportations | CNN",
    "content": "Springfield, Ohio CNN --It's just past 4am.Daniel Aula is in his one room apartment praying, thankful he's alive, and thankful he's heading to work.Aula, originally from Haiti, has been living in Springfield over a year now. He knew about the quiet Ohio city through a friend and heard it had not only a low cost of living but also great work opportunities to match.Why not?It's a world better than what he was running from. Aula had been a police officer back in crime-wracked Haiti, until he wasn't. His house was burned down, he went into hiding, and was told people were coming to kill him.\"I know that. There are two friends who let me know that,\" he told CNN.\"My life was not safe,\" he told CNN. \"I decide to leave Haiti.\"While Aula has found opportunity in Springfield, he's also found himself in the middle of a bitter national debate on immigration heading into November's election, fueled in this case largely by rumors and threats.The city of Springfield estimates there are between 12,000 and 15,000 immigrants living in Clark County, the county that holds Springfield, most of them believed to be Haitians arriving in just the past four years.The image of a city dramatically altered by immigration has been seized upon by former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance -- who have made criticism of the Biden administration's immigration policy a cornerstone of their campaign.Trump falsely told about 67 million viewers that Haitians in Springfield were \"eating the dogs\" and \"eating the cats,\" during the presidential debate on September 10.And Vance has made repeated false claims about Haitians, fueling rumors that they kill pets and do not have legal status in the country.Trump is already threatening to deport Springfield's Haitian residents if elected.\"You have to remove the people, and you have to bring them back to their own country,\" he told News Nation in an early October interview.Video Ad FeedbackHe was a police officer in Haiti. Everything changed when he was told people were coming to kill him01:08 - Source: CNNA shot at a new lifeSpringfield is Aula's chance at a new life. He's taking English classes, but he's had so much to learn, namely how to get a job. Many in Springfield have been eager to help him, and to hire him.Not long after he got to Springfield, Aula started working at Pentaflex, a company focused mainly on building metal stampings and assemblies for safety related functions like the brakes on a truck.CEO Ross McGregor, whose family has been involved in manufacturing here for decades, has nothing but praise for his Haitian employees. To lose them would be a blow to his business, he told CNN. McGregor hired his first Haitian worker \"three, four years ago\" not because he sought them out specifically but because he needed dependable workers.\"Retail demand was climbing through the roof,\" McGregor told CNN. \"We were having a real hard time with people that would apply for a job and then they wouldn't show up on the floor.\"\"Or they'd come in and they'd work for half a day and they'd just leave,\" he said. \"That is, you know, a real problem when you're running a production facility. You need to have a reliable workforce that you can count on to be at work every day.\"In contrast, his Haitian employees seem eager to work, he says. He walked CNN through his factory, pointing out work instructions available both in English and Haitian Creole.\"I want to dispel one thing,\" he told CNN unprompted: \"We don't bring (Haitian workers) in at a substandard wage and work them and pay them any less than we would any other employee,\" he said. \"There are no Haitians that are taking anybody's jobs. I mean, if you want a job, you can get a job. And I just encourage people to have a little bit of empathy for where the Haitians are coming from.\"\"I don't know a person in this town that wouldn't want to get the hell out of (Haiti),\" he said.The rapid arrival of Haitians in Springfield has created both growing opportunities and pains. Some would come with any population increase; some have been specific to the culture differences and language barriers.Multiple city and state officials point to the population influx of Haitians as a major boost to Springfield's economy.Over the last several years, \"We've seen more growth than we've seen for decades past,\" said Springfield City Manager Bryan Heck, including a \"revitalization and resurgence of our downtown.\"The growing pains, however, were maybe encapsulated best by Springfield Mayor Rob Rue during a July 2024 City Commission meeting where he told a resident, \"We were not in control of this.\"Video Ad Feedback'It boggles my mind:' CEO reacts to Springfield Haitians getting 'free ride'00:59 - Source: CNN\"We didn't get a chance to have an infrastructure in place if there are going to be 20,000 more people from '20 to '25 -- we didn't get to do that. So, the most frustrating thing is we've got to spend tax dollars that were already in a flat budget, that we've got to vote on to try to take care of 15,000 more folks that are here and make sure that everybody has a safe environment to be in,\" he said.Springfield's growing population has put pressure on services like health care, including wait times for things like blood pressure screenings, vaccinations and more. Visits requiring interpreters also take longer, making lines stretch even further. It's part of why the state of Ohio helped open a mobile healthcare clinic, to try and ease some of those pressure points. State officials say they saw close to 100 patients in about a week's time, which exceeded expectations.\"The system's been strained for a couple of years, we just now have people paying more attention,\" said Chris Cook, health commissioner for Clark County, which includes Springfield.Maternal health care has been an especially poignant issue because of \"poor prenatal care\" in Haiti, he said. \"You've got moms who are walking in the hospital that are in labor. They're ready to give birth in probably the next couple hours, and they've never had a single prenatal visit,\" Cook told CNN.Cook said they also encourage new mothers to be part of their Women Infants and Children (WIC) supplemental nutrition program and hope to have appointments within 10 days of the baby's birth. But over time, waits grew to two months, he said.\"That's not just our Haitian moms,\" Cook said. \"Everybody's in the same line.\"Another major area of concern in Springfield has been housing, with signs of stress dating all the way back to 2018 in regard to availability and cost -- years before Haitians began arriving after the Biden administration approved Temporary Protective Status in 2021 due to the violence, human rights abuses, and dire economic situation in Haiti.City Manager Bryan Heck sent a letter to Sens. Sherrod of Ohio Brown and Tim Scott of South Carolina -- then cc'd Vance in July of 2024 -- regarding \"a significant strain,\" regarding housing.\"I didn't call it a migrant crisis. I didn't call it an immigration crisis. It's a housing crisis,\" Heck told CNN. \"The pace of growth for our community is just -- was not sustainable and continues to not be sustainable unless we get some additional support from the state and federal government,\" Heck said.Rent also went up, partly from the increased demand of a new population but driven also by the \"greed of landlords,\" as Mayor Rue put it during a July City Commission meeting. Prices were also likely affected by nationwide inflation in recent years.Springfield, Ohio Mayor Rob Rue speaks to residents during a town hall about the 2024 presidential election's focus on the town's influx of Haitian immigrants, on September 24, 2024.Dominic Gwinn/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty Images/FileSpringfield, Ohio commissioner Bryan Heck speaks to residents during a town hall about the 2024 presidential election's focus on the town's influx of Haitian immigrants, on September 24, 2024.Dominic Gwinn/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty Images/FileHaitian immigrant and US Navy veteran Jaob Payen listens neighbors in Springfield, Ohio deride Haitian immigrants during a town hall about the 2024 presidential election's focus on the town's influx of Haitian immigrants, on September 24, 2024.Dominic Gwinn/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty Images/FileWhile Trump has claimed the influx brought \"dangerous\" criminality, Clark County Prosecuting Attorney Daniel Driscoll, a Republican, told CNN last month that was not the case.\"During the time that I've been with the prosecutor's office, which is 21 years now, we have not had any murders involving the Haitian community -- as either the victims or as the perpetrators of those murders.\" He confirmed to CNN this week this was still the case.Overall, according to the City of Springfield, \"Haitians are more likely to be the victims of crime than they are to be the perpetrators in our community. Clark County jail data shows there are 199 inmates in our county jail this week. Two of them are Haitian. That's 1% (as of Sept. 8).\"Andy Wilson, director of the Ohio Department of Public Safety, said at a September press conference, \"The No. 1 issue we have in the public safety space with the Haitians, it's not crime, it's not violence -- it's the driving, that's the public safety issue. So, what we want to do is we want to get driver's education to that population.\"It's an issue that state officials have found hard to immediately tackle, given that adults in Ohio can test for a driver's license and receive it without having to go through a formal training program.Governor Mike DeWine recently directed the Ohio State Highway Patrol to support Springfield Police with traffic enforcement \"to address the increase in dangerous driving in Springfield by inexperienced Haitian drivers and all others who disregard traffic laws.\"While some Springfieldians gripe about the effects of immigration, others are stepping up. Cook and local United Way director Kerry Lee Pedraza, who grew up here, today co-chair what's known as the \"Haitian Coalition,\" which is a combination of private and public entities working behind the scenes to find solutions that work for everyone in Springfield, not just Haitians.In 2022, at their first meeting, Pedraza said there were 45 people from different organizations who showed up. They've only grown since then, but part of the problem recently is they have not had the \"financial resource to help us to continue to do it, and to do it at a speed where everyone in the community is going to feel that there's some relief.\"Regardless, the multilateral level of coordination across sectors has been \"incredibly effective,\" she said. \"It actually could probably be a master class of how any community needs to come together around, take any social issue, and work together to create a really good solution.\"\"Today it might be the Haitian community, tomorrow it could be a different community,\" Pedraza told CNN.Haitians sit down to eat their meal at a Haitian restaurant in Springfield, Ohio, on September 12, 2024.Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images/FileLiving under the shadow of threatsHaiti has been ravaged by violent gang warfare in recent years. Aula's wife and daughter are still in hiding there, he told CNN.In early October, at least 70 people were killed, including three infants, in a gang attack in central Haiti, according to the United Nations Human Rights Office.The UN reports more than 3,600 people have been killed so far this year. Hundreds of thousands of Haitians have been forced to flee their homes after gang attacks.Given Haiti's anarchial unrest in recent years, Haitians were added to a Biden-Harris administration parole program, limited to only a few countries, that allows vetted participants to enter the United States as long as they are sponsored by US residents.Others have Temporary Protected Status (TPS), a renewable program that shields some at-risk nationalities from deportation and allows them to live and work in the country for a limited period of time.Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas designated Haitians for Temporary Protected Status starting in 2021 and has subsequently extended and redesignated Haiti through February 2026.Those in the United States under the parole program are able to apply for TPS.Video Ad FeedbackHaitian man shares why Trump's rhetoric has scared him01:10 - Source: CNN\"We frequently see people who have just entered within the past month or two,\" said Katie Kersh, a senior attorney at Advocates for Basic Legal Equality (ABLE), where she specializes in immigration and civil rights and has represented Haitians for years.She and her team have been working to provide free legal clinics assisting Haitians in Springfield and beyond who have arrived in the past two years assisting them with applications for TPS, asylum, work permits and more.Kersh said Haitians do hear Trump's comments about deportations, and even she \"can't tell anyone that there's no likelihood that there could be some sort of mass enforcement action.\"However, a broader revocation of previously granted parole or TPS would \"be definitely challenged in the courts and probably successfully. So that's a big thing that we're trying to tell people, that it would be really, really procedurally and legally difficult for that to happen,\" Kersh said.Still, many Haitian residents in Springfield live in fear of Trump's threat of removal, unsure over their future and their safety.Dieff-Son Lebon is one of those Haitians. CNN met Lebon as he got off work at a construction site before heading to dinner at one of the multiple Haitian restaurants that have opened in Springfield.But first, he made a stop with an immigration advocate to consider his options if there was any mass deportation effort that included him. He's been a little more nervous than usual lately.\"As I was walking down the road, a white man drove by and yelled Trump!\" Lebon said in Creole. Lebon took it as a threat.\"I was scared! Because I was on the street, I was going to buy something, and I was also walking on foot, so I was scared, and I hurried to get home,\" he told CNN.He said he had never dealt with anything like that since living in Springfield.\"It was peaceful here, understand, there were no such things. Everything started after the remark,\" he said.The \"remark\" in question came during the presidential debate in early September, but it all likely stemmed from August 28, 2024.A Springfield resident reported to police that she suspected her Haitian neighbors of chopping up her cat after finding \"meat\" in the backyard.Soon after, social media posts began circulating about pet-eating Haitians and were even promoted by neo-Nazi groups, some of which have shown up to Springfield in person marching against Haitians being there.Just days after the initial police report, the owner's cat \"Miss Sassy\" was found safe in her basement. While the literal cat was found, the metaphorical cat was out of the bag, and the claims spread far and fast, eventually making its way onto the debate stage.First Vance's team picked up the rumors, with the senator claiming, \"You have a lot of people saying 'my pets are being abducted'\" and \"'slaughtered right in front of us.'\"And then Trump made the claim at the debate.The claims have been refuted by Springfield officials and City Manager Bryan Heck told CNN that Vance's team knew there was no substantiated evidence.Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance speaks to a crowd in Leesport, Pennsylvania, on September 21, 2024. Throughout the rally Vance repeated claims regarding Hatian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio.Matthew Hatcher/Getty Images\"I had a call from one of Vance's staffers and asked, 'Hey, are the rumors true of pets being taken and eaten by the immigrants in your community?' I said no,\" Heck told CNN. \"It's a baseless claim,\" he added.\"To see that continue to be retweeted by Vance himself the next day and then sitting there watching the presidential debate\" was \"difficult,\" Heck said.Days after the presidential debate, city buildings and schools were hit with multiple threats of violence, prompting evacuations and cancellations of events. While state officials later said these threats ended up being hoaxes, many \"from overseas,\" they still prompted real evacuations and warranted a beefing up of security both for city officials and schools.\"To have threats thrown at my family and thrown at my house to explain to my 12-year-old why a bomb dog has to sniff our house to see if something is explosive there. That's tough,\" Heck told CNN.Gov. DeWine's 'obligation to tell the truth'Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine was born in Springfield, Ohio. While he grew up in a town nearby, he took his now-wife, Ohio first lady Fran DeWine, on dates to Springfield when they were both in high school.The DeWines fund a school in the dangerous Cité Soleil, an impoverished neighborhood in Haitian capital Port-au-Prince -- an area entirely under gang control, where thousands of civilians live as a captive population.DeWine is also a Trump-supporting Republican. All those aspects of his life have collided this past month in a way he simply described as \"kind of strange.\"\"As governor, I have an obligation to tell the truth and talk about Springfield,\" DeWine told CNN.While DeWine readily acknowledges not everything has been perfect as the Haitian population has grown, he also said it's unmistakable that \"if you look at Springfield's growth in the last few years, that's been fueled, a lot of it by the Haitian immigrants who were taking jobs that were open.\"Video Ad FeedbackOhio Governor on why he plans to vote for Trump in 2024 election01:05 - Source: CNNHe even said he had one employer \"look me in the eye\" and tell him, \"'I don't think our company really would be here today if it wasn't for Haitians.'\"Historically, Haitians are hardly the only group to immigrate to Springfield. For starters, \"The Gammon House\" in Springfield was a stop on the Underground Railroad, serving as a symbol of a step toward freedom and a new life for the freed slaves in America. Some of the first Greek establishments opened in Springfield in the early 1900s, but the area also saw an influx of Germans, Irish, and later on Hispanics.In 1970 the population in Springfield was around 82,000. The 2020 federal census showed a drop to around 58,000.\"Pumping resources into the community is how communities grow. This is how we grow,\" DeWine told CNN.While Trump's deportation threat may not be easily carried out, DeWine believes removing Haitians from Springfield would not be good for the city.\"It would be a mistake to kick these people out who are working, who are raising their family, who are productive members of society. I think that's an economic mistake. I think it's a moral mistake as well,\" DeWine told CNN.But not enough of a mistake to change his vote.\"I support my party,\" he said. \"Going against the nominee of the party, I think makes me a less effective governor of the state of Ohio.\"\"I think the decision to who you support for president is based upon multiple issues,\" he said.And, he said, he is supporting the Haitian community.\"I make my position very, very clear. I don't think they should be thrown out. I think it would be a dramatic mistake. I think it's wrong,\" he told CNN.Daniel Aula's fate may hang on how America votes on November 5. But he is sanguine about the heated rhetoric around his community's presence in town -- and still, despite everything, grateful to be here.\"The world, it's like a village,\" Aula said. \"Like a village, angry people and happy people have to live together.\"\"Immigrants cannot take the place of people, American citizens,\" he told CNN while driving through Springfield. \"They just come to collaborate.\"\"Even the people (who are) angry about me, I love all of them,\" Aula said. \"I love all of them, even the people that hate me.\"Reporting contributed by CNN's Catherine E.

    "title": "Colorado's Elections Chief Took on Trump. She Needed Extra Security As She Gave Birth",
    "content": "In late August, Colorado's top election official, Democratic Secretary of State Jena Griswold, was admitted to the hospital for her scheduled C-section, as she and her husband were, naturally, thrilled about the imminent birth of Griswold's first child. They had gone through unsuccessful IVF treatments, but were able to conceive a baby boy outside of the process.But not long after entering the hospital on a Wednesday, for a stay that would ultimately last until that Sunday evening, the state's highest ranking election official says she started to notice something strange. The presence of her armed security detail -- a mix of Colorado State Patrol and private security personnel -- suddenly \"doubled,\" Griswold tells Rolling Stone. New guards she didn't recognize were swiftly added to her protective detail.It would be days before she'd learn why this was happening, and whether it had anything to do with former President Donald Trump. Griswold had argued Trump should be legally barred from her state's 2024 ballot due to his role in inciting the deadly \"insurrection\" at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.\"Within hours of being wheeled into surgery, the Colorado State Patrol told my team they were doubling the time that they would be providing me with security,\" Griswold says. \"So security was literally sitting in front of the hospital room door and in front of the hospital as we spent the first hours and first days with our new baby.\"In a moment when the new mother should have been focusing solely on her recovery from surgery and on her newborn, she was left wondering: why?\"They don't just put extended security coverage on you for no reason,\" she says. \"I suspected something was wrong.\" While in the hospital, the Colorado secretary of state and her staff were initially informed by authorities that the boost in security was done to, in general terms, \"make me more comfortable and accommodate my security requests,\" she recalls. \"It added a very real extra layer of stress...  concern about what was happening.\"Griswold, recounting how surreal these moments in the hospital were, says \"it's hard to describe\" what the situation felt like. She had just delivered her newborn son. She was already checked into the hospital, even before the surge in security personnel, as \"a confidential patient,\" she says, due to preexisting safety concerns stemming from her public opposition to Trump's attempt to subvert the American democratic order. But during these first days of her recovery, she remembers a very \"disorienting\" feeling of also not knowing why the men with guns, guarding her hospital room, were operating the way that they were.It wasn't until that Sunday, Griswold says, that she got a straight answer.When she, her husband, and the new addition to their family arrived back at their home that evening, Griswold was drained and exhausted -- but she \"visually could see again that the security was increased at my residence, and at that point, I called and demanded to know what  going on,\" the Colorado election official explains.It was only then that Griswold was told that her security detail had been expanded because, \"as I was being wheeled in to have this baby,\" state and federal law enforcement officials were preparing to arrest a 45-year-old Colorado man, Teak Brockbank, for making violent threats against her and others. \"I was a brand new mom and elsewhere in the state, this guy was being taken into custody for threatening to take my life.\"On August 26, the Attorney General Merrick Garland announced that Brockbank, an apparent Trump devotee, had been taken into custody and charged with making \"detailed death threats against election officials, judges, and law enforcement officers.\" Garland continued: \"Violent threats against public servants are a danger to our democracy, and the arrest and charges announced today make clear that the Justice Department will see to it that perpetrators answer for their actions.\"The initial DOJ announcement about the case -- part of the department's broader Election Threats Task Force, established during President Joe Biden's first year in office -- did not mention Griswold by name. But her office had flagged his alleged online activity to law enforcement years ago, with his name being just one of a deluge of violent or credible threats made against her during Trump's post-presidency.According to documents her office shared with Rolling Stone, Brockbank allegedly wrote several messages specifically calling for Griswold's execution, along with other Democratic officials, donors, and perceived allies. \"Once these people start getting put to death then the rest will melt like snowflakes and turn on each other, and we will just sit back  the worst of them get pointed out and we put them against the wall as well,\" read one post, which added: \"So those of us that have the stomach for what has to be done should prepare our minds for what we all are going to do!\"\"People like the secretary of state of Colorado  the secretary  state of Arizona have to be put to death,\" he allegedly wrote in a separate post, adding that \"the only answer is for us to start executing these puppets ... Death penalty is what these people have to get.\"The FBI claims Brockbank, a convicted felon, illegally possessed guns. The Justice Department alleges that Brockbank made serious violent threats in 2021 and 2022, and that at the end of last year, following the Colorado Supreme Court ruling that Trump could be kept off the state's 2024 primary ballot (a decision the U.S. Supreme Court later nullified), he wrote in a private message: \"Four judges in Colorado have removed President Trump from the ballot in Colorado. their names have been added to my list... their names have been moved to the front of my list.\"According to the government's criminal complaint against Brockbank, in late May of this year, a judge \"issued a second search warrant for Brockbank's Apple iCloud account. Communications in the account reflected Brockbank's continued interest in violence toward public officials as well as his ongoing and recent illegal possession of firearms.\"But by the time the 2024 election season had arrived, threats of this nature had become a common occupational hazard not just for Griswold, but scores of public officials and election workers across the nation -- with numerous such threats explicitly fueled and inspired by Trump's rhetoric and anti-democratic lies about the 2020 election being \"stolen\" from him.The top Colorado election official explains how the ongoing salvos of threats and harassment have affected how she and her family conduct their daily lives. There are moments when her husband rethinks going on a jog outdoors. The family closes their blinds more often than they otherwise would. And an unknown vehicle passing and then briefly lingering on their street doesn't feel the same as it would have several years ago.She describes her daily security protocols and requirements as, without a doubt, the \"most challenging thing\" she's dealt with in her time as secretary of state. But she says finding joy with her family and continuing to go about her life and work \"become the resistance to this threat atmosphere.\"Trump, who has been the target of two high-profile assassination attempts this year, has a long history of encouraging, whipping up, and celebrating political violence. On numerous occasions, when the former president has been publicly or privately asked to condemn the political violence and the waves of threats carried out by his most radicalized followers, he has declined to do so.In March, Rolling Stone reported on how Griswold alone had experienced a 600 percent uptick in these kinds of serious threats, ever since she backed the unsuccessful effort in her blue state to dump the twice-impeached former president from its ballot, citing his attempt to overturn the 2020 election results and cling to power.It is common for law enforcement to surge or enhance existing security details based on the perceived increase in the threat level to a protectee; that can at times include situations surrounding the arrest of somebody who made credible violent threats against a protected public figure. Sometimes these enhancements are done even if out of an abundance of caution.\"We work in regular partnership with the Secretary of State's Office and are aware of numerous messages received by her and her office. As per standard process, for the safety of those involved, we will not discuss the security arrangements of any individual,\" Sergeant Patrick Rice of the Colorado State Patrol emailed in a statement on Friday.Prominent election officials working in multiple states -- including in critical battlegrounds that will determine who is inaugurated in Washington, D.C., in January -- have been raising alarms about the unique threat environment ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump are competing in a stubbornly close race (according to various high-quality public and internal polls) that has all the potential to explode into a brutal post-election legal onslaught.Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes (D), the top election official in that key battleground state, told Rolling Stone in January that the Biden Justice Department was failing to protect election workers from what he dubbed \"domestic terrorism\" and threats by pro-Trump extremists and others.\"As cautious a person as Attorney General Merrick Garland is, I think he is being far too cautious here, when it comes to these investigations and prosecutions of threats against election administrators and election workers,\" Fontes said. \"I have a lot of respect for the attorney general, but he is not being nearly aggressive enough on this threat, which is imperiling our democracy, and he and the department are not devoting nearly enough resources to it. This should be treated like the emergency that it is.\"As for Colorado's secretary of state, Griswold consistently reminds the voters of her state that she refuses to be \"intimidated,\" despite a regular influx of gruesome-sounding phone calls, social media posts, and other messages. Since September 2023, she says she has received more than 1,000 death threats or violent threats. Election Day 2024 is now weeks away.\"It's honestly infuriating that this is the atmosphere that Donald Trump has created for women in office and election officials across the country,\" Griswold says. \"Of course, not everybody is going through this experience of heightened threats while you're giving birth, but it just permeates your life in such a real way that even in the most intimate moments, you may not be able to escape it... The MAGA threat environment follows us through every step of life.\"She continues: \"The bitter irony  that Trump and MAGA Republicans continue to say they care about families and life, but I can tell you as a new mom and election official, they don't support either of those identities ... Folks who are trying to intimidate election officials out of our jobs,  cannot win. We cannot give up ... You cannot allow Trump and the far right to take control of your life.\"",

    "content": "It's just past 4am.Daniel Aula is in his one room apartment praying, thankful he's alive, and thankful he's heading to work.Aula, originally from Haiti, has been living in Springfield over a year now. He knew about the quiet Ohio city through a friend and heard it had not only a low cost of living but also great work opportunities to match.Why not?It's a world better than what he was running from. Aula had been a police officer back in crime-wracked Haiti, until he wasn't. His house was burned down, he went into hiding, and was told people were coming to kill him.\"I know that. There are two friends who let me know that,\" he told CNN.\"My life was not safe,\" he told CNN. \"I decide to leave Haiti.\"While Aula has found opportunity in Springfield, he's also found himself in the middle of a bitter national debate on immigration heading into November's election, fueled in this case largely by rumors and threats.The city of Springfield estimates there are between 12,000 and 15,000 immigrants living in Clark County, the county that holds Springfield, most of them believed to be Haitians arriving in just the past four years.The image of a city dramatically altered by immigration has been seized upon by former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance -- who have made criticism of the Biden administration's immigration policy a cornerstone of their campaign.Trump falsely told about 67 million viewers that Haitians in Springfield were \"eating the dogs\" and \"eating the cats,\" during the presidential debate on September 10.And Vance has made repeated false claims about Haitians, fueling rumors that they kill pets and do not have legal status in the country.Trump is already threatening to deport Springfield's Haitian residents if elected.\"You have to remove the people, and you have to bring them back to their own country,\" he told News Nation in an early October interview.Video Ad FeedbackHe was a police officer in Haiti. Everything changed when he was told people were coming to kill him01:08 - Source: CNNA shot at a new lifeSpringfield is Aula's chance at a new life. He's taking English classes, but he's had so much to learn, namely how to get a job. Many in Springfield have been eager to help him, and to hire him.Not long after he got to Springfield, Aula started working at Pentaflex, a company focused mainly on building metal stampings and assemblies for safety related functions like the brakes on a truck.CEO Ross McGregor, whose family has been involved in manufacturing here for decades, has nothing but praise for his Haitian employees. To lose them would be a blow to his business, he told CNN. McGregor hired his first Haitian worker \"three, four years ago\" not because he sought them out specifically but because he needed dependable workers.\"Retail demand was climbing through the roof,\" McGregor told CNN. \"We were having a real hard time with people that would apply for a job and then they wouldn't show up on the floor.\"\"Or they'd come in and they'd work for half a day and they'd just leave,\" he said. \"That is, you know, a real problem when you're running a production facility. You need to have a reliable workforce that you can count on to be at work every day.\"In contrast, his Haitian employees seem eager to work, he says. He walked CNN through his factory, pointing out work instructions available both in English and Haitian Creole.\"I want to dispel one thing,\" he told CNN unprompted: \"We don't bring (Haitian workers) in at a substandard wage and work them and pay them any less than we would any other employee,\" he said. \"There are no Haitians that are taking anybody's jobs. I mean, if you want a job, you can get a job. And I just encourage people to have a little bit of empathy for where the Haitians are coming from.\"\"I don't know a person in this town that wouldn't want to get the hell out of (Haiti),\" he said.The rapid arrival of Haitians in Springfield has created both growing opportunities and pains. Some would come with any population increase; some have been specific to the culture differences and language barriers.Multiple city and state officials point to the population influx of Haitians as a major boost to Springfield's economy.Over the last several years, \"We've seen more growth than we've seen for decades past,\" said Springfield City Manager Bryan Heck, including a \"revitalization and resurgence of our downtown.\"The growing pains, however, were maybe encapsulated best by Springfield Mayor Rob Rue during a July 2024 City Commission meeting where he told a resident, \"We were not in control of this.\"Video Ad Feedback'It boggles my mind:' CEO reacts to Springfield Haitians getting 'free ride'00:59 - Source: CNN\"We didn't get a chance to have an infrastructure in place if there are going to be 20,000 more people from '20 to '25 -- we didn't get to do that. So, the most frustrating thing is we've got to spend tax dollars that were already in a flat budget, that we've got to vote on to try to take care of 15,000 more folks that are here and make sure that everybody has a safe environment to be in,\" he said.Springfield's growing population has put pressure on services like health care, including wait times for things like blood pressure screenings, vaccinations and more. Visits requiring interpreters also take longer, making lines stretch even further. It's part of why the state of Ohio helped open a mobile healthcare clinic, to try and ease some of those pressure points. State officials say they saw close to 100 patients in about a week's time, which exceeded expectations.\"The system's been strained for a couple of years, we just now have people paying more attention,\" said Chris Cook, health commissioner for Clark County, which includes Springfield.Maternal health care has been an especially poignant issue because of \"poor prenatal care\" in Haiti, he said. \"You've got moms who are walking in the hospital that are in labor. They're ready to give birth in probably the next couple hours, and they've never had a single prenatal visit,\" Cook told CNN.Cook said they also encourage new mothers to be part of their Women Infants and Children (WIC) supplemental nutrition program and hope to have appointments within 10 days of the baby's birth. But over time, waits grew to two months, he said.\"That's not just our Haitian moms,\" Cook said. \"Everybody's in the same line.\"Another major area of concern in Springfield has been housing, with signs of stress dating all the way back to 2018 in regard to availability and cost -- years before Haitians began arriving after the Biden administration approved Temporary Protective Status in 2021 due to the violence, human rights abuses, and dire economic situation in Haiti.City Manager Bryan Heck sent a letter to Sens. Sherrod of Ohio Brown and Tim Scott of South Carolina -- then cc'd Vance in July of 2024 -- regarding \"a significant strain,\" regarding housing.\"I didn't call it a migrant crisis. I didn't call it an immigration crisis. It's a housing crisis,\" Heck told CNN. \"The pace of growth for our community is just -- was not sustainable and continues to not be sustainable unless we get some additional support from the state and federal government,\" Heck said.Rent also went up, partly from the increased demand of a new population but driven also by the \"greed of landlords,\" as Mayor Rue put it during a July City Commission meeting. Prices were also likely affected by nationwide inflation in recent years.Springfield, Ohio Mayor Rob Rue speaks to residents during a town hall about the 2024 presidential election's focus on the town's influx of Haitian immigrants, on September 24, 2024.Dominic Gwinn/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty Images/FileSpringfield, Ohio commissioner Bryan Heck speaks to residents during a town hall about the 2024 presidential election's focus on the town's influx of Haitian immigrants, on September 24, 2024.Dominic Gwinn/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty Images/FileHaitian immigrant and US Navy veteran Jaob Payen listens neighbors in Springfield, Ohio deride Haitian immigrants during a town hall about the 2024 presidential election's focus on the town's influx of Haitian immigrants, on September 24, 2024.Dominic Gwinn/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty Images/FileWhile Trump has claimed the influx brought \"dangerous\" criminality, Clark County Prosecuting Attorney Daniel Driscoll, a Republican, told CNN last month that was not the case.\"During the time that I've been with the prosecutor's office, which is 21 years now, we have not had any murders involving the Haitian community -- as either the victims or as the perpetrators of those murders.\" He confirmed to CNN this week this was still the case.Overall, according to the City of Springfield, \"Haitians are more likely to be the victims of crime than they are to be the perpetrators in our community.

So, what we want to do is we want to get driver's education to that population.\"It's an issue that state officials have found hard to immediately tackle, given that adults in Ohio can test for a driver's license and receive it without having to go through a formal training program.Governor Mike DeWine recently directed the Ohio State Highway Patrol to support Springfield Police with traffic enforcement \"to address the increase in dangerous driving in Springfield by inexperienced Haitian drivers and all others who disregard traffic laws.\"While some Springfieldians gripe about the effects of immigration, others are stepping up.

Hundreds of thousands of Haitians have been forced to flee their homes after gang attacks.Given Haiti's anarchial unrest in recent years, Haitians were added to a Biden-Harris administration parole program, limited to only a few countries, that allows vetted participants to enter the United States as long as they are sponsored by US residents.Others have Temporary Protected Status (TPS), a renewable program that shields some at-risk nationalities from deportation and allows them to live and work in the country for a limited period of time.Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas designated Haitians for Temporary Protected Status starting in 2021 and has subsequently extended and redesignated Haiti through February 2026.Those in the United States under the parole program are able to apply for TPS.Video Ad FeedbackHaitian man shares why Trump's rhetoric has scared him01:10 - Source: CNN\"We frequently see people who have just entered within the past month or two,\" said Katie Kersh, a senior attorney at Advocates for Basic Legal Equality (ABLE), where she specializes in immigration and civil rights and has represented Haitians for years.She and her team have been working to provide free legal clinics assisting Haitians in Springfield and beyond who have arrived in the past two years assisting them with applications for TPS, asylum, work permits and more.Kersh said Haitians do hear Trump's comments about deportations, and even she \"can't tell anyone that there's no likelihood that there could be some sort of mass enforcement action.\"However, a broader revocation of previously granted parole or TPS would \"be definitely challenged in the courts and probably successfully. So that's a big thing that we're trying to tell people, that it would be really, really procedurally and legally difficult for that to happen,\" Kersh said.Still, many Haitian residents in Springfield live in fear of Trump's threat of removal, unsure over their future and their safety.Dieff-Son Lebon is one of those Haitians. CNN met Lebon as he got off work at a construction site before heading to dinner at one of the multiple Haitian restaurants that have opened in Springfield.But first, he made a stop with an immigration advocate to consider his options if there was any mass deportation effort that included him. He's been a little more nervous than usual lately.\"As I was walking down the road, a white man drove by and yelled Trump!\" Lebon said in Creole. Lebon took it as a threat.\"I was scared! Because I was on the street, I was going to buy something, and I was also walking on foot, so I was scared, and I hurried to get home,\" he told CNN.He said he had never dealt with anything like that since living in Springfield.\"It was peaceful here, understand, there were no such things. Everything started after the remark,\" he said.The \"remark\" in question came during the presidential debate in early September, but it all likely stemmed from August 28, 2024.A Springfield resident reported to police that she suspected her Haitian neighbors of chopping up her cat after finding \"meat\" in the backyard.Soon after, social media posts began circulating about pet-eating Haitians and were even promoted by neo-Nazi groups, some of which have shown up to Springfield in person marching against Haitians being there.Just days after the initial police report, the owner's cat \"Miss Sassy\" was found safe in her basement. While the literal cat was found, the metaphorical cat was out of the bag, and the claims spread far and fast, eventually making its way onto the debate stage.First Vance's team picked up the rumors, with the senator claiming, \"You have a lot of people saying 'my pets are being abducted'\" and \"'slaughtered right in front of us.'\"And then Trump made the claim at the debate.The claims have been refuted by Springfield officials and City Manager Bryan Heck told CNN that Vance's team knew there was no substantiated evidence.Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance speaks to a crowd in Leesport, Pennsylvania, on September 21, 2024. Throughout the rally Vance repeated claims regarding Hatian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio.Matthew Hatcher/Getty Images\"I had a call from one of Vance's staffers and asked, 'Hey, are the rumors true of pets being taken and eaten by the immigrants in your community?' I said no,\" Heck told CNN. \"It's a baseless claim,\" he added.\"To see that continue to be retweeted by Vance himself the next day and then sitting there watching the presidential debate\" was \"difficult,\" Heck said.Days after the presidential debate, city buildings and schools were hit with multiple threats of violence, prompting evacuations and cancellations of events. While state officials later said these threats ended up being hoaxes, many \"from overseas,\" they still prompted real evacuations and warranted a beefing up of security both for city officials and schools.\"To have threats thrown at my family and thrown at my house to explain to my 12-year-old why a bomb dog has to sniff our house to see if something is explosive there. That's tough,\" Heck told CNN.Gov. DeWine's 'obligation to tell the truth'Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine was born in Springfield, Ohio. While he grew up in a town nearby, he took his now-wife, Ohio first lady Fran DeWine, on dates to Springfield when they were both in high school.The DeWines fund a school in the dangerous Cité Soleil, an impoverished neighborhood in Haitian capital Port-au-Prince -- an area entirely under gang control, where thousands of civilians live as a captive population.DeWine is also a Trump-supporting Republican. All those aspects of his life have collided this past month in a way he simply described as \"kind of strange.\"\"As governor, I have an obligation to tell the truth and talk about Springfield,\" DeWine told CNN.While DeWine readily acknowledges not everything has been perfect as the Haitian population has grown, he also said it's unmistakable that \"if you look at Springfield's growth in the last few years, that's been fueled, a lot of it by the Haitian immigrants who were taking jobs that were open.\"Video Ad FeedbackOhio Governor on why he plans to vote for Trump in 2024 election01:05 - Source: CNNHe even said he had one employer \"look me in the eye\" and tell him, \"'I don't think our company really would be here today if it wasn't for Haitians.'\"Historically, Haitians are hardly the only group to immigrate to Springfield. For starters, \"The Gammon House\" in Springfield was a stop on the Underground Railroad, serving as a symbol of a step toward freedom and a new life for the freed slaves in America. Some of the first Greek establishments opened in Springfield in the early 1900s, but the area also saw an influx of Germans, Irish, and later on Hispanics.In 1970 the population in Springfield was around 82,000. The 2020 federal census showed a drop to around 58,000.\"Pumping resources into the community is how communities grow. This is how we grow,\" DeWine told CNN.While Trump's deportation threat may not be easily carried out, DeWine believes removing Haitians from Springfield would not be good for the city.\"It would be a mistake to kick these people out who are working, who are raising their family, who are productive members of society. I think that's an economic mistake. I think it's a moral mistake as well,\" DeWine told CNN.But not enough of a mistake to change his vote.\"I support my party,\" he said. \"Going against the nominee of the party, I think makes me a less effective governor of the state of Ohio.\"\"I think the decision to who you support for president is based upon multiple issues,\" he said.And, he said, he is supporting the Haitian community.\"I make my position very, very clear. I don't think they should be thrown out. I think it would be a dramatic mistake. I think it's wrong,\" he told CNN.Daniel Aula's fate may hang on how America votes on November 5. But he is sanguine about the heated rhetoric around his community's presence in town -- and still, despite everything, grateful to be here.\"The world, it's like a village,\" Aula said. \"Like a village, angry people and happy people have to live together.\"\"Immigrants cannot take the place of people, American citizens,\" he told CNN while driving through Springfield. \"They just come to collaborate.\"\"Even the people (who are) angry about me, I love all of them,\" Aula said. \"I love all of them, even the people that hate me.\"Reporting contributed by CNN's Catherine E.

    "title": "Researcher says the Church is 'secret weapon' to winning 2024 presidential election",
    "content": "A Christian researcher is warning that churches are not doing enough to ensure that faith-based voters make their voices heard in the 2024 presidential election, pointing to the impact of Evangelicals not voting in the 2020 election had on the outcome.Craig Huey, a researcher with a marketing background who has written books including The Christian Voter: How to Vote For, Not Against, Your Values to Transform Culture and Politics, shared data about the number of Evangelicals who did not vote in the six swing states in the 2020 presidential election. The six major swing states in both the 2020 and 2024 presidential elections are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.Worth a combined 87 votes in the Electoral College, the candidate who wins most or all of them will emerge victorious in the 2024 election. Polling of the battleground states shows a close race between Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and former President and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.Overall, Huey found that about 6.9 million Evangelical voters residing in the swing states did not vote in the 2020 presidential election. Huey's data finds that the number of Evangelicals who did not vote exceeded President Joe Biden's margin of victory in five of the six swing states he won in 2020. Determining that 84% of them would have voted for Trump, Huey's research reveals that they would have swung the outcome of the election had they voted.In the 2020 presidential election, Biden won Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Victories in those states helped him secure 306 electoral votes to Trump's 232, thereby exceeding the 270 electoral votes required to clinch the presidency.Data shared with The Christian Post showed that in Arizona, 730,624 Evangelicals did not vote in the 2020 presidential election. Biden won the state by 10,457 votes. Arizona has 11 electoral votes.In Georgia, Huey found that 1,349,454 Evangelicals did not vote. Biden carried the state, which has 16 electoral votes, by 11,779 votes.In Michigan, which had 16 electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election but now only has 15 due to reapportionment following the 2020 United States Census, 1,338,126 Evangelicals did not vote. Biden won the state by 154,188 votes.In Pennsylvania, which had 20 electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election but now only has 19 following reapportionment, 1,494,611 Evangelicals did not vote. Biden carried the state by a margin of 80,555 votes.In Wisconsin, which has 10 electoral votes, 873,854 Evangelicals abstained from the 2020 election. Biden won the state by 20,682 votes.Even in North Carolina, the one swing state that Trump won in 2016, Evangelicals not voting could make the difference in 2024. Trump only carried the state, which now has 16 electoral college votes but had just 15 in 2020, by around 74,500 votes. Huey measured the number of Evangelicals living in the state who did not vote at 1,195,729.In an interview with The Christian Post, Huey said that \"as we take a look at the Pew Research, for example, we're able to find out how many evangelicals are in all 50 states.\"\"And so we took the number of Evangelicals that were in those six swing states to see how many Evangelicals there are and there's a number of exit polls after every election that CNN and  and different groups do,\" he said.After looking at the number of \"self-proclaimed white Evangelicals\" and comparing that data to \"the number of Evangelicals within the state,\" Huey found \"6.9 million born again Evangelical Christians who proclaimed Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior\" and believe \"that he died on the cross and rose from the dead\" who did not vote in 2020. He shared his view that whether or not the large number of Evangelicals who sat out in 2020 do so again in 2024 depends on the actions taken by American pastors leading up to the election.Huey told CP that it is \"the church that holds the answer to this upcoming election,\" suggesting that pastors have an obligation to ensure that their congregation is actively engaged and prepared to vote.\"It's the church that is the secret weapon to winning the election and yet, the pastors are quiet. Very few Evangelicals are doing what's necessary to mobilize the church to vote for, not against their values,\" Huey said.Huey pointed to the Evangelical vote as the decisive factor that enabled Trump to win the 2016 election while causing him to lose in 2020.\"There were more Evangelicals that turned out in 2016,\" he explained. \"It was by maybe 4-5% less Evangelicals voted but that's millions. And that was significant enough in those swing states to have made the difference.\"\"Part of it was because the Evangelicals in 2016 recognized Trump had a broken, flawed personality,\" he said. \"They recognized that there was a disconnect between who he was and what his policy was but he was one who held promise for turning things around.\"According to Huey, \"Evangelical pastors, the nonprofit groups, the megachurches, they got behind Trump, they told their congregations they had to get out and vote. They did massive door-to-door in Wisconsin, in some of the swing states in 2016. That did not happen in 2020.\"\"So when the Republican candidate doesn't have the Evangelical support, that's a significant amount of vote that can sway the election one way or the other,\" he added.Huey expressed concern that several Evangelical pastors were not properly informing their congregations about the upcoming election, or saying that \"there was an election but it doesn't really matter who you vote for\" and that \"what matters is that you stand for Jesus Christ.\"Huey cited these actions as \"completely suppressing the whole voting bloc within that church.\" When asked why he thinks a large number of Evangelicals do not vote, Huey brought the conversation back to the role of church leaders, saying that \"the pastors are so silent.\"Huey contended that some pastors remain silent because of fear of facing retaliation under the Johnson Amendment, which makes churches refraining from explicitly endorsing a candidate a condition for tax-exempt status. He also pointed to concerns about angering a proportion of the congregation with political views in opposition to those of the pastor as another possible reason.The researcher also detailed how churches have played an active role in American history, citing as examples the American Revolution and the abolitionist movement.\"Who were the ones who spoke up that helped spark the American Revolution? It was the pastors and they mobilized the churches,\" he said.\"Who was it that spoke up against slavery? It was the Evangelical pastors and they mobilized their church to help make a change with slavery. The church should be the conscience of the community and it has abandoned that role.\"Huey described how he was \"very concerned\" about Evangelical turnout in 2024, lamenting that he does not see \"any effort to mobilize\" Christian voters on behalf of pastors.\"I think the amount of effort reaching Evangelicals is sadly lacking,\" he stated. \"There's a lot of people talking and bragging about what they want to do and what they plan to do but in actuality, they're not able to get either the resources or the organization to be able to do it. And so it's disturbing that we're not further along than we are.\"\"Every church should be registering voters,\" he concluded. \"But very few churches have any voter registration effort. And quite frankly, every pastor should say, 'raise your hands if you're not registered to vote.' And then pass out the voter registration and say, 'Here, fill this out. We'll take it in.' Every pastor should make sure there's a table set up in the foyer letting people register but they're not.\"Voter registration and outreach efforts have emerged at some churches in past elections, most notably at Calvary Chapel Chino Hills, a megachurch located in Southern California. Last year, the church held a workshop encouraging other churches to follow in its footsteps. It contained information about how churches can engage in ballot collecting for churches as well as voter registration laws and \"legal do's and don'ts for churches.\"",

Most business executives expect Harris to broadly continue President Joe Biden's policies, including his war on so-called junk fees across industries.Personnel is policy, as the saying goes, so the ramifications of the presidential race won't become clear until the winner begins appointments for as many as a dozen key bodies, including the Treasury, Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission, and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.CNBC examined the stakes of the 2024 presidential election for some of corporate America's biggest sectors.

    "title": "What Republican Duke Buckner's steep climb in SC congressional race says about power of Jim Clyburn",
    "content": "WALTERBORO -- In a state where Republicans typically enjoy a smooth path to victory, Duke Buckner faces the rare uphill climb.While his GOP counterparts here glide toward November, the 52-year-old attorney is locked in a difficult race against U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn, a titan in national Democratic politics and one of South Carolina's most entrenched incumbents.The lopsided battle is playing out in the 6th Congressional District, one of the last Democratic bastions in deep-red South Carolina, stretching from The Battery in downtown Charleston to Columbia and then spreading across a bevy of rural towns and suburban pockets.Here, voters haven't sent a Republican to Congress since 1984, and the electorate has been electing -- and reelecting -- Clyburn to represent their interests in Washington for over three decades.After losing to Clyburn by a wide margin in 2022, Buckner is back for a rematch hoping to capitalize on economic anxieties and frustrations with the status quo.\"He's 84 years old, and he's been in Congress for 32 years,\" Buckner said of Clyburn. \"When you look around the district and ask yourself 'Has he done his job for this area?' -- the facts speak for themselves,\" he added, pointing to the district's persistent poverty.\"If you want to see real change,\" Buckner continued, \"it's time to vote for the person and not the party.\"But one person Buckner is not talking much about is Republican leader Donald Trump, the former president who is competing against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 battle for the White House.Trump's name appears nowhere on Buckner's campaign website or Facebook page. The closest the two appear together is on separate signs displayed in adjacent windows of the Clarendon County GOP offices in downtown Manning.Trump has not endorsed Buckner's congressional bid; Buckner would not say whether he voted for Trump in the 2024 Republican presidential primary.Palmetto Politics Who are the 2 Republicans vying to unseat Jim Clyburn? By Eva Herscowitz eherscowitz@postandcourier.com\"That's a private matter. It's nobody's business who I vote for,\" Buckner said, reiterating that he supports Trump as the Republican presidential nominee and looked forward to working with whoever Americans elect as president in November.Still, unseating Clyburn will require more than capitalizing on national frustrations on issues like inflation and immigration. It would take a seismic shift, especially among Black voters in the district who make up a core part of Clyburn's enduring support.The S.C. Republican Party is supportive of Buckner's efforts, no matter how challenging his odds, and donated $2,000 to his campaign in September.\"Running against an incumbent is always tough, but that's exactly why Duke Buckner is fit for the job,\" said Drew McKissick, the state GOP chairman. \"His platform addresses the district's dire need for economic growth and his showing against Clyburn in 2022 marks the best by a Republican to date.\"Clyburn said that if people want change, he hasn't heard it. No Democrat challenged Clyburn in the June party primary, while Buckner had to compete against another Republican for the GOP nomination.\"I don't have a message for him,\" Clyburn said when asked about his opponent's charge for change. \"I talk to constituents all the time. I have not had one single constituent say anything other to me other than 'Please don't leave here.'\"Part of the challenge Buckner faces is the map itself.Palmetto Politics Supreme Court upholds Nancy Mace's congressional district that 'exiled' 30,000 Black voters By Caitlin Byrd cbyrd@postandcourier.comFor years, the district encompassed rural counties in the state's Black belt, plus many majority-Black precincts around Columbia and Charleston. The sprawling district stretches across 14 counties, a behemoth political landmass with a geographic footprint larger than the entire state of Hawaii and its islands.Flanked by red on all sides, the district lines changed in January 2022 -- when the Republican-controlled state Legislature passed a map drastically altering the composition of Congressional Districts 1 and 6.The South Carolina NAACP filed a lawsuit contending the newly drawn lines were racially gerrymandered, and the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed. The U.S. Supreme Court disagreed, and upheld the lines as constitutional on May 23.The redrawn maps siphoned 30,000 Black voters from the 1st District to the 6th. That configuration is most consequential for the newly U-shaped coastal District 1, because it concentrates Republican voters in an area currently represented by U.S. Rep.

Here's why. With NIL, the transfer portal and collectives, The Citadel athletics department is at a crossroadsIn the interview, Clyburn pushed back against a May 2023 ProPublica article that claimed he sought to cement his own political power at a cost to Black voters during the congressional map-drawing process.\"I don't care how you draw the lines, I would be running for reelection no matter how you draw the lines,\" Clyburn said. \"Yes, my staffer went to those meetings to observe and reported to me on what he understood they were doing. That's not drawing a line. I didn't draw one darn line at all.\"The 6th remains the only majority-minority congressional district in the Palmetto State.Clyburn is also running on his connection to the Biden administration as a victory for South Carolina, arguing he has the power to make things happen in a bipartisan fashion for the entire state. He said his record shows he has worked well with Republicans, including Gov. Henry McMaster and U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.Clyburn is widely credited with being the man who helped deliver the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination for Joe Biden with a pivotal endorsement four years ago. Now he is working to boost Harris in the final push for the White House.Palmetto Politics SC's Jim Clyburn on DNC stage: Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris is among his best decisions By Caitlin Byrd cbyrd@postandcourier.comHe pointed to how he helped the state secure a $175 million federal grant for a new bridge for Interstate 95 over Lake Marion as an example, and noted it will also include a 24-inch pipe attached to the bridge that will bring drinking water into Clarendon County.And, Clyburn posits, if Vice President Kamala Harris wins the 2024 presidential election, South Carolina is going to need a powerful Democrat like him.\"We cannot afford to lose the one liaison we have with this administration,\" Clyburn said.\"We need to work together in a bipartisan way. There's no question,\" he said. \"And it's no secret that I've got a very close relationship with this administration, and I've decided to use that relationship to the benefit of South Carolinians -- and I think I've succeeded at that.\"Buckner disagrees, and points to the fact that the 6th District is the poorest congressional district in the state.Democratic Rep. Clyburn's role in redrawn Congressional maps becomes key in Supreme Court redistricting case By Marilyn W. Thompson PropublicaAmong his ideas to help are cutting the corporate tax rates to 20 percent for businesses but only if they use that saved money to hire a certain number of workers, as well as eliminating the federal Department of Education.Buckner is also testing the limits of a relatively new political strategy for Republicans in a post-Roe America: Pledging to vote against any abortion legislation in Congress because \"it's up to the states to decide,\" he said.Buckner said he is opposed to any legislation that would impose additional restrictions on firearms.That includes \"red flag\" laws to take guns away from people believed to be dangers to themselves or others, and efforts to close the so-called Charleston loophole that allowed Dylann Roof to purchase the gun used to kill nine Black parishioners in the 2015 Emanuel AME Church murders.While Roof had an arrest record for drug use -- a prohibiting factor that should have barred him from buying a firearm -- he was able to purchase a .45-caliber Glock when his FBI background check was not completed within the three-day deadline.The crack in the law would come to be known as the \"Charleston loophole.\"Since the 2015 shooting, Clyburn has repeatedly pushed for legislation that would give law enforcement 10 days to complete a background check before a gun can be purchased -- instead of the current three days.Over the past two years, Buckner has raised nearly $182,000 in his second bid to defeat Clyburn. It's a drop in the bucket compared the $1.9 million Clyburn reported having in his campaign account as of June 30.Buckner admitted the race will be difficult.It's why, he confirmed, there is a Bible verse -- Genesis 26:22 -- that appears on his campaign website.The passage is the triumphant end to the Biblical story of how God commanded one of his followers, Isaac, to stay on the land during a drought and dig another well even after his two previous efforts had failed.Election Day is Nov. 5.",

I think that at this rate, Ghanaians themselves can assess and see for themselves that His Excellency Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia has shot into the future and left Mahama in the village of history,\" said Nene Ofoe Teye-Chu Agbadiagba IV, who recently retired from the GPHA.Nene Agbadiagba, who was recently given a powerful citation at GPHA, was speaking to journalists in an exclusive interview at the Tema Fishing Harbour when he made the analogy.\"In this day and age, when progressive and forward-looking countries are having conversations about using PoultryApp and even AI for agriculture, Mr. John Mahama is thinking about packing chicken in a polythene bag for farmers,\" Nene Agbadiagba mocked John Mahama with a smile.On Monday, October 7, 2024, Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia, who is also the Flagbearer of the New Patriotic Party, launched the CitizenApp in Accra.\nDr. Bawumia explained that since 2017, the NPP government has remained committed to laying a solid digital foundation, including the introduction of a Biometric National Identity Card (Ghanacard), a digital address system, mobile money interoperability to increase financial inclusion, and the digitization of critical public services.Building these digital foundations is critical to the transition of a contemporary economy during the Fourth Industrial Revolution.The launch of the CitizenApp, he says, \"further demonstrates our commitment to enhancing interactions between government and citizens, as well as giving citizens the best digital experience.\"Responding to the development, Nene Ofoe Teye-Chu Agbadiagba praised Dr. Bawumia for what he described as his \"sense of the future,\" adding that the digital footprints Dr. Bawumia is leaving on Ghana's development are his ticket to a massive victory in the 2024 presidential election.",

    "title": "MIL-OSI Global: 2024 US presidential election: can we believe the polls?",
    "content": "Source: The Conversation - France - By Jérôme Viala-Gaudefroy, Spécialiste de la politique américaine, Auteurs historiques The Conversation FranceNationwide polls are often of limited relevance, considering the unique structure of the US electoral system. To gain a better understanding of the upcoming presidential election, we need to focus on surveys conducted in the pivotal battlegrounds - the so-called swing states. After the missteps in previous elections, it's hard to place too much confidence in these polls, as many rely on unrepresentative samples.As we head toward the 2024 US presidential election, media large and small frequently fall into the trap of \"horse race\" journalism. Policy questions are rarely treated in depth, and the emphasis is often on the latest polls. One week they announce Kamala Harris as moving ahead, and the next, Donald Trump still has an edge. But how reliable are these polls?In the United States, rather than being elected by direct popular vote, the president is chosen indirectly through the Electoral College, an institution inscribed in the country's constitution. Each state is assigned a number of electors based in part on its population, but also on its number of senators. As a result, smaller states get a larger voice than their population would indicate.One of the implications is that national election polls can be deceiving. In most states with established partisan majorities, the outcomes are predictable due to the winner-takes-all approach. This system awards all of a state's electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote in that state (with the exception of Maine and Nebraska, which use a proportional system). As a result, the most relevant polls are those conducted in \"swing states\", where neither party holds a consistent advantage.According to recent analyses, around ten states are expected to be in play for 2024. Based on recent trends, there are seven swing states to watch: Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia. In the 2016 and 2020 elections, victory margins in these states were razor-thin, often less than 1%.With both Harris and Trump within striking distance of the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency, these swing states, with a combined 91 votes, will determine the outcome.When the margins are so tight in these key states, accurately measuring voter intentions is an enormous challenge. In 2016, national polls correctly predicted Hillary Clinton's popular-vote win - she had nearly 3 million more than Trump. However, they failed to foresee Trump's Electorial College victories in critical states, which ultimately put him over the top.The American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) pointed out several reasons for these errors, including underrepresentation of Republican voters, over-representation of college-educated voters (who tend to lean Democratic), and an underestimation of undecided voters who eventually voted for Trump or third-party candidates.Despite efforts to fix these problems, other biases showed up in 2020. While graduate voters were not over-represented and undecideds were evenly split between Biden and Trump, the Covid-19 pandemic had made the pollsters' task more complicated. AAPOR points out that the states with a higher proportion of Covid-19 cases were the ones with the highest polling errors. As a result, pollsters underestimated Trump's vote share in key swing states and also overestimated Biden's national lead, making the 2020 polls the least accurate in 40 years.Despite these errors, Biden still triumphed, winning 4 percent more of the popular vote and taking home 306 electoral votes to Trump's 232. Biden's victories in the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin make all the difference.Errors of this magnitude naturally increase the public's scepticism of polling, especially among Republicans, who are already wary of establishment institutions. Contrary to initial assumptions, Trump voters didn't hesitate to express their preferences in 2016 and 2020. However, they were less likely to participate in polls due in part to their distrust of mainstream institutions. As a result, working-class white voters - and their opinions - were underrepresented in many polls.Pollsters also face technical challenges. Getting a respondent on the phone now requires calling hundreds of people, thanks to caller ID and call screening. Polls with smaller samples (fewer than 1,000 respondents) are less reliable. To deal with these hurdles, many pollsters are now using a mix of methods, including e-mail, online surveys, and robocalls.Though cheaper, online surveys often draw voluntary participants who are compensated, which leads to issues of accuracy and representation. This growing reliance on online polling has contributed to a doubling of polling companies from 2000 to 2022, according to Pew Research Center.The margin of error is a critical component of polling that is often misunderstood by the public and media. It typically falls between 3 and 4 percentage points, but for smaller demographic groups (for example, young people, white men, or Hispanics), it can be even higher. Media headlines, however, frequently imply a candidate is leading, even when the difference is within the margin of error. University of California, Berkeley researchers suggest that to ensure 95% accuracy, the margin of error should be closer to 6%.However, the media sometimes amplify results, particularly in headlines, by implying that a candidate is ahead, even when the difference is within the margin of error. Moreover, researchers at the University of Berkeley have shown that to guarantee 95% accuracy, this margin should be increased to at least 6%. This means a candidate projected to receive 54% of the vote is likely, in reality, to secure anywhere between 48% and 60%, reflecting an actual margin of error of 12 percentage points.Another significant challenge for pollsters is identifying likely voters. Only around two-thirds of citizens eligible to vote actually go to the polls. In 2016, turnout on the Democratic side was overestimated, giving the false impression that Clinton was a lock for victory. This likely caused some of her supporters to stay home, while Trump's base showed up in force when polls suggested he was behind. Accurately predicting who will turn out to vote is crucial to polling accuracy.Polling showed notable improvements during the 2022 midterm elections, with the results being the most accurate since 1998. Importantly, there was no significant bias toward either party. However, midterm elections operate differently than presidential elections, and the dynamics for 2024 may be very different. That said, many polling institutions have adapted since 2016: as of 2022, 61% of polling firms had changed their methods, such as refining sampling techniques and improving question wording. More than a third have changed their methods after 2020.While these changes are positive, challenges remain, especially in predicting turnout and combating low response rates.At the end of the day, election polls offer snapshots - often imprecise - and can only provide general trends. Polling methods vary across firms, introducing biases that make it difficult to compare results.Survey aggregators offer averages that might be more reliable than individual polls, but they still come with a degree of uncertainty. This is true for FiveThirtyEight, the well-known website founded by statistics guru Nate Silver. After ABC took over in 2023, Silver left, taking his forecasting model with him to his new platform, Silver Bulletin, which continues to attract significant media attention.With the unpredictability of polls, political betting markets have become popular as polling alternatives. Platforms like Polymarket, which recently hired Silver, have multiplied rapidly. Some people, like Elon Musk, argue that markets provide better forecasts than traditional polls, though this claim is unproven. There are also concerns that these markets could be manipulated to sway public opinion.While opinion polls aren't the best tools for predicting elections - as this could be one of the closest in recent history - their value lies in gauging public opinion on key issues. However, even in this role, polls can still be biased, often influenced by how questions are phrased.For example, in 2019 USA Today ran the headline \"Poll: Half of Americans say Trump is victim of a 'witch hunt' as trust in Mueller erodes\". This was in reference to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The question asked by the poll was:\"President Trump has called the special counsel's investigation a 'witch hunt' and said he has been investigated more than previous presidents for political reasons. Do you agree?\"The problem with this wording is that it combined two different ideas: whether the investigation was a \"witch hunt\" and whether Trump had been unfairly targeted for political reasons. On top of that, the question lacked neutrality, presenting only his perspective.Naturally, Trump used the result to his advantage, even though other polls from sources such as The Washington Post, CBS News, and NPR-PBS told a different story.To use polling data wisely during this election, it's crucial to recognize these limitations and pay attention to the fine print - details like the sample size, polling date, margin of error, and methodology. Additionally, consider the poll's sponsors, who may only release results that align with their particular agenda.Ultimately, the best way to interpret polling data is with caution, focusing on general trends rather than any single poll. And always remember, election outcomes can be full of surprises.Jérôme Viala-Gaudefroy ne travaille pas, ne conseille pas, ne possède pas de parts, ne reçoit pas de fonds d'une organisation qui pourrait tirer profit de cet article, et n'a déclaré aucune autre affiliation que son organisme de recherche.",

    "title": "Economic discontent, issue divisions add up to tight presidential contest: POLL",
    "content": "Dreary economic attitudes and sharply divergent views on social policies mark the 2024 presidential election, contributing to a tighter contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump: Just 2 percentage points now divide them in a new ABC News/Ipsos poll.Harris has 50% support to Trump's 48% among likely voters in the national survey, with a similar 49-47% result among all registered voters. (Among all adults, regardless of registration status, it's a single-point race, 49-48%, excluding those who wouldn't vote.)The results are slightly closer than Harris' +5 points among likely voters and the general public, and +4 among registered voters, in the last ABC/Ipsos poll in mid-September. A gain for Trump among men -- he's now +8 points among those registered to vote -- is a factor, as is a slip for Harris among independents, often swing voters.See PDF for full results.Beneath the horse race, issues pull in opposite directions. The poll, produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates, with fieldwork by Ipsos, finds that 56% of Americans now favor deporting all undocumented immigrants, up 20 points from eight years ago. That reinforces one of Trump's strongest issues, with a 10-point Trump lead in trust to handle immigration at the southern border.Yet the same share, 56%, side with Harris on abortion, saying the federal government should restore access to what it was before the Supreme Court eliminated the constitutional right to abortion in 2022. Many fewer, 41%, favor Trump's view that each state should decide. It follows that abortion is Harris' best issue in this poll, with a 15-point lead over Trump in trust on it.The economy/the futureThen there's the economy, and related to it, a sharp division on the nation's future. As reported Friday, 44% of Americans say they're not as well off now as they were when Biden took office, tying the most negative number on this question in data since 1986.MORE: Voters question Harris' pitch as agent of change: POLLFurther, while inflation has eased and employment is strong, those gains haven't hit home for most people: 59% say the economy is getting worse, more than twice as many as say it's getting better, 23%. And among registered voters who say the economy's worsening, Trump leads Harris by a sweeping 53 points, 74-21%.Largely informed by economic attitudes, registered voters divide, 51-47%, on whether America's best days are still ahead, or behind it. This in turn relates to candidate choice: Trump, with his message of national decay, leads Harris by 27 points, 61-34%, among those who say the country's best days are behind it. Harris, with her more optimistic messaging, leads Trump by 28 points, 63-35%, among those who think America's best days are ahead.Taken another way, 59% of Trump's supporters say the country's best days are behind it. Among Harris supporters, 67% say the country's best days are still to come.Economy/issuesTrump leads Harris by 8 points overall in trust to handle the economy and 7 points on inflation, consistent results since August that are central to his competitiveness and reflect Harris' challenges breaking free from dissatisfaction with Biden's economic stewardship. (See more on this in Friday's report on Harris' headwinds as an agent of change.)That said, Harris pushes back on another economic benchmark, \"looking out for the middle class.\" A new item in this poll, she leads Trump on it by 5 points, 42-37%. (The rest don't trust either of them to handle it.)A test of three economic proposals from each candidate fills out the story: Trump has both the most popular and the least popular proposals, with Harris winning the second, third and fourth slots of the six.Specifically, Trump's suggestion to end income taxes on Social Security benefits leads in popularity, followed by three from Harris -- a tax credit for middle- and lower-income families with newborns, a limit on the profits food companies can make on groceries and grants to first-time home buyers. Two more Trump proposals come next -- raising tariffs on foreign imports, and the one that is unpopular among most people, cutting corporate income taxes.One of these -- the idea to end taxes on Social Security benefits -- rises to the level of majority \"strong\" support, 55%. Harris' three proposals also get more strong support than strong opposition, by 10 to 23 points. Trump's remaining items, by contrast, get much less strong support -- and cutting corporate income taxes is more apt to be strongly opposed.In trust on other issues, Trump holds single-digit leads on handling crime and safety, national security and the conflict in the Middle East; Harris has a single-digit lead on \"protecting American democracy.\" Results for items repeated from past polls are virtually unchanged.Enthusiasm and attributesWhile potential voters are closely divided on many points, enthusiasm and personal favorability are two areas in which Harris has clear advantages. Among registered voters who support her, 84% say they're enthusiastic about it; among Trump supporters, enthusiasm drops by 6 points, to 78%. That's markedly lower than enthusiasm for Trump -- 93% -- at this point in 2020.Enthusiasm is related to personal favorability, and 44% of Americans see Harris favorably, vs. 35% for Trump. Harris' favorability rating lost 3 points in this poll, and 47% now see her unfavorably. That said, many more, 58%, have an unfavorable opinion of Trump.Favorability isn't determinative. Trump has been underwater in favorability consistently since 2015 -- but won the Electoral College eight years ago regardless.One important boost to Trump is that, among the 15% of registered voters who see both candidates unfavorably, he leads by a wide margin, 62-24%. Looking at it another way, 21% of Trump's supporters see him unfavorably, but support him anyway. The corresponding figure for Harris is just 7%.MORE: Video How does a VP debate affect candidate favorability? | 538 Politics PodcastTrump also continues to score a few points by portraying Harris as too liberal. Forty-eight percent of Americans see her this way, vs. 43% who call Trump too conservative. That said, 7% call Harris too conservative and 9% call Trump too liberal; at the end of the day, very similar numbers call them \"about right\" ideologically, 43% for Trump, 41% for Harris.Debate?However much they're liked or disliked, another result shows that most people are ready to hear \nMORE: Key takeaways from Harris-Trump ABC News debateTrump reiterated last week that another debate is not in the cards. And there's a difference on the question between their supporters. Among registered voters who prefer Harris, 71% are looking for another debate, while among those who prefer Trump, this drops sharply, to 45%. (After their sole debate last month, 58% overall thought Harris had won it.)PartisansWith the election close to three weeks away, partisanship infuses survey results. Eighty-five percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say the economy is getting worse, for instance, while just 32% of Democrats and Democratic leaners agree. In another example, Republicans and GOP leaners are far more apt than their Democratic counterparts to say the country's best days have passed, 60% vs. 36%.Policy preferences show similar patterns. Eighty-eight percent of Republicans support mass deportation, as do 58% of independents, compared with 26% of Democrats. (That said, support for deportations has increased broadly compared with a 2016 survey, with the exception of views among Democrats and liberals.)On abortion, partisan divisions results are reversed: Eighty-seven percent of Democrats say the federal government should restore abortion access, as do 57% of independents, dropping to 27% of Republicans.Vote preferencesPolls are best used not to recite who's ahead, but to assess how and why the country is coming to its decision. It's also important to keep in mind that the ultimate winner of the popular vote may differ from the winner of the presidency, as demonstrated in 2016 and 2000 (and likewise, for history buffs, in 1888, 1876 and 1824).With Election Day drawing close and early voting underway, this poll includes slight departures from previous ABC/Ipsos polls this cycle in measuring vote preferences. Survey respondents are offered up to five candidates -- Harris, Trump, Jill Stein, Chase Oliver and Cornel West, and their running mates -- based on which of those candidates are on the ballot in the state where the respondent lives. (Robert F. Kennedy Jr., while on the ballot in 30 states and the District of Columbia, is not listed, since he's not actively running. Respondents can volunteer their support for Kennedy or anyone else.)In addition to being asked whom they'd support, respondents are given the option of saying they already voted. In this survey 1% had done so, a number likely to ramp up quickly.As mentioned, one shift in this poll is the result among men who are registered to vote -- 52-44% in Trump's favor, compared with a dead heat, 48-48%, in mid-September. That includes a 19-point Trump lead among white men and a close contest among Hispanic men and younger men (age 18-39) alike.A slight change is among independents, who, per exit polls, have voted for the winner in nine out of the last 12 presidential elections. Harris led among independents by 10 points, 51-41%, in mid-September, compared with a non-significant 5 points now, 49-44%.Harris, for her part, continues to lead among women by 9 points, 53-44%, aided by her showing among under-40, Black and Hispanic women. And she leads by 14 points among college graduates, 56-42%, among the more reliable groups for turnout.The 17-point gender gap between the candidates (Trump +8 among men, Harris +9 among women) is back to its typical level; it has averaged 19 points in exit polls since 1996. This reflects the fact that women are 8 points more apt than men to identify as Democrats.The contest stands at 82-13%, Harris-Trump, among Black people who are registered to vote; that compares with 87-12% in the 2020 exit poll (a slight 5 points lower for Harris; no better for Trump). Black women are at 87-10% now (compared with 90-9% in 2020); Black men are at 76-18% (compared with 79-19% four years ago). These differences from 2020 aren't statistically significant.Then there's the division of votes by state groupings. In what are thought to be safely and likely red states, Trump is comfortably ahead, 55-42%. In expected blue states, Harris is well ahead, 56-39%. And in the seven battleground states where the contest is expected to be close -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- it couldn't be closer: 49% for Harris, 49% for Trump.METHODOLOGY - This ABC News/Ipsos poll was conducted online via the probability-based Ipsos KnowledgePanel® Oct. 4-8, 2024, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 2,631 adults. Partisan divisions are 29-29-30%, Democrats-Republicans-independents. Results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2 percentage points, including the design effect, for the full sample. Error margins are larger for subgroups. For registered voters, the sample size is 2,226 and the error margin is 2 points. For likely voters, the sample size is 1,714 and the error margin is 2.5 points. Sampling error is not the only cause of differences in polls.The survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates, with sampling and data collection by Ipsos.

    "title": "Trump or Harris? Here are the 2024 stakes for airlines, banks, EVs, health care and more",
    "content": "Corporate insiders expect Harris to broadly continue President Joe Biden's policies, including his war on so-called junk fees across industries, although there is hope for a more moderate approach.With the U.S. election less than a month away, the country and its corporations are staring down two drastically different options.For airlines, banks, electric vehicle makers, health-care companies, media firms, restaurants and tech giants, the outcome of the presidential contest could result in stark differences in the rules they'll face, the mergers they'll be allowed to pursue, and the taxes they'll pay.During his last time in power, former President Donald Trump slashed the corporate tax rate, imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, and sought to cut regulation and red tape and discourage immigration, ideas he's expected to push again if he wins a second term.In contrast, Vice President Kamala Harris has endorsed hiking the tax rate on corporations to 28% from the 21% rate enacted under Trump, a move that would require congressional approval. Most business executives expect Harris to broadly continue President Joe Biden's policies, including his war on so-called junk fees across industries.Personnel is policy, as the saying goes, so the ramifications of the presidential race won't become clear until the winner begins appointments for as many as a dozen key bodies, including the Treasury, Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission, and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.CNBC examined the stakes of the 2024 presidential election for some of corporate America's biggest sectors. Here's what a Harris or Trump administration could mean for business:The result of the presidential election could affect everything from what airlines owe consumers for flight disruptions to how much it costs to build an aircraft in the United States.The Biden Department of Transportation, led by Secretary Pete Buttigieg, has taken a hard line on filling what it considers to be holes in air traveler protections. It has established or proposed new rules on issues including refunds for cancellations, family seating and service fee disclosures, a measure airlines have challenged in court.\"Who's in that DOT seat matters,\" said Jonathan Kletzel, who heads the travel, transportation and logistics practice at PwC.The current Democratic administration has also fought industry consolidation, winning two antitrust lawsuits that blocked a partnership between American Airlines and JetBlue Airways in the Northeast and JetBlue's now-scuttled plan to buy budget carrier Spirit Airlines.The previous Trump administration didn't pursue those types of consumer protections. Industry members say that under Trump, they would expect a more favorable environment for mergers, though four airlines already control more than three-quarters of the U.S. market.On the aerospace side, Boeing and the hundreds of suppliers that support it are seeking stability more than anything else.Trump has said on the campaign trail that he supports additional tariffs of 10% or 20% and higher duties on goods from China. That could drive up the cost of producing aircraft and other components for aerospace companies, just as a labor and skills shortage after the pandemic drives up expenses.Tariffs could also challenge the industry, if they spark retaliatory taxes or trade barriers to China and other countries, which are major buyers of aircraft from Boeing, a top U.S. exporter.-- Leslie JosephsBig banks such as JPMorgan Chase faced an onslaught of new rules this year as Biden appointees pursued the most significant slate of regulations since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.Those efforts threaten tens of billions of dollars in industry revenue by slashing fees that banks impose on credit cards and overdrafts and radically revising the capital and risk framework they operate in. The fate of all of those measures is at risk if Trump is elected.Trump is expected to nominate appointees for key financial regulators, including the CFPB, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that could result in a weakening or killing off completely of the myriad rules in play.\"The Biden administration's regulatory agenda across sectors has been very ambitious, especially in finance, and large swaths of it stand to be rolled back by Trump appointees if he wins,\" said Tobin Marcus, head of U.S. policy at Wolfe Research.Bank CEOs and consultants say it would be a relief if aspects of the Biden era -- an aggressive CFPB, regulators who discouraged most mergers and elongated times for deal approvals -- were dialed back.\"It certainly helps if the president is Republican, and the odds tilt more favorably for the industry if it's a Republican sweep\" in Congress, said the CEO of a bank with nearly $100 billion in assets who declined to be identified speaking about regulators.Still, some observers point out that Trump 2.0 might not be as friendly to the industry as his first time in office.Trump's vice presidential pick, Sen. JD Vance, of Ohio, has often criticized Wall Street banks, and Trump last month began pushing an idea to cap credit card interest rates at 10%, a move that if enacted would have seismic implications for the industry.Bankers also say that Harris won't necessarily cater to traditional Democratic Party ideas that have made life tougher for banks. Unless Democrats seize both chambers of Congress as well as the presidency, it may be difficult to get agency heads approved if they're considered partisan picks, experts note.\"I would not write off the vice president as someone who's automatically going to go more progressive,\" said Lindsey Johnson, head of the Consumer Bankers Association, a trade group for big U.S. retail banks.-- Hugh SonElectric vehicles have become a polarizing issue between Democrats and Republicans, especially in swing states such as Michigan that rely on the auto industry. There could be major changes in regulations and incentives for EVs if Trump regains power, a fact that's placed the industry in a temporary limbo.\"Depending on the election in the U.S., we may have mandates; we may not,\" Volkswagen Group of America CEO Pablo Di Si said Sept. 24 during an Automotive News conference. \"Am I going to make any decisions on future investments right now? Obviously not. We're waiting to see.\"Republicans, led by Trump, have largely condemned EVs, claiming they are being forced upon consumers and that they will ruin the U.S. automotive industry. Trump has vowed to roll back or eliminate many vehicle emissions standards under the Environmental Protection Agency and incentives to promote production and adoption of the vehicles.If elected, he's also expected to renew a battle with California and other states who set their own vehicle emissions standards.\"In a Republican win ... We see higher variance and more potential for change,\" UBS analyst Joseph Spak said in a Sept. 18 investor note.In contrast, Democrats, including Harris, have historically supported EVs and incentives such as those under the Biden administration's signature Inflation Reduction Act.Harris hasn't been as vocal a supporter of EVs lately amid slower-than-expected consumer adoption of the vehicles and consumer pushback. She has said she does not support an EV mandate such as the Zero-Emission Vehicles Act of 2019, which she cosponsored during her time as a senator, that would have required automakers to sell only electrified vehicles by 2040. Still, auto industry executives and officials expect a Harris presidency would be largely a continuation, though not a copy, of the past four years of Biden's EV policy.They expect some potential leniency on federal fuel economy regulations but minimal changes to the billions of dollars in incentives under the IRA.-- Mike WaylandBoth Harris and Trump have called for sweeping changes to the costly, complicated and entrenched U.S. health-care system of doctors, insurers, drug manufacturers and middlemen, which costs the nation more than $4 trillion a year.Despite spending more on health care than any other wealthy country, the U.S. has the lowest life expectancy at birth, the highest rate of people with multiple chronic diseases and the highest maternal and infant death rates, according to the Commonwealth Fund, an independent research group.Meanwhile, roughly half of American adults say it is difficult to afford health-care costs, which can drive some into debt or lead them to put off necessary care, according to a May poll conducted by health policy research organization KFF.Both Harris and Trump have taken aim at the pharmaceutical industry and proposed efforts to lower prescription drug prices in the U.S., which are nearly three times higher than those seen in other countries.But many of Trump's efforts to lower costs have been temporary or not immediately effective, health policy experts said. Meanwhile, Harris, if elected, can build on existing efforts of the Biden administration to deliver savings to more patients, they said.Harris specifically plans to expand certain provisions of the IRA, part of which aims to lower health-care costs for seniors enrolled in Medicare. Harris cast the tie-breaking Senate vote to pass the law in 2022.Her campaign says she plans to extend two provisions to all Americans, not just seniors: a $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket drug spending and a $35 limit on monthly insulin costs.Harris also intends to accelerate and expand a provision allowing Medicare to directly negotiate drug prices with manufacturers for the first time. Drugmakers fiercely oppose those price talks, with some challenging the effort's constitutionality in court.Trump hasn't publicly indicated what he intends to do about IRA provisions.Some of Trump's prior efforts to lower drug prices \"didn't really come into fruition\" during his presidency, according to Dr. Mariana Socal, a professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.For example, he planned to use executive action to have Medicare pay no more than the lowest price that select other developed countries pay for drugs, a proposal that was blocked by court action and later rescinded.Trump also led multiple efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, including its expansion of Medicaid to low-income adults. In a campaign video in April, Trump said he was not running on terminating the ACA and would rather make it \"much, much better and far less money,\" though he has provided no specific plans.He reiterated his belief that the ACA was \"lousy health care\" during his Sept. 10 debate with Harris. But when asked he did not offer a replacement proposal, saying only that he has \"concepts of a plan.\"-- Annika Kim ConstantinoTop of mind for media executives is mergers and the path, or lack thereof, to push them through.The media industry's state of turmoil -- shrinking audiences for traditional pay TV, the slowdown in advertising, and the rise of streaming and challenges in making it profitable -- means its companies are often mentioned in discussions of acquisitions and consolidation.While a merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media is set to move forward, with plans to close in the first half of 2025, many in media have said the Biden administration has broadly chilled deal-making.\"We just need an opportunity for deregulation, so companies can consolidate and do what we need to do even better,\" Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said in July at Allen & Co.'s annual Sun Valley conference.Media mogul John Malone recently told MoffettNathanson analysts that some deals are a nonstarter with this current Justice Department, including mergers between companies in the telecommunications and cable broadband space.Still, it's unclear how the regulatory environment could or would change depending on which party is in office. Disney was allowed to acquire Fox Corp.'s assets when Trump was in office, but his administration sued to block AT&T's merger with Time Warner. Meanwhile, under Biden's presidency, a federal judge blocked the sale of Simon & Schuster to Penguin Random House, but Amazon's acquisition of MGM was approved.\"My sense is, regardless of the election outcome, we are likely to remain in a similar tighter regulatory environment when looking at media industry dealmaking,\" said Marc DeBevoise, CEO and board director of Brightcove, a streaming technology company.When major media, and even tech, assets change hands, it could also mean increased scrutiny on those in control and whether it creates bias on the platforms.\"Overall, the government and FCC have always been most concerned with having a diversity of voices,\" said Jonathan Miller, chief executive of Integrated Media, which specializes in digital media investment.\"But then  happened, and it's clearly showing you can skew a platform to not just what the business needs, but to maybe your personal approach and whims,\" he said.Since Musk acquired the social media platform in 2022, changing its name to X, he has implemented sweeping changes including cutting staff and giving \"amnesty\" to previously suspended accounts, including Trump's, which had been suspended following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection. Musk has also faced widespread criticism from civil rights groups for the amplification of bigotry on the platform.Musk has publicly endorsed Trump, and was recently on the campaign trail with the former president. \"As you can see, I'm not just MAGA, I'm Dark MAGA,\" Musk said at a recent event. The billionaire has raised funds for Republican causes, and Trump has suggested Musk could eventually play a role in his administration if the Republican candidate were to be reelected.During his first term, Trump took a particularly hard stance against journalists, and pursued investigations into leaks from his administration to news organizations. Under Biden, the White House has been notably more amenable to journalists.Also top of mind for media executives -- and government officials -- is TikTok.Lawmakers have argued that TikTok's Chinese ownership could be a national security risk.Earlier this year, Biden signed legislation that gives Chinese parent ByteDance until January to find a new owner for the platform or face a U.S. ban. TikTok has said the bill, the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which passed with bipartisan support, violates the First Amendment. The platform has sued the government to stop a potential ban.While Trump was in office, he attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order, but the effort failed. However, he has more recently switched to supporting the platform, arguing that without it there's less competition against Meta's Facebook and other social media.-- Lillian Rizzo and Alex ShermanBoth Trump and Harris have endorsed plans to end taxes on restaurant workers' tips, although how they would do so is likely to differ.The food service and restaurant industry is the nation's second-largest private-sector employer, with 15.5 million jobs, according to the National Restaurant Association. Roughly 2.2 million of those employees are tipped servers and bartenders, who could end up with more money in their pockets if their tips are no longer taxed.Trump's campaign hasn't given much detail on how his administration would eliminate taxes on tips, but tax experts have warned that it could turn into a loophole for high earners. Claims from the Trump campaign that the Republican candidate is pro-labor have clashed with his record of appointing leaders to the National Labor Relations Board who have rolled back worker protections.Meanwhile, Harris has said she'd only exempt workers who make $75,000 or less from paying income tax on their tips, but the money would still be subject to taxes toward Social Security and Medicare, the Washington Post previously reported.\n\"In the short term, if  have to pay higher wages to their waiters, they're going to have to raise menu prices, which is going to lower demand,\" said Michael Lynn, a tipping expert and Cornell University professor.-- Amelia LucasWhichever candidate comes out ahead in November will have to grapple with the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence sector.Generative AI is the biggest story in tech since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022. It presents a conundrum for regulators, because it allows consumers to easily create text and images from simple queries, creating privacy and safety concerns.Harris has said she and Biden \"reject the false choice that suggests we can either protect the public or advance innovation.\" Last year, the White House issued an executive order that led to the formation of the Commerce Department's U.S. AI Safety Institute, which is evaluating AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic.Trump has committed to repealing the executive order.A second Trump administration might also attempt to challenge a Securities and Exchange Commission rule that requires companies to disclose cybersecurity incidents. The White House said in January that more transparency \"will incentivize corporate executives to invest in cybersecurity and cyber risk management.\"Trump's running mate, Vance, co-sponsored a bill designed to end the rule. Andrew Garbarino, the House Republican who introduced an identical bill, has said the SEC rule increases cybersecurity risk and overlaps with existing law on incident reporting.Also at stake in the election is the fate of dealmaking for tech investors and executives.With Lina Khan helming the FTC, the top tech companies have been largely thwarted from making big acquisitions, though the Justice Department and European regulators have also created hurdles.Tech transaction volume peaked at $1.5 trillion in 2021, then plummeted to $544 billion last year and $465 billion in 2024 as of September, according to Dealogic.Many in the tech industry are critical of Khan and want her to be replaced should Harris win in November. Meanwhile, Vance, who worked in venture capital before entering politics, said as recently as February -- before he was chosen as Trump's running mate -- that Khan was \"doing a pretty good job.\"Khan, whom Biden nominated in 2021, has challenged Amazon and Meta on antitrust grounds and has said the FTC will investigate AI investments at Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft.",

    "title": "2024 US presidential election: can we believe the polls?",
    "content": "Jérôme Viala-Gaudefroy does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.Nationwide polls are often of limited relevance, considering the unique structure of the US electoral system. To gain a better understanding of the upcoming presidential election, we need to focus on surveys conducted in the pivotal battlegrounds - the so-called swing states. After the missteps in previous elections, it's hard to place too much confidence in these polls, as many rely on unrepresentative samples.As we head toward the 2024 US presidential election, media large and small frequently fall into the trap of \"horse race\" journalism. Policy questions are rarely treated in depth, and the emphasis is often on the latest polls. One week they announce Kamala Harris as moving ahead, and the next, Donald Trump still has an edge. But how reliable are these polls?In the United States, rather than being elected by direct popular vote, the president is chosen indirectly through the Electoral College, an institution inscribed in the country's constitution. Each state is assigned a number of electors based in part on its population, but also on its number of senators. As a result, smaller states get a larger voice than their population would indicate.One of the implications is that national election polls can be deceiving. In most states with established partisan majorities, the outcomes are predictable due to the winner-takes-all approach. This system awards all of a state's electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote in that state (with the exception of Maine and Nebraska, which use a proportional system). As a result, the most relevant polls are those conducted in \"swing states\", where neither party holds a consistent advantage.According to recent analyses, around ten states are expected to be in play for 2024. Based on recent trends, there are seven swing states to watch: Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia. In the 2016 and 2020 elections, victory margins in these states were razor-thin, often less than 1%.With both Harris and Trump within striking distance of the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency, these swing states, with a combined 91 votes, will determine the outcome.The 2016 and 2020 polling failures: flukes or systemic issues?When the margins are so tight in these key states, accurately measuring voter intentions is an enormous challenge. In 2016, national polls correctly predicted Hillary Clinton's popular-vote win - she had nearly 3 million more than Trump. However, they failed to foresee Trump's Electorial College victories in critical states, which ultimately put him over the top.The American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) pointed out several reasons for these errors, including underrepresentation of Republican voters, over-representation of college-educated voters (who tend to lean Democratic), and an underestimation of undecided voters who eventually voted for Trump or third-party candidates.Despite efforts to fix these problems, other biases showed up in 2020. While graduate voters were not over-represented and undecideds were evenly split between Biden and Trump, the Covid-19 pandemic had made the pollsters' task more complicated. AAPOR points out that the states with a higher proportion of Covid-19 cases were the ones with the highest polling errors. As a result, pollsters underestimated Trump's vote share in key swing states and also overestimated Biden's national lead, making the 2020 polls the least accurate in 40 years.Despite these errors, Biden still triumphed, winning 4 percent more of the popular vote and taking home 306 electoral votes to Trump's 232. Biden's victories in the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin make all the difference.Polling errors and public distrustErrors of this magnitude naturally increase the public's scepticism of polling, especially among Republicans, who are already wary of establishment institutions. Contrary to initial assumptions, Trump voters didn't hesitate to express their preferences in 2016 and 2020. However, they were less likely to participate in polls due in part to their distrust of mainstream institutions. As a result, working-class white voters - and their opinions - were underrepresented in many polls.Pollsters also face technical challenges. Getting a respondent on the phone now requires calling hundreds of people, thanks to caller ID and call screening. Polls with smaller samples (fewer than 1,000 respondents) are less reliable. To deal with these hurdles, many pollsters are now using a mix of methods, including e-mail, online surveys, and robocalls.Though cheaper, online surveys often draw voluntary participants who are compensated, which leads to issues of accuracy and representation. This growing reliance on online polling has contributed to a doubling of polling companies from 2000 to 2022, according to Pew Research Center.Margin of error and identifying \"likely\" votersThe margin of error is a critical component of polling that is often misunderstood by the public and media. It typically falls between 3 and 4 percentage points, but for smaller demographic groups (for example, young people, white men, or Hispanics), it can be even higher. Media headlines, however, frequently imply a candidate is leading, even when the difference is within the margin of error. University of California, Berkeley researchers suggest that to ensure 95% accuracy, the margin of error should be closer to 6%.However, the media sometimes amplify results, particularly in headlines, by implying that a candidate is ahead, even when the difference is within the margin of error. Moreover, researchers at the University of Berkeley have shown that to guarantee 95% accuracy, this margin should be increased to at least 6%. This means a candidate projected to receive 54% of the vote is likely, in reality, to secure anywhere between 48% and 60%, reflecting an actual margin of error of 12 percentage points.Another significant challenge for pollsters is identifying likely voters. Only around two-thirds of citizens eligible to vote actually go to the polls. In 2016, turnout on the Democratic side was overestimated, giving the false impression that Clinton was a lock for victory. This likely caused some of her supporters to stay home, while Trump's base showed up in force when polls suggested he was behind. Accurately predicting who will turn out to vote is crucial to polling accuracy.Lessons from the 2022 midterms: A glimmer of hope for 2024?Polling showed notable improvements during the 2022 midterm elections, with the results being the most accurate since 1998. Importantly, there was no significant bias toward either party. However, midterm elections operate differently than presidential elections, and the dynamics for 2024 may be very different. That said, many polling institutions have adapted since 2016: as of 2022, 61% of polling firms had changed their methods, such as refining sampling techniques and improving question wording. More than a third have changed their methods after 2020.While these changes are positive, challenges remain, especially in predicting turnout and combating low response rates.What good are polls, then?At the end of the day, election polls offer snapshots - often imprecise - and can only provide general trends. Polling methods vary across firms, introducing biases that make it difficult to compare results.Survey aggregators offer averages that might be more reliable than individual polls, but they still come with a degree of uncertainty. This is true for FiveThirtyEight, the well-known website founded by statistics guru Nate Silver. After ABC took over in 2023, Silver left, taking his forecasting model with him to his new platform, Silver Bulletin, which continues to attract significant media attention.With the unpredictability of polls, political betting markets have become popular as polling alternatives. Platforms like Polymarket, which recently hired Silver, have multiplied rapidly. Some people, like Elon Musk, argue that markets provide better forecasts than traditional polls, though this claim is unproven. There are also concerns that these markets could be manipulated to sway public opinion.While opinion polls aren't the best tools for predicting elections - as this could be one of the closest in recent history - their value lies in gauging public opinion on key issues. However, even in this role, polls can still be biased, often influenced by how questions are phrased.For example, in 2019 USA Today ran the headline \"Poll: Half of Americans say Trump is victim of a 'witch hunt' as trust in Mueller erodes\". This was in reference to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The question asked by the poll was:\"President Trump has called the special counsel's investigation a 'witch hunt' and said he has been investigated more than previous presidents for political reasons. Do you agree?\"The problem with this wording is that it combined two different ideas: whether the investigation was a \"witch hunt\" and whether Trump had been unfairly targeted for political reasons. On top of that, the question lacked neutrality, presenting only his perspective.Naturally, Trump used the result to his advantage, even though other polls from sources such as The Washington Post, CBS News, and NPR-PBS told a different story.To use polling data wisely during this election, it's crucial to recognize these limitations and pay attention to the fine print - details like the sample size, polling date, margin of error, and methodology. Additionally, consider the poll's sponsors, who may only release results that align with their particular agenda.Ultimately, the best way to interpret polling data is with caution, focusing on general trends rather than any single poll. And always remember, election outcomes can be full of surprises.",

    "title": "2024 US Elections: Trump, Harris locked in a tight race, says WSJ Poll",
    "content": "As the countdown to the November 5, 2024 presidential election accelerates, a new Wall Street Journal poll indicates that Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and Republican contender Donald Trump are locked in a fierce contest for the presidency.The poll highlights the razor-thin margins in several critical battleground states, suggesting a neck-and-neck race that could determine the election's outcome.Battleground state dynamicsThe Wall Street Journal's latest findings reveal that both candidates are within two percentage points of each other in six of the seven key swing states deemed essential for a successful electoral strategy. Harris is currently leading in Arizona, Georgia, and Michigan, while Trump holds an advantage in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Nevada.Notably, the margin in Nevada stands out, with Trump leading Harris by five percentage points -- a significant gap in what has otherwise been a closely contested race.The survey was conducted with a sample of 600 registered voters per state between September 28 and October 8, reflecting the evolving political landscape as the election date approaches.Voter sentiment and campaign strategiesThe proximity of the candidates in these battlegrounds underscores the critical role voter sentiment will play in the upcoming election.Harris has been actively courting Arab and Muslim voters amid rising tensions regarding the situation in Israel, hoping to solidify support in communities that may feel alienated by current administration policies.In contrast, Trump has maintained a focus on energizing his base, leveraging discontent among traditional Republican voters.As both campaigns ramp up their efforts, the candidates are making strategic appearances and tailoring their messages to resonate with key demographic groups.For instance, Harris recently hosted a town hall in Las Vegas aimed at Latino voters, recognizing the significant influence this population could wield in pivotal states like Nevada.Implications for the electionThe Wall Street Journal's findings reflect a broader narrative of a deeply polarized electorate, with the outcome likely hinging on voter turnout and engagement in the final weeks of the campaign.With both candidates pulling out all the stops to sway undecided voters, the stakes have never been higher.As the candidates prepare for the next presidential debate and intensify their campaign efforts, political analysts are closely watching voter sentiment shifts in these battleground states.The tight race is not only a reflection of each candidate's strengths and weaknesses but also highlights the critical issues that resonate with American voters in this election cycle.ConclusionWith less than a month until Election Day, the Trump-Harris contest is shaping up to be one of the most competitive races in recent history.As the candidates continue to navigate the complex political landscape and address the concerns of diverse voter groups, the final results remain uncertain.Both campaigns are aware that every vote will count in what could be a historic election for the United States.",

    "title": "Trump or Harris? Here are the 2024 stakes for airlines, banks, EVs, health care and more",
    "content": "With the U.S. election less than a month away, the country and its corporations are staring down two drastically different options.For airlines, banks, electric vehicle makers, health-care companies, media firms, restaurants and tech giants, the outcome of the presidential contest could result in stark differences in the rules they'll face, the mergers they'll be allowed to pursue, and the taxes they'll pay.During his last time in power, former President Donald Trump slashed the corporate tax rate, imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, and sought to cut regulation and red tape and discourage immigration, ideas he's expected to push again if he wins a second term.In contrast, Vice President Kamala Harris has endorsed hiking the tax rate on corporations to 28% from the 21% rate enacted under Trump, a move that would require congressional approval. Most business executives expect Harris to broadly continue President Joe Biden's policies, including his war on so-called junk fees across industries.Personnel is policy, as the saying goes, so the ramifications of the presidential race won't become clear until the winner begins appointments for as many as a dozen key bodies, including the Treasury, Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission, and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.CNBC examined the stakes of the 2024 presidential election for some of corporate America's biggest sectors. Here's what a Harris or Trump administration could mean for business:The result of the presidential election could affect everything from what airlines owe consumers for flight disruptions to how much it costs to build an aircraft in the United States.The Biden Department of Transportation, led by Secretary Pete Buttigieg, has taken a hard line on filling what it considers to be holes in air traveler protections. It has established or proposed new rules on issues including refunds for cancellations, family seating and service fee disclosures, a measure airlines have challenged in court.\"Who's in that DOT seat matters,\" said Jonathan Kletzel, who heads the travel, transportation and logistics practice at PwC.The current Democratic administration has also fought industry consolidation, winning two antitrust lawsuits that blocked a partnership between American Airlines and JetBlue Airways in the Northeast and JetBlue's now-scuttled plan to buy budget carrier Spirit Airlines.The previous Trump administration didn't pursue those types of consumer protections. Industry members say that under Trump, they would expect a more favorable environment for mergers, though four airlines already control more than three-quarters of the U.S. market.On the aerospace side, Boeing and the hundreds of suppliers that support it are seeking stability more than anything else.Trump has said on the campaign trail that he supports additional tariffs of 10% or 20% and higher duties on goods from China. That could drive up the cost of producing aircraft and other components for aerospace companies, just as a labor and skills shortage after the pandemic drives up expenses.Tariffs could also challenge the industry, if they spark retaliatory taxes or trade barriers to China and other countries, which are major buyers of aircraft from Boeing, a top U.S. exporter.-- Leslie JosephsBig banks such as JPMorgan Chase faced an onslaught of new rules this year as Biden appointees pursued the most significant slate of regulations since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.Those efforts threaten tens of billions of dollars in industry revenue by slashing fees that banks impose on credit cards and overdrafts and radically revising the capital and risk framework they operate in. The fate of all of those measures is at risk if Trump is elected.Trump is expected to nominate appointees for key financial regulators, including the CFPB, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that could result in a weakening or killing off completely of the myriad rules in play.\"The Biden administration's regulatory agenda across sectors has been very ambitious, especially in finance, and large swaths of it stand to be rolled back by Trump appointees if he wins,\" said Tobin Marcus, head of U.S. policy at Wolfe Research.Bank CEOs and consultants say it would be a relief if aspects of the Biden era -- an aggressive CFPB, regulators who discouraged most mergers and elongated times for deal approvals -- were dialed back.\"It certainly helps if the president is Republican, and the odds tilt more favorably for the industry if it's a Republican sweep\" in Congress, said the CEO of a bank with nearly $100 billion in assets who declined to be identified speaking about regulators.Still, some observers point out that Trump 2.0 might not be as friendly to the industry as his first time in office.Trump's vice presidential pick, Sen. JD Vance, of Ohio, has often criticized Wall Street banks, and Trump last month began pushing an idea to cap credit card interest rates at 10%, a move that if enacted would have seismic implications for the industry.Bankers also say that Harris won't necessarily cater to traditional Democratic Party ideas that have made life tougher for banks. Unless Democrats seize both chambers of Congress as well as the presidency, it may be difficult to get agency heads approved if they're considered partisan picks, experts note.\"I would not write off the vice president as someone who's automatically going to go more progressive,\" said Lindsey Johnson, head of the Consumer Bankers Association, a trade group for big U.S. retail banks.-- Hugh SonElectric vehicles have become a polarizing issue between Democrats and Republicans, especially in swing states such as Michigan that rely on the auto industry. There could be major changes in regulations and incentives for EVs if Trump regains power, a fact that's placed the industry in a temporary limbo.\"Depending on the election in the U.S., we may have mandates; we may not,\" Volkswagen Group of America CEO Pablo Di Si said Sept. 24 during an Automotive News conference. \"Am I going to make any decisions on future investments right now? Obviously not. We're waiting to see.\"Republicans, led by Trump, have largely condemned EVs, claiming they are being forced upon consumers and that they will ruin the U.S. automotive industry. Trump has vowed to roll back or eliminate many vehicle emissions standards under the Environmental Protection Agency and incentives to promote production and adoption of the vehicles.If elected, he's also expected to renew a battle with California and other states who set their own vehicle emissions standards.\"In a Republican win ... We see higher variance and more potential for change,\" UBS analyst Joseph Spak said in a Sept. 18 investor note.In contrast, Democrats, including Harris, have historically supported EVs and incentives such as those under the Biden administration's signature Inflation Reduction Act.Harris hasn't been as vocal a supporter of EVs lately amid slower-than-expected consumer adoption of the vehicles and consumer pushback. She has said she does not support an EV mandate such as the Zero-Emission Vehicles Act of 2019, which she cosponsored during her time as a senator, that would have required automakers to sell only electrified vehicles by 2040. Still, auto industry executives and officials expect a Harris presidency would be largely a continuation, though not a copy, of the past four years of Biden's EV policy.They expect some potential leniency on federal fuel economy regulations but minimal changes to the billions of dollars in incentives under the IRA.-- Mike WaylandBoth Harris and Trump have called for sweeping changes to the costly, complicated and entrenched U.S. health-care system of doctors, insurers, drug manufacturers and middlemen, which costs the nation more than $4 trillion a year.Despite spending more on health care than any other wealthy country, the U.S. has the lowest life expectancy at birth, the highest rate of people with multiple chronic diseases and the highest maternal and infant death rates, according to the Commonwealth Fund, an independent research group.Meanwhile, roughly half of American adults say it is difficult to afford health-care costs, which can drive some into debt or lead them to put off necessary care, according to a May poll conducted by health policy research organization KFF.Both Harris and Trump have taken aim at the pharmaceutical industry and proposed efforts to lower prescription drug prices in the U.S., which are nearly three times higher than those seen in other countries.But many of Trump's efforts to lower costs have been temporary or not immediately effective, health policy experts said. Meanwhile, Harris, if elected, can build on existing efforts of the Biden administration to deliver savings to more patients, they said.Harris specifically plans to expand certain provisions of the IRA, part of which aims to lower health-care costs for seniors enrolled in Medicare. Harris cast the tie-breaking Senate vote to pass the law in 2022.Her campaign says she plans to extend two provisions to all Americans, not just seniors: a $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket drug spending and a $35 limit on monthly insulin costs.Harris also intends to accelerate and expand a provision allowing Medicare to directly negotiate drug prices with manufacturers for the first time. Drugmakers fiercely oppose those price talks, with some challenging the effort's constitutionality in court.Trump hasn't publicly indicated what he intends to do about IRA provisions.Some of Trump's prior efforts to lower drug prices \"didn't really come into fruition\" during his presidency, according to Dr. Mariana Socal, a professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.For example, he planned to use executive action to have Medicare pay no more than the lowest price that select other developed countries pay for drugs, a proposal that was blocked by court action and later rescinded.Trump also led multiple efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, including its expansion of Medicaid to low-income adults.

Roughly 2.2 million of those employees are tipped servers and bartenders, who could end up with more money in their pockets if their tips are no longer taxed.Trump's campaign hasn't given much detail on how his administration would eliminate taxes on tips, but tax experts have warned that it could turn into a loophole for high earners. Claims from the Trump campaign that the Republican candidate is pro-labor have clashed with his record of appointing leaders to the National Labor Relations Board who have rolled back worker protections.Meanwhile, Harris has said she'd only exempt workers who make $75,000 or less from paying income tax on their tips, but the money would still be subject to taxes toward Social Security and Medicare, the Washington Post previously reported.\n\"In the short term, if  have to pay higher wages to their waiters, they're going to have to raise menu prices, which is going to lower demand,\" said Michael Lynn, a tipping expert and Cornell University professor.-- Amelia LucasWhichever candidate comes out ahead in November will have to grapple with the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence sector.Generative AI is the biggest story in tech since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022.

Meanwhile, Vance, who worked in venture capital before entering politics, said as recently as February -- before he was chosen as Trump's running mate -- that Khan was \"doing a pretty good job.\"Khan, whom Biden nominated in 2021, has challenged Amazon and Meta on antitrust grounds and has said the FTC will investigate AI investments at Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft.",

    "title": "Trump or Harris? Here are the 2024 stakes for airlines, banks, EVs, health care and more",
    "content": "📺 Watch News4 now: Stream NBC4 newscasts for free right here, right now.With the U.S. election less than a month away, the country and its corporations are staring down two drastically different options.For airlines, banks, electric vehicle makers, health-care companies, media firms, restaurants and tech giants, the outcome of the presidential contest could result in stark differences in the rules they'll face, the mergers they'll be allowed to pursue, and the taxes they'll pay.During his last time in power, former President Donald Trump slashed the corporate tax rate, imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, and sought to cut regulation and red tape and discourage immigration, ideas he's expected to push again if he wins a second term.In contrast, Vice President Kamala Harris has endorsed hiking the tax rate on corporations to 28% from the 21% rate enacted under Trump, a move that would require congressional approval. Most business executives expect Harris to broadly continue President Joe Biden's policies, including his war on so-called junk fees across industries.Personnel is policy, as the saying goes, so the ramifications of the presidential race won't become clear until the winner begins appointments for as many as a dozen key bodies, including the Treasury, Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission, and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.CNBC examined the stakes of the 2024 presidential election for some of corporate America's biggest sectors. Here's what a Harris or Trump administration could mean for business:The result of the presidential election could affect everything from what airlines owe consumers for flight disruptions to how much it costs to build an aircraft in the United States.The Biden Department of Transportation, led by Secretary Pete Buttigieg, has taken a hard line on filling what it considers to be holes in air traveler protections. It has established or proposed new rules on issues including refunds for cancellations, family seating and service fee disclosures, a measure airlines have challenged in court.\"Who's in that DOT seat matters,\" said Jonathan Kletzel, who heads the travel, transportation and logistics practice at PwC.The current Democratic administration has also fought industry consolidation, winning two antitrust lawsuits that blocked a partnership between American Airlines and JetBlue Airways in the Northeast and JetBlue's now-scuttled plan to buy budget carrier Spirit Airlines.The previous Trump administration didn't pursue those types of consumer protections. Industry members say that under Trump, they would expect a more favorable environment for mergers, though four airlines already control more than three-quarters of the U.S. market.On the aerospace side, Boeing and the hundreds of suppliers that support it are seeking stability more than anything else.Trump has said on the campaign trail that he supports additional tariffs of 10% or 20% and higher duties on goods from China. That could drive up the cost of producing aircraft and other components for aerospace companies, just as a labor and skills shortage after the pandemic drives up expenses.Tariffs could also challenge the industry, if they spark retaliatory taxes or trade barriers to China and other countries, which are major buyers of aircraft from Boeing, a top U.S. exporter.-- Leslie JosephsBig banks such as JPMorgan Chase faced an onslaught of new rules this year as Biden appointees pursued the most significant slate of regulations since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.Those efforts threaten tens of billions of dollars in industry revenue by slashing fees that banks impose on credit cards and overdrafts and radically revising the capital and risk framework they operate in. The fate of all of those measures is at risk if Trump is elected.Trump is expected to nominate appointees for key financial regulators, including the CFPB, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that could result in a weakening or killing off completely of the myriad rules in play.\"The Biden administration's regulatory agenda across sectors has been very ambitious, especially in finance, and large swaths of it stand to be rolled back by Trump appointees if he wins,\" said Tobin Marcus, head of U.S. policy at Wolfe Research.Bank CEOs and consultants say it would be a relief if aspects of the Biden era -- an aggressive CFPB, regulators who discouraged most mergers and elongated times for deal approvals -- were dialed back.\"It certainly helps if the president is Republican, and the odds tilt more favorably for the industry if it's a Republican sweep\" in Congress, said the CEO of a bank with nearly $100 billion in assets who declined to be identified speaking about regulators.Still, some observers point out that Trump 2.0 might not be as friendly to the industry as his first time in office.Trump's vice presidential pick, Sen. JD Vance, of Ohio, has often criticized Wall Street banks, and Trump last month began pushing an idea to cap credit card interest rates at 10%, a move that if enacted would have seismic implications for the industry.Bankers also say that Harris won't necessarily cater to traditional Democratic Party ideas that have made life tougher for banks. Unless Democrats seize both chambers of Congress as well as the presidency, it may be difficult to get agency heads approved if they're considered partisan picks, experts note.\"I would not write off the vice president as someone who's automatically going to go more progressive,\" said Lindsey Johnson, head of the Consumer Bankers Association, a trade group for big U.S. retail banks.-- Hugh SonElectric vehicles have become a polarizing issue between Democrats and Republicans, especially in swing states such as Michigan that rely on the auto industry. There could be major changes in regulations and incentives for EVs if Trump regains power, a fact that's placed the industry in a temporary limbo.\"Depending on the election in the U.S., we may have mandates; we may not,\" Volkswagen Group of America CEO Pablo Di Si said Sept. 24 during an Automotive News conference. \"Am I going to make any decisions on future investments right now? Obviously not. We're waiting to see.\"Republicans, led by Trump, have largely condemned EVs, claiming they are being forced upon consumers and that they will ruin the U.S. automotive industry. Trump has vowed to roll back or eliminate many vehicle emissions standards under the Environmental Protection Agency and incentives to promote production and adoption of the vehicles.If elected, he's also expected to renew a battle with California and other states who set their own vehicle emissions standards.\"In a Republican win ... We see higher variance and more potential for change,\" UBS analyst Joseph Spak said in a Sept. 18 investor note.In contrast, Democrats, including Harris, have historically supported EVs and incentives such as those under the Biden administration's signature Inflation Reduction Act.Harris hasn't been as vocal a supporter of EVs lately amid slower-than-expected consumer adoption of the vehicles and consumer pushback. She has said she does not support an EV mandate such as the Zero-Emission Vehicles Act of 2019, which she cosponsored during her time as a senator, that would have required automakers to sell only electrified vehicles by 2040. Still, auto industry executives and officials expect a Harris presidency would be largely a continuation, though not a copy, of the past four years of Biden's EV policy.They expect some potential leniency on federal fuel economy regulations but minimal changes to the billions of dollars in incentives under the IRA.-- Mike WaylandBoth Harris and Trump have called for sweeping changes to the costly, complicated and entrenched U.S. health-care system of doctors, insurers, drug manufacturers and middlemen, which costs the nation more than $4 trillion a year.Despite spending more on health care than any other wealthy country, the U.S. has the lowest life expectancy at birth, the highest rate of people with multiple chronic diseases and the highest maternal and infant death rates, according to the Commonwealth Fund, an independent research group.Meanwhile, roughly half of American adults say it is difficult to afford health-care costs, which can drive some into debt or lead them to put off necessary care, according to a May poll conducted by health policy research organization KFF.Both Harris and Trump have taken aim at the pharmaceutical industry and proposed efforts to lower prescription drug prices in the U.S., which are nearly three times higher than those seen in other countries.But many of Trump's efforts to lower costs have been temporary or not immediately effective, health policy experts said. Meanwhile, Harris, if elected, can build on existing efforts of the Biden administration to deliver savings to more patients, they said.Harris specifically plans to expand certain provisions of the IRA, part of which aims to lower health-care costs for seniors enrolled in Medicare. Harris cast the tie-breaking Senate vote to pass the law in 2022.Her campaign says she plans to extend two provisions to all Americans, not just seniors: a $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket drug spending and a $35 limit on monthly insulin costs.Harris also intends to accelerate and expand a provision allowing Medicare to directly negotiate drug prices with manufacturers for the first time. Drugmakers fiercely oppose those price talks, with some challenging the effort's constitutionality in court.Trump hasn't publicly indicated what he intends to do about IRA provisions.Some of Trump's prior efforts to lower drug prices \"didn't really come into fruition\" during his presidency, according to Dr. Mariana Socal, a professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.For example, he planned to use executive action to have Medicare pay no more than the lowest price that select other developed countries pay for drugs, a proposal that was blocked by court action and later rescinded.Trump also led multiple efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, including its expansion of Medicaid to low-income adults. In a campaign video in April, Trump said he was not running on terminating the ACA and would rather make it \"much, much better and far less money,\" though he has provided no specific plans.He reiterated his belief that the ACA was \"lousy health care\" during his Sept. 10 debate with Harris. But when asked he did not offer a replacement proposal, saying only that he has \"concepts of a plan.\"-- Annika Kim ConstantinoTop of mind for media executives is mergers and the path, or lack thereof, to push them through.The media industry's state of turmoil -- shrinking audiences for traditional pay TV, the slowdown in advertising, and the rise of streaming and challenges in making it profitable -- means its companies are often mentioned in discussions of acquisitions and consolidation.While a merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media is set to move forward, with plans to close in the first half of 2025, many in media have said the Biden administration has broadly chilled deal-making.\"We just need an opportunity for deregulation, so companies can consolidate and do what we need to do even better,\" Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said in July at Allen & Co.'s annual Sun Valley conference.Media mogul John Malone recently told MoffettNathanson analysts that some deals are a nonstarter with this current Justice Department, including mergers between companies in the telecommunications and cable broadband space.Still, it's unclear how the regulatory environment could or would change depending on which party is in office. Disney was allowed to acquire Fox Corp.'s assets when Trump was in office, but his administration sued to block AT&T's merger with Time Warner. Meanwhile, under Biden's presidency, a federal judge blocked the sale of Simon & Schuster to Penguin Random House, but Amazon's acquisition of MGM was approved.\"My sense is, regardless of the election outcome, we are likely to remain in a similar tighter regulatory environment when looking at media industry dealmaking,\" said Marc DeBevoise, CEO and board director of Brightcove, a streaming technology company.When major media, and even tech, assets change hands, it could also mean increased scrutiny on those in control and whether it creates bias on the platforms.\"Overall, the government and FCC have always been most concerned with having a diversity of voices,\" said Jonathan Miller, chief executive of Integrated Media, which specializes in digital media investment.\"But then  happened, and it's clearly showing you can skew a platform to not just what the business needs, but to maybe your personal approach and whims,\" he said.Since Musk acquired the social media platform in 2022, changing its name to X, he has implemented sweeping changes including cutting staff and giving \"amnesty\" to previously suspended accounts, including Trump's, which had been suspended following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection. Musk has also faced widespread criticism from civil rights groups for the amplification of bigotry on the platform.Musk has publicly endorsed Trump, and was recently on the campaign trail with the former president. \"As you can see, I'm not just MAGA, I'm Dark MAGA,\" Musk said at a recent event. The billionaire has raised funds for Republican causes, and Trump has suggested Musk could eventually play a role in his administration if the Republican candidate were to be reelected.During his first term, Trump took a particularly hard stance against journalists, and pursued investigations into leaks from his administration to news organizations. Under Biden, the White House has been notably more amenable to journalists.Also top of mind for media executives -- and government officials -- is TikTok.Lawmakers have argued that TikTok's Chinese ownership could be a national security risk.Earlier this year, Biden signed legislation that gives Chinese parent ByteDance until January to find a new owner for the platform or face a U.S. ban. TikTok has said the bill, the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which passed with bipartisan support, violates the First Amendment. The platform has sued the government to stop a potential ban.While Trump was in office, he attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order, but the effort failed. However, he has more recently switched to supporting the platform, arguing that without it there's less competition against Meta's Facebook and other social media.-- Lillian Rizzo and Alex ShermanBoth Trump and Harris have endorsed plans to end taxes on restaurant workers' tips, although how they would do so is likely to differ.The food service and restaurant industry is the nation's second-largest private-sector employer, with 15.5 million jobs, according to the National Restaurant Association.

    "title": "Obama's challenge to Black men: Don't fall for Trump's lies",
    "content": "Obama is asking all men, including Black men, to rethink our relationship with women in positions of power, and to reevaluate our understanding of manhood.By Keith Boykin\"Black Vote, Black Power,\" a collaboration between Keith Boykin and Word In Black, examines the issues, the candidates, and what's at stake for Black America in the 2024 presidential election.Former President Barack Obama just ignited a firestorm of debate about Black men and manhood. Speaking to Black men in Pittsburgh on Oct. 10, Obama warned about the attitude of \"sitting out\" of the election \"or supporting somebody who has a history of denigrating you because you think that's a sign of strength.\"\"Putting women down\" is \"not acceptable,\" he said.His comment sparked criticism from those who felt Obama was scolding Black men again. I have a more nuanced take with two key points.Black Men Are a Success StoryFirst, Black men are a success story for Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party. After all the gaslighting from Republicans about Black men leaving the Democratic Party four years ago, Joe Biden won 87 percent of the vote from Black men in 2020. That makes us the second most loyal constituency of the Democratic Party. Only Black women, who voted 95 percent for Biden, are more supportive.A Washington Post-Ipsos poll last month found Black men overwhelmingly support Harris over Trump on every issue, including abortion, crime, the economy, and immigration. The Pew Research Center found that Black men are more confident in Kamala Harris than Trump to make good decisions about issues that affect us. A CNN poll last month found very little gender divide among Black voters. And research this summer found that Black men in Georgia supported Kamala Harris and strongly disapproved of Trump.That means Kamala Harris will probably win 85 percent to 90 percent of Black men. That's good news, and Black men should be celebrated for that.Personally, I don't understand how any Black man could vote for Trump after he led a lynch mob against the now exonerated Central Park Five, lied about Barack Obama's birth certificate, blackballed Colin Kapernick out of the NFL, and bragged about bringing back racist policing tactics like stop-and-frisk. But I also know that unanimity of opinion is unattainable. No candidate or party is ever going to get 100 percent of Black people to support them, but 87 percent is pretty damn good.That's why I've said before that we can't pathologize Black men for our voting patterns when other groups, mainly White women, are the real problem.An Internal Conversation With Black MenThat brings me to my second point. Contrary to the hot takes on social media, I don't think Obama was scolding or pathologizing Black men. Instead, he was having an internal conversation with Black men to get us to examine some of the reasons that some of us don't support Kamala Harris. That's why the Black men Obama was speaking to in the room seemed to agree with him.The question is how do you increase voter turnout for Black men, when 66 percent of Black men said they planned to vote compared to 71 percent of Black women, and that tiny gap could make a huge difference in a close election.Obama made a point that a small but vocal contingent of men, including Black men, refuse to support any woman candidate for president. Many of them have unrealistically high expectations for Kamala Harris but don't hold Trump to the same standards.One Black man in Pennsylvania told reporters he plans to vote for Trump because Harris \"doesn't come from a background similar to the majority of Black Americans.\" That makes no sense. Does he think a White man who spent his career refusing to rent to Black people and spreading racist lies about us understands the Black experience better than a Black woman who grew up in Oakland, attended Howard University, and joined AKA sorority? I'm sorry. I call bullshit. That man just doesn't want to vote for a woman.Obama wasn't speaking to all Black men. He was speaking to that man and to the Black men who have no problem with Trump selling cheap mugshots and $400 gold sneakers as \"Black outreach\" but when a Black woman who spent her entire life around Black people tries to get them to vote for her it's considered \"pandering.\" Just stop lying about why you're voting for Trump because you're making yourself sound ridiculous.\"And you're coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses, I've got a problem with that,\" Obama said. \"Because part of it makes me think -- and I'm speaking to men directly -- part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.\"It's the exact same message that Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul delivered on the \"Win With Black Men\" Zoom call with 40,000 Black men supporting Kamala Harris in July. \"Sometimes as Black men we get confused as to what strength is, and sometimes we think that standing behind a Black woman as a leader does not display strength as Black men,\" Raoul said.So why are we acting all new with Obama?He wasn't just focused on Black men. He delivered a similar message to all men at a rally in Pittsburgh the same day. \"I'm sorry, gentlemen -- I've noticed this, especially with some men who seem to think Trump's behavior, the bullying and the putting people down, is a sign of strength,\" he said. \"I am here to tell you that is not what real strength is and has never been.\"Part of the confusion may be that critics thought he was shaming the Black men in the room when actually he was describing an issue he's seen among other men in the community. But Obama is asking all men, including Black men, to rethink our relationship with women in positions of power, and to reevaluate our understanding of manhood.Being a man is not about controlling women, mocking the weak, or insulting the vulnerable. That's a caricature of manhood that Trump creates. Manhood is about honesty, fairness, responsibility, duty, and courage. A real man is secure enough in his identity to stand up in a crowd of \"yes men\" and tell them \"No\" when they do wrong.True manhood is powerful. It's about using our strength not just to help ourselves, but to help those in need.Keith Boykin is a New York Times-bestselling author, TV and film producer, and former CNN political commentator.

    "title": "Economic discontent, issue divisions add up to tight presidential contest: POLL",
    "content": "Harris has 50% support to Trump's 48% among likely voters, the poll finds.Dreary economic attitudes and sharply divergent views on social policies mark the 2024 presidential election, contributing to a tighter contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump: Just 2 percentage points now divide them in a new ABC News/Ipsos poll.Harris has 50% support to Trump's 48% among likely voters in the national survey, with a similar 49-47% result among all registered voters. (Among all adults, regardless of registration status, it's a single-point race, 49-48%, excluding those who wouldn't vote.)The results are slightly closer than Harris' +5 points among likely voters and the general public, and +4 among registered voters, in the last ABC/Ipsos poll in mid-September. A gain for Trump among men -- he's now +8 points among those registered to vote -- is a factor, as is a slip for Harris among independents, often swing voters.See PDF for full results.Beneath the horse race, issues pull in opposite directions. The poll, produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates, with fieldwork by Ipsos, finds that 56% of Americans now favor deporting all undocumented immigrants, up 20 points from eight years ago. That reinforces one of Trump's strongest issues, with a 10-point Trump lead in trust to handle immigration at the southern border.Yet the same share, 56%, side with Harris on abortion, saying the federal government should restore access to what it was before the Supreme Court eliminated the constitutional right to abortion in 2022. Many fewer, 41%, favor Trump's view that each state should decide. It follows that abortion is Harris' best issue in this poll, with a 15-point lead over Trump in trust on it.Then there's the economy, and related to it, a sharp division on the nation's future. As reported Friday, 44% of Americans say they're not as well off now as they were when Biden took office, tying the most negative number on this question in data since 1986.Further, while inflation has eased and employment is strong, those gains haven't hit home for most people: 59% say the economy is getting worse, more than twice as many as say it's getting better, 23%. And among registered voters who say the economy's worsening, Trump leads Harris by a sweeping 53 points, 74-21%.Largely informed by economic attitudes, registered voters divide, 51-47%, on whether America's best days are still ahead, or behind it. This in turn relates to candidate choice: Trump, with his message of national decay, leads Harris by 27 points, 61-34%, among those who say the country's best days are behind it. Harris, with her more optimistic messaging, leads Trump by 28 points, 63-35%, among those who think America's best days are ahead.Taken another way, 59% of Trump's supporters say the country's best days are behind it. Among Harris supporters, 67% say the country's best days are still to come.Trump leads Harris by 8 points overall in trust to handle the economy and 7 points on inflation, consistent results since August that are central to his competitiveness and reflect Harris' challenges breaking free from dissatisfaction with Biden's economic stewardship. (See more on this in Friday's report on Harris' headwinds as an agent of change.)That said, Harris pushes back on another economic benchmark, \"looking out for the middle class.\" A new item in this poll, she leads Trump on it by 5 points, 42-37%. (The rest don't trust either of them to handle it.)A test of three economic proposals from each candidate fills out the story: Trump has both the most popular and the least popular proposals, with Harris winning the second, third and fourth slots of the six.Specifically, Trump's suggestion to end income taxes on Social Security benefits leads in popularity, followed by three from Harris -- a tax credit for middle- and lower-income families with newborns, a limit on the profits food companies can make on groceries and grants to first-time home buyers. Two more Trump proposals come next -- raising tariffs on foreign imports, and the one that is unpopular among most people, cutting corporate income taxes.One of these -- the idea to end taxes on Social Security benefits -- rises to the level of majority \"strong\" support, 55%. Harris' three proposals also get more strong support than strong opposition, by 10 to 23 points. Trump's remaining items, by contrast, get much less strong support -- and cutting corporate income taxes is more apt to be strongly opposed.In trust on other issues, Trump holds single-digit leads on handling crime and safety, national security and the conflict in the Middle East; Harris has a single-digit lead on \"protecting American democracy.\" Results for items repeated from past polls are virtually unchanged.While potential voters are closely divided on many points, enthusiasm and personal favorability are two areas in which Harris has clear advantages. Among registered voters who support her, 84% say they're enthusiastic about it; among Trump supporters, enthusiasm drops by 6 points, to 78%. That's markedly lower than enthusiasm for Trump -- 93% -- at this point in 2020.Enthusiasm is related to personal favorability, and 44% of Americans see Harris favorably, vs. 35% for Trump. Harris' favorability rating lost 3 points in this poll, and 47% now see her unfavorably. That said, many more, 58%, have an unfavorable opinion of Trump.Favorability isn't determinative. Trump has been underwater in favorability consistently since 2015 -- but won the Electoral College eight years ago regardless.One important boost to Trump is that, among the 15% of registered voters who see both candidates unfavorably, he leads by a wide margin, 62-24%. Looking at it another way, 21% of Trump's supporters see him unfavorably, but support him anyway. The corresponding figure for Harris is just 7%.Trump also continues to score a few points by portraying Harris as too liberal. Forty-eight percent of Americans see her this way, vs. 43% who call Trump too conservative. That said, 7% call Harris too conservative and 9% call Trump too liberal; at the end of the day, very similar numbers call them \"about right\" ideologically, 43% for Trump, 41% for Harris.However much they're liked or disliked, another result shows that most people are ready to hear \nTrump reiterated last week that another debate is not in the cards. And there's a difference on the question between their supporters. Among registered voters who prefer Harris, 71% are looking for another debate, while among those who prefer Trump, this drops sharply, to 45%. (After their sole debate last month, 58% overall thought Harris had won it.)With the election close to three weeks away, partisanship infuses survey results. Eighty-five percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say the economy is getting worse, for instance, while just 32% of Democrats and Democratic leaners agree. In another example, Republicans and GOP leaners are far more apt than their Democratic counterparts to say the country's best days have passed, 60% vs. 36%.Policy preferences show similar patterns. Eighty-eight percent of Republicans support mass deportation, as do 58% of independents, compared with 26% of Democrats. (That said, support for deportations has increased broadly compared with a 2016 survey, with the exception of views among Democrats and liberals.)On abortion, partisan divisions results are reversed: Eighty-seven percent of Democrats say the federal government should restore abortion access, as do 57% of independents, dropping to 27% of Republicans.Polls are best used not to recite who's ahead, but to assess how and why the country is coming to its decision. It's also important to keep in mind that the ultimate winner of the popular vote may differ from the winner of the presidency, as demonstrated in 2016 and 2000 (and likewise, for history buffs, in 1888, 1876 and 1824).With Election Day drawing close and early voting underway, this poll includes slight departures from previous ABC/Ipsos polls this cycle in measuring vote preferences. Survey respondents are offered up to five candidates -- Harris, Trump, Jill Stein, Chase Oliver and Cornel West, and their running mates -- based on which of those candidates are on the ballot in the state where the respondent lives. (Robert F. Kennedy Jr., while on the ballot in 30 states and the District of Columbia, is not listed, since he's not actively running. Respondents can volunteer their support for Kennedy or anyone else.)In addition to being asked whom they'd support, respondents are given the option of saying they already voted. In this survey 1% had done so, a number likely to ramp up quickly.As mentioned, one shift in this poll is the result among men who are registered to vote -- 52-44% in Trump's favor, compared with a dead heat, 48-48%, in mid-September. That includes a 19-point Trump lead among white men and a close contest among Hispanic men and younger men (age 18-39) alike.A slight change is among independents, who, per exit polls, have voted for the winner in nine out of the last 12 presidential elections. Harris led among independents by 10 points, 51-41%, in mid-September, compared with a non-significant 5 points now, 49-44%.Harris, for her part, continues to lead among women by 9 points, 53-44%, aided by her showing among under-40, Black and Hispanic women. And she leads by 14 points among college graduates, 56-42%, among the more reliable groups for turnout.The 17-point gender gap between the candidates (Trump +8 among men, Harris +9 among women) is back to its typical level; it has averaged 19 points in exit polls since 1996. This reflects the fact that women are 8 points more apt than men to identify as Democrats.The contest stands at 82-13%, Harris-Trump, among Black people who are registered to vote; that compares with 87-12% in the 2020 exit poll (a slight 5 points lower for Harris; no better for Trump). Black women are at 87-10% now (compared with 90-9% in 2020); Black men are at 76-18% (compared with 79-19% four years ago). These differences from 2020 aren't statistically significant.Then there's the division of votes by state groupings. In what are thought to be safely and likely red states, Trump is comfortably ahead, 55-42%. In expected blue states, Harris is well ahead, 56-39%. And in the seven battleground states where the contest is expected to be close -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- it couldn't be closer: 49% for Harris, 49% for Trump.METHODOLOGY - This ABC News/Ipsos poll was conducted online via the probability-based Ipsos KnowledgePanel® Oct. 4-8, 2024, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 2,631 adults. Partisan divisions are 29-29-30%, Democrats-Republicans-independents. Results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2 percentage points, including the design effect, for the full sample. Error margins are larger for subgroups. For registered voters, the sample size is 2,226 and the error margin is 2 points. For likely voters, the sample size is 1,714 and the error margin is 2.5 points. Sampling error is not the only cause of differences in polls.The survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates, with sampling and data collection by Ipsos.

    "title": "Iowa Electronic Markets give provide foresight on elections, valuable education to students",
    "content": "DES MOINES -- Three economists and a political scientist walked into a bar, the old story goes.Shortly after, Thomas Gruca says, the Iowa Electronic Markets -- first-of-their-kind political betting markets -- were born.Gruca, a University of Iowa marketing professor, has been director of the Iowa Electronic Markets since 2020.The Iowa Electronic Markets were born at the school after that fateful meeting at a bar in 1988, when four University of Iowa professors expressed amazement at Jesse Jackson's performance in that election's Democratic presidential primary, which Gruca said the polls failed to catch.Those professors came up with the notion of something similar to financial markets.\"When you look at a stock price, if you ask economists or finance people, they say that price embeds all the information that everyone has right as of this moment about the value of that company. And if new information comes out, the stock might go up. It might go down. But right now, this is our best guess,\" Gruca said. \"So if markets can do that, why can't they do this with other important events?\"And that's where the Iowa Electronic Market idea came about.\"Nearly four decades and 10 presidential election cycles later, the Iowa Electronic Markets have become most well-known for their presidential election forecasting, and to a lesser degree its predictions on Congressional majorities.But the Iowa Electronic Markets are so much more than that, Gruca says. According to the school, the program teaches University of Iowa students business, economics and technology concepts in a hands-on, interactive environment, and increases students' economic literacy.The markets are operated by faculty at the University of Iowa Henry B. Tippie College of Business.\"It's not ever going to make any money, but we use it to train our students, a lot of them in finance,\" Gruca said. \"So it's really not just -- people see the public face every four years, but we do this all the time to train our students, mainly finance and economics.\"Broadly speaking, prediction markets allow people to bet on outcomes of future events, which thus provides a prediction of that outcome.As it pertains to politics, whereas polls survey voters about for whom they plan to vote in an election, political prediction markets allow people to bet on who they believe will win an election.That is a crucial distinction that can give prediction markets an edge in forecasting an outcome like an election, Gruca said.\"When you ask people who are you going to vote for, generally, people are answering who they want to win. They're telling you, in their heart of hearts, 'I want my candidate to win,'\" Gruca said. \"When you're in a prediction market, you don't make money by trading with your heart. You make money trading with your head.\"So you have to put that aside and say, 'OK, basically this is the person I want to win, but when my money is on the line, this is the person I think is going to win.' And that's a big difference.\"Students can invest real money -- between $5 and $500 -- and trade in a variety of contracts, including which presidential candidate will win the popular vote -- not the Electoral College, more on that later -- and which party will win a majority of seats in the U.S. House and U.S. Senate.Outside politics, students also can trade in contracts predicting a future outcome, such as an economic indicator, a company's quarterly earnings, or a corporation's stock price returns.More than 100 universities from around the world -- mostly research-oriented universities like Harvard, MIT, Michigan and Northwestern -- have enrolled in the Iowa Electronic Markets, according to the University of Iowa. And faculty members across the country use the markets in accounting, finance, macroeconomics, microeconomics, and political science courses.How is trading going on the 2024 presidential election?As of Friday, the \"Democrat will win the popular vote\" contract was selling in the Iowa Electronic Markets for 87 cents, which means traders believe there is an 87 percent chance Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris will win the popular vote.Gruca said there is not enough information for traders to aggregate to create a viable Electoral College prediction market.That means traders could buy the candidate who loses the presidential election, but their contract will still pay out if that candidate wins the popular vote -- just as it went with Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Al Gore in 2000.The Iowa Electronic Markets also conduct a separate \"vote share\" market, where traders buy and sell contracts based on the percentage of the vote that candidates will get. As of Wednesday, the Democratic candidate share was at 55 cents, meaning traders believe Harris will get 55 percent of the popular vote.There have been notable moments in previous election cycles' Iowa Electronic Markets.

The Beacon Journal editorial board has spent time sitting down with candidates to hear about their vision and priorities.More: Beacon Journal kicks off its political endorsements for this campaign seasonEndorsement: Elliot Kolkovich has earned his place as Summit County prosecutorWhen Sherri Bevan Walsh retired in January, she left behind a legacy as the county's longest-serving prosecutor who prioritized helping victims.She chose Elliot Kolkovich to continue that work, and in the approximately seven months he's been in office, he's already proved to be an effective leader with ambitious ideas.We want to see where those ideas lead.More: Elliot Kolkovich has earned his place as Summit County prosecutor | EndorsementEndorsement: Kandy Fatheree is the clear choice for Summit County sheriffAt a time when law enforcement is under intense public scrutiny, it has never been more important for a county sheriff to care for all people -- employees, offenders and the public -- while upholding the highest standard in office.These are tasks Summit County Sheriff Kandy Fatheree has managed to balance while remaining innovative and passionate about her position. In her nearly four years with the sheriff's office, Fatheree has launched several projects and initiated numerous other changes that she wants to see realized.We think Fatheree, the county's first female sheriff, deserves the chance to do so.More: OPINION: Kandy Fatheree is the clear choice for Summit County sheriff | EndorsementThe differences in Brown vs. Moreno are stark -- just look at their stancesOhio voters this year face a choice between two very different Senate candidates: A seasoned politician with a tempered approach to policy and an affinity for the working class, and a wealthy businessman from Colombia with no political experience.Here's where Senate candidates Sherrod Brown and Bernie Moreno stand on border security, gun reform, housing and bipartisanship.More: OPINION: The differences in Brown vs. Moreno are stark -- just look at their stancesThe students of Akron Public Schools deserve your support.

Emilia Sykes' seat in a heated battle to represent all of Summit County and portions of Stark and Portage counties, it's clear both have strengths they bring to the table.Our editorial board, much like the district, was split in our endorsement decision. Both candidates shared well thought-out ideas on certain policies that matter to the voters in our district.But ultimately, despite a split vote, a majority of us on the board believe Sykes is a better fit for the district.",

    "title": "Clear Winner? Donald Trump's Stunning 5-Point Lead Over Kamala Harris: 'America Is Ready for a Change!' Says Former President - EconoTimes",
    "content": "In a major boost for his 2024 presidential campaign, Donald Trump is now leading Vice President Kamala Harris by 5 points in the critical battleground state of Arizona. According to a new poll conducted by Siena Research in partnership with The New York Times, Trump is polling at 51%, while Harris trails behind at 46%. In a three-way race that includes Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Oliver Oliver, Trump maintains a solid lead, with 50% of likely voters supporting him, compared to Harris' 45%.Trump's Momentum in ArizonaArizona has emerged as a key battleground for the upcoming election, with both parties heavily focusing on the state after its decisive role in the 2020 election. Trump's lead in the latest poll suggests that the former president is successfully rallying his base and gaining ground among key voting blocs in the Grand Canyon State.The poll, which surveyed 808 likely voters from October 7 to October 10, has raised eyebrows among political analysts. Many had expected the race in Arizona to be tighter, given the state's recent trend of swinging blue. However, Trump's strong showing is likely to reignite confidence in his ability to reclaim the White House, especially in a state that was narrowly won by Joe Biden in 2020.The Harris StruggleFor Vice President Kamala Harris, these numbers present a significant challenge as she continues her bid for the presidency. Despite her historic role as the first woman of color to serve as Vice President, Harris has faced difficulty gaining traction among certain segments of the electorate. The poll indicates that she is struggling to break through with independent voters and moderates, crucial demographics in swing states like Arizona.With just over a year until the election, the Harris campaign will need to double down on efforts to connect with voters in key battlegrounds, while also addressing concerns about her leadership abilities. While her campaign has emphasized a vision of progressive policies and equity, it appears that the message has not resonated as strongly with Arizona's diverse electorate.Third-Party Candidates Not a Factor -- YetInterestingly, third-party candidates Jill Stein and Oliver Oliver have so far failed to make a dent in the race. Stein, the Green Party's candidate, holds just 1% in the poll, while Oliver, running on the Libertarian ticket, is polling at 0%. While these candidates are unlikely to have a significant impact at this stage, their presence in the race could still play spoiler roles, particularly if the race tightens in the months leading up to the election.What the Polls Mean for 2024Political strategists are closely watching Arizona as a bellwether for the 2024 election. Trump's 5-point lead is a strong indicator that his message of economic populism and his attacks on the Biden-Harris administration are resonating with voters in the state. Meanwhile, Harris will need to focus on gaining ground by addressing voter concerns on inflation, immigration, and healthcare if she hopes to close the gap.Arizona, once a reliably red state, has transformed into one of the most closely watched battlegrounds in recent years. Trump's advantage here, especially after losing the state in 2020, sends a clear message to the Harris campaign that Arizona is far from a lock for Democrats. With over a year to go until Election Day, the race remains dynamic, but for now, Trump appears to have the upper hand in this key state.",

    "title": "Republicans Now Lead in Voter Registration: 'First Time in North Carolina's History - The Democrats Are in Trouble' - EconoTimes",
    "content": "For the first time in North Carolina's presidential election history, Republicans have surpassed Democrats in active voter registration. According to data shared by political analyst Michael Pruser, the Republican Party has achieved a historic milestone in a battleground state known for its fierce electoral battles.This shift in voter demographics signals a changing tide in North Carolina politics, with profound implications for both parties as the 2024 presidential election looms. The state, which has often swung between Republican and Democratic candidates, now has more registered Republicans than Democrats for the first time ever.Republicans Surge Ahead in North CarolinaAccording to the latest data, the number of registered Republicans in North Carolina has overtaken that of registered Democrats. This development has caused a stir, as the state has long been viewed as a key battleground in presidential elections, often deciding the outcome of close races.Michael Pruser, a respected political strategist and data analyst, revealed the numbers on social media, which quickly gained traction. The shift has been attributed to several factors, including demographic changes, voter registration drives, and a growing dissatisfaction with the policies of the Biden administration.What This Means for 2024North Carolina's shift in voter registration is a significant win for the Republican Party, which has been working aggressively to mobilize voters ahead of the 2024 election. In recent years, the state has become increasingly competitive, with Donald Trump narrowly winning the state in both 2016 and 2020.This new data could suggest that Republicans are poised to build on their past victories, potentially creating a much more challenging environment for the Democratic Party, especially for candidates like President Joe Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris, who are eyeing the White House in 2024.Political experts note that this registration shift doesn't necessarily guarantee an automatic win for Republicans, as many other factors, including voter turnout and campaign strategy, will play a critical role in determining the election's outcome. However, it gives Republicans a crucial edge as the election season heats up.Democrats on the DefensiveThe news has sent shockwaves through Democratic circles. North Carolina has historically been a state where Democrats could rely on strong urban turnout to offset rural Republican voters. The Democratic Party will now have to re-evaluate its strategy as the numbers indicate they can no longer count on a registration advantage.\"This is a wake-up call for Democrats in North Carolina,\" said a Democratic Party strategist who asked to remain anonymous. \"We've got work to do if we want to maintain our competitive edge in 2024.\"Republican MomentumFor Republicans, this shift is a major win, and they are keen to maintain the momentum. The party has invested heavily in grassroots efforts, including door-to-door voter registration drives, which appear to be paying off. Republican leaders are already touting this milestone as a sign of broader political change in the country, pointing to North Carolina as a bellwether for the national mood.\"The numbers don't lie. North Carolina is turning redder by the day,\" one Republican campaign adviser stated.As both parties gear up for what is expected to be one of the most consequential elections in recent history, North Carolina's voter registration shift will likely be a critical factor in how campaigns are shaped and fought.",

    "title": "'Evangelicals for Harris' Goes to War With Franklin Graham",
    "content": "While giving a sermon in 1988, the Rev. Billy Graham, a renowned Christian evangelist, recalled a passage from the Bible that he let a man sitting next to him on a plane read.\"But you must realize that in the last days, the times will be full of danger. Men will become utterly self-centered and greedy for money,\" he said, quoting the passage.Men \"will be proud and abusive\" and \"treacherous, reckless and arrogant, loving what gives them pleasure instead of loving God,\" he added. \"They will maintain a facade of religion, but their lives deny the truth. Keep clear of people like that.\"Clips from that sermon were intercut with comments made by former President Donald Trump over the years in an ad released by Evangelicals for Harris, a group supporting Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential race against Trump.\"My whole life I've been greedy, greedy, greedy,\" Trump says in one of the clips used in the ad. \"I've grabbed all the money I could get.\" In others, he describes himself as \"the chosen one,\" talks about wanting to \"punch\" someone in the face and boasts about kissing women without permission.The \"Keep Clear\" ad is part of Evangelicals for Harris' $1 million campaign to reach evangelical voters in crucial swing states and convince them to turn out for Harris in November instead of Trump or not voting at all.But the Rev. Franklin Graham, the president and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and a longtime Trump supporter, has taken issue with the group's use of footage of his late father.\"The liberals are using anything and everything they can to promote candidate Harris,\" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter, in August.\"They are trying to mislead people. Maybe they don't know that my father appreciated the conservative values and policies of President @realDonaldTrump in 2016, and if he were alive today, my father's views and opinions would not have changed.\" Graham died in 2018 at the age of 99.Evangelicals for Harris says it has now received multiple letters, which Newsweek reviewed, from lawyers representing Franklin Graham and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) that demanded they cease using the footage.The association acknowledged in a statement to Newsweek that it has \"communicated directly\" with Evangelicals for Harris about \"the unauthorized, political use of BGEA's The statement added: \"It may be worth noting that in all of his years of ministry and across relationships with 11 U.S. presidents, Billy Graham sought only to encourage them and to offer them the counsel of Jesus Christ, as revealed through God's Word. He never criticized presidents publicly and would undoubtedly refuse to let his sermons be used to do so, regardless of who is involved.\"Evangelicals for Harris issued a statement this week, saying that Franklin Graham has \"turned to a page in the Trump playbook and is trying to silence us with threats of a long and costly court process.\"Franklin is scared of our ads because we do not tell people what to do or think. We merely hold Trump's own words up to the light of Scripture, the necessity of repentance, and Biblical warnings against leaders exactly like Trump.\"The group also shared a letter that its lawyers sent to the BGEA which asserts that the \"limited\" use of footage from Graham's 1988 sermon is protected under the fair use protections afforded by Section 107 of the \"Our ability to publicly discuss the moral failings of Donald Trump and how his behavior comports with the values espoused by evangelical leaders, including Billy Graham, is essential First Amendment expression,\" the letter said.The Rev. Jim Ball, chair of Evangelicals for Harris, told Newsweek that the footage of Graham -- whom he said was a personal hero of his -- was used because \"we feel voters need his biblical wisdom now more than ever as they decide who to vote for.\"While white evangelical voters overwhelmingly back Trump -- about 8 in 10 cast a ballot for him in 2020 and a similar share did so in 2016 -- not all evangelicals are a lockstep with the GOP. In a close contest where the outcome is expected to hinge on small margins in battleground states this year, Ball said the group is being strategic about the evangelical voters it is targeting.\"Our efforts in both 2020 and 2024 are focused on winning enough evangelicals in target states to help achieve victory,\" he said.Trump, meanwhile, has urged evangelicals to rally behind him once again in November, portraying himself as a champion of conservative Christian values and touting his appointment of U.S. Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v Wade, ending the constitutional right to abortion.\"What we see here is an ongoing struggle to define what matters most for evangelicals in voting -- is it economic conservatism, definitions of what the family and gender are, and religious freedom, or is it a move toward more economic liberalism, a focus on the marginalized, and individual freedom?\" Michael Emerson, a fellow in religion and public policy at Rice University and author of Divided by Faith: Evangelical Religion, told Newsweek.\"The struggle is partly because of our two-party system, forcing voters to make compromising choices and forcing certain issues to take precedence over others as neither party holds all evangelical positions.\"Richard Flory, executive director of the Center for Religion and Civic Culture at the University of Southern California, said Evangelicals for Harris using footage of Graham in their ad is \"a political marketing technique to sway evangelical voters, but they are trying to put lipstick on the pig of evangelical political efforts.He pointed to Graham's lifelong connection to Republicans.\"For example, Graham famously supported  Nixon -- the only other Republican presidential candidate  who received over 80 percent of the evangelical vote,\" Flory said.Evangelicals \"are predominantly conservative, even reactionary in their politics, and most, regardless the efforts of groups like Evangelicals for Harris, will still vote for Trump,\" he said. \"So, if they are using Billy Graham as an exemplar of their claim that true Christian values are represented in Democratic policies and principles, they are choosing the wrong person.\"He said he doubted the group would have \"widespread impact within evangelicalism, but it may have some success with evangelicals who do not want to be associated with Trump and thus pick up enough votes for Harris to make a difference in the election.\"Others were more skeptical that the group could sway enough evangelical voters toward Harris.\"Frankly, I don't think Evangelicals for Harris is going to have much an effect on the 2024 presidential election,\" John Fea, a professor of history at Messiah University in Pennsylvania and author of Believe Me: The Evangelical Road to Donald Trump, told Newsweek.The group \"will pull very few white evangelical voters away from Trump,\" Fea said. \"Franklin Graham has very little sway over white evangelicals who will vote for Harris in November. He lost their trust and confidence, if he ever had it, in 2016 and 2020.\"What could make a difference, Fea said, is if the Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, give white evangelicals a reason to vote for them.\"A lot of white evangelicals are disgusted by Trump and looking for any reason not to vote for him,\" Fea said, adding that Harris and Walz have not given them one.\"The GOP/evangelical alliance appears unbreakable, even with the manifest moral character and policy problems of Donald Trump,\" David Gushee, a professor of Christian ethics at Mercer University, told Newsweek.\"This is, in my view, most unfortunate. Christians should have much more independence of judgment and clearer discernment than this. In my view, it is good that there are evangelicals who are quite clear about Trump and who stand for a very different kind of politics.\"Ball is confident that Evangelicals for Harris' efforts will have an impact in November. He said the group saw success in 2020, when it was known as Evangelicals for Biden. Biden won about 2 in 10 white evangelical voters in 2020, and about one-third of evangelicals overall, according to AP VoteCast.Harris \"aligns with our biblical values of loving our neighbors as ourselves and protecting the most vulnerable as we are called to do by Jesus,\" while Trump \"uses fear and hate to divide and conquer,\" Ball said.\"The bottom line: Character still counts. Harris will do what's best for the country even if it costs her, whereas Mr. Trump will always do what's best for him, even if it hurts the country.\"",

    "content": "Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money and a financial pundit known for his bold, and sometimes inaccurate, predictions, has thrown another controversial opinion into the political arena. In a recent segment, Cramer confidently stated that he doesn't see a path for former President Donald Trump to win the 2024 presidential election. This declaration has sparked widespread debate and left many questioning whether this prediction will hold water, given Cramer's track record with forecasts.Cramer Predicts Trump's DefeatCramer, a prominent voice in finance, didn't mince words when discussing Trump's chances in 2024 during his show on CNBC. \"I don't see how he wins,\" he boldly proclaimed. While Cramer's expertise usually focuses on stock markets and the economy, his foray into political predictions has drawn attention, especially considering his history of famously inaccurate calls in the financial world.The financial guru backed up his claim by citing what he sees as growing public fatigue with Trump's style of leadership and the controversies surrounding his previous presidency. He pointed to polling data and what he described as \"shifting voter sentiment\" as reasons for his bold stance.Track Record of MissesCritics were quick to remind viewers of Cramer's past misfires in predicting trends, especially in the stock market. His declaration that Bear Stearns was \"fine\" just days before its collapse in 2008 is still fresh in many minds. Social media quickly exploded with users mocking his latest prediction, with one user tweeting, \"If Cramer says Trump will lose, you can bet he'll win by a landslide!\"Despite his reputation for sometimes missing the mark, Cramer defended his prediction, saying that it was based on data he finds compelling, particularly concerning Trump's unfavorability ratings. \"The numbers don't lie,\" he insisted.Political RamificationsTrump's supporters were quick to dismiss Cramer's analysis, arguing that the host is out of touch with the Republican base. They pointed to Trump's enduring popularity at rallies and his strong influence within the GOP as reasons why Cramer's prediction would not hold up. Several political commentators also weighed in, questioning whether Cramer's opinion on Trump should carry much weight, given his expertise in finance rather than politics.On the other hand, some Democrats and Trump critics eagerly seized on Cramer's statement, suggesting that it reflects broader sentiments about Trump's declining electability. \"When even Jim Cramer, of all people, is predicting a loss, you know Trump's in trouble,\" one commentator quipped.A Risky Bet?As the 2024 election approaches, political pundits and voters alike will undoubtedly watch closely to see whether Cramer's prediction turns out to be yet another infamous miss or a rare accurate call. Trump, known for defying the odds and prevailing in situations where many counted him out, has not responded to Cramer's latest comments.However, Trump has maintained his usual confidence, continuing his rallies and declaring that he is the only candidate who can restore America's greatness. Whether Cramer's words will prove prophetic or fall flat remains to be seen.",

    "title": "Medal of Honor Recipients Endorse Donald Trump: 'He's the Leader America Desperately Needs' - EconoTimes",
    "content": "In a powerful show of support, fifteen Medal of Honor recipients have officially endorsed Donald Trump for the 2024 presidential election. These decorated veterans, who represent some of the highest honors in the military, sent a letter highlighting their belief in Trump's leadership and vision for the future of America. This rare endorsement by such a prestigious group adds to the growing political momentum for the former president as he seeks a return to the White House.Heroes Rally Behind TrumpThe letter, signed by Medal of Honor recipients from various branches of the military, praises Trump's commitment to the country's armed forces and his unwavering dedication to national security during his time in office. They expressed confidence that Trump is the right leader to tackle the challenges facing America today.\"We've seen firsthand what it takes to defend freedom,\" the letter states. \"President Trump has shown the same unwavering resolve and patriotism in his leadership. He's the leader America desperately needs right now.\"The Medal of Honor recipients pointed to Trump's military policies, including the rebuilding of the U.S. armed forces and his efforts to strengthen veterans' benefits. Many praised his push for higher defense budgets and his aggressive foreign policy stances, which they believe made the country safer during his presidency.A Call to Action for Veterans and PatriotsIn their letter, the honorees encouraged their fellow veterans and patriots across the country to join them in supporting Trump's 2024 bid, emphasizing the need for a strong leader who values America's military and is willing to make tough decisions in the nation's best interest.\"Donald Trump stood up for the military like no other president before him,\" one recipient said in an interview with Military Times. \"He fought to make sure we had the tools to succeed, and he cared about those who served.\"The letter also highlighted Trump's historic efforts in securing peace deals in the Middle East, his decisive actions against terrorism, and his administration's tough stance against foreign adversaries like China and Iran.Trump Responds to the EndorsementFollowing the release of the letter, Trump expressed his gratitude to the Medal of Honor recipients, calling their endorsement an \"incredible honor.\" He took to his social media platform to thank the veterans for their service and support.\"These great heroes understand what it takes to protect America, and I am truly humbled by their endorsement,\" Trump said. \"Together, we will restore our country's greatness and keep it safe for future generations.\"Controversy Surrounds the EndorsementDespite the high praise from the Medal of Honor recipients, Trump's endorsement by military figures has not been without controversy. Critics point to instances during his presidency when he faced backlash for his remarks about military leaders and veterans, including a reported incident where he allegedly referred to fallen soldiers as \"losers\" and \"suckers\" -- a claim he vehemently denied.Nevertheless, the Medal of Honor recipients' endorsement is a significant boost to Trump's campaign, signaling continued support from a critical voting bloc -- veterans and military families. As the 2024 race heats up, Trump is expected to leverage this endorsement to strengthen his appeal to voters who prioritize national security and military strength.",

    "title": "'Evangelicals for Harris' goes to war with Franklin Graham",
    "content": "While giving a sermon in 1988, the Rev. Billy Graham, a renowned Christian evangelist, recalled a passage from the Bible that he let a man sitting next to him on a plane read.\"But you must realize that in the last days, the times will be full of danger. Men will become utterly self-centered and greedy for money,\" he said, quoting the passage.Men \"will be proud and abusive\" and \"treacherous, reckless and arrogant, loving what gives them pleasure instead of loving God,\" he added. \"They will maintain a facade of religion, but their lives deny the truth. Keep clear of people like that.\"Clips from that sermon were intercut with comments made by former President Donald Trump over the years in an ad released by Evangelicals for Harris, a group supporting Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential race against Trump.\"My whole life I've been greedy, greedy, greedy,\" Trump says in one of the clips used in the ad. \"I've grabbed all the money I could get.\" In others, he describes himself as \"the chosen one,\" talks about wanting to \"punch\" someone in the face and boasts about kissing women without permission.The \"Keep Clear\" ad is part of Evangelicals for Harris' $1 million campaign to reach evangelical voters in crucial swing states and convince them to turn out for Harris in November instead of Trump or not voting at all.But the Rev. Franklin Graham, the president and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and a longtime Trump supporter, has taken issue with the group's use of footage of his late father.\"The liberals are using anything and everything they can to promote candidate Harris,\" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter, in August.\"They are trying to mislead people. Maybe they don't know that my father appreciated the conservative values and policies of President @realDonaldTrump in 2016, and if he were alive today, my father's views and opinions would not have changed.\" Graham died in 2018 at the age of 99.Evangelicals for Harris says it has now received multiple letters, which Newsweek reviewed, from lawyers representing Franklin Graham and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) that demanded they cease using the footage.The association acknowledged in a statement to Newsweek that it has \"communicated directly\" with Evangelicals for Harris about \"the unauthorized, political use of BGEA's The statement added: \"It may be worth noting that in all of his years of ministry and across relationships with 11 U.S. presidents, Billy Graham sought only to encourage them and to offer them the counsel of Jesus Christ, as revealed through God's Word. He never criticized presidents publicly and would undoubtedly refuse to let his sermons be used to do so, regardless of who is involved.\"Evangelicals for Harris issued a statement this week, saying that Franklin Graham has \"turned to a page in the Trump playbook and is trying to silence us with threats of a long and costly court process.\"Franklin is scared of our ads because we do not tell people what to do or think. We merely hold Trump's own words up to the light of Scripture, the necessity of repentance, and Biblical warnings against leaders exactly like Trump.\"The group also shared a letter that its lawyers sent to the BGEA which asserts that the \"limited\" use of footage from Graham's 1988 sermon is protected under the fair use protections afforded by Section 107 of the \"Our ability to publicly discuss the moral failings of Donald Trump and how his behavior comports with the values espoused by evangelical leaders, including Billy Graham, is essential First Amendment expression,\" the letter said.The Rev. Jim Ball, chair of Evangelicals for Harris, told Newsweek that the footage of Graham -- whom he said was a personal hero of his -- was used because \"we feel voters need his biblical wisdom now more than ever as they decide who to vote for.\"While white evangelical voters overwhelmingly back Trump -- about 8 in 10 cast a ballot for him in 2020 and a similar share did so in 2016 -- not all evangelicals are a lockstep with the GOP. In a close contest where the outcome is expected to hinge on small margins in battleground states this year, Ball said the group is being strategic about the evangelical voters it is targeting.\"Our efforts in both 2020 and 2024 are focused on winning enough evangelicals in target states to help achieve victory,\" he said.Trump, meanwhile, has urged evangelicals to rally behind him once again in November, portraying himself as a champion of conservative Christian values and touting his appointment of U.S. Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v Wade, ending the constitutional right to abortion.\"What we see here is an ongoing struggle to define what matters most for evangelicals in voting -- is it economic conservatism, definitions of what the family and gender are, and religious freedom, or is it a move toward more economic liberalism, a focus on the marginalized, and individual freedom?\" Michael Emerson, a fellow in religion and public policy at Rice University and author of Divided by Faith: Evangelical Religion, told Newsweek.\"The struggle is partly because of our two-party system, forcing voters to make compromising choices and forcing certain issues to take precedence over others as neither party holds all evangelical positions.\"Richard Flory, executive director of the Center for Religion and Civic Culture at the University of Southern California, said Evangelicals for Harris using footage of Graham in their ad is \"a political marketing technique to sway evangelical voters, but they are trying to put lipstick on the pig of evangelical political efforts.He pointed to Graham's lifelong connection to Republicans.\"For example, Graham famously supported  Nixon -- the only other Republican presidential candidate  who received over 80 percent of the evangelical vote,\" Flory said.Evangelicals \"are predominantly conservative, even reactionary in their politics, and most, regardless the efforts of groups like Evangelicals for Harris, will still vote for Trump,\" he said. \"So, if they are using Billy Graham as an exemplar of their claim that true Christian values are represented in Democratic policies and principles, they are choosing the wrong person.\"He said he doubted the group would have \"widespread impact within evangelicalism, but it may have some success with evangelicals who do not want to be associated with Trump and thus pick up enough votes for Harris to make a difference in the election.\"Others were more skeptical that the group could sway enough evangelical voters toward Harris.\"Frankly, I don't think Evangelicals for Harris is going to have much an effect on the 2024 presidential election,\" John Fea, a professor of history at Messiah University in Pennsylvania and author of Believe Me: The Evangelical Road to Donald Trump, told Newsweek.The group \"will pull very few white evangelical voters away from Trump,\" Fea said. \"Franklin Graham has very little sway over white evangelicals who will vote for Harris in November. He lost their trust and confidence, if he ever had it, in 2016 and 2020.\"What could make a difference, Fea said, is if the Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, give white evangelicals a reason to vote for them.\"A lot of white evangelicals are disgusted by Trump and looking for any reason not to vote for him,\" Fea said, adding that Harris and Walz have not given them one.\"The GOP/evangelical alliance appears unbreakable, even with the manifest moral character and policy problems of Donald Trump,\" David Gushee, a professor of Christian ethics at Mercer University, told Newsweek.\"This is, in my view, most unfortunate. Christians should have much more independence of judgment and clearer discernment than this. In my view, it is good that there are evangelicals who are quite clear about Trump and who stand for a very different kind of politics.\"Ball is confident that Evangelicals for Harris' efforts will have an impact in November. He said the group saw success in 2020, when it was known as Evangelicals for Biden. Biden won about 2 in 10 white evangelical voters in 2020, and about one-third of evangelicals overall, according to AP VoteCast.Harris \"aligns with our biblical values of loving our neighbors as ourselves and protecting the most vulnerable as we are called to do by Jesus,\" while Trump \"uses fear and hate to divide and conquer,\" Ball said.\"The bottom line: Character still counts. Harris will do what's best for the country even if it costs her, whereas Mr. Trump will always do what's best for him, even if it hurts the country.\"",

    "title": "5 big analyst AI moves: Microsoft, Amazon rating cuts; Robotaxi day disappoints By Investing.com",
    "content": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!Microsoft downgraded at OppenheimerOppenheimer analysts downgraded Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock from Outperform to Perform on Tuesday, citing concerns about elevated consensus expectations for both revenue and earnings.A key issue raised by the firm's analysts is potential losses stemming from Microsoft's AI partner, OpenAI, which is expected to post a loss of around $5 billion this year. With Microsoft holding a 49% stake, the company could face significant financial impact as a result.The downgrade also highlighted slower-than-expected enterprise adoption of AI technologies, which could lead to lower-than-anticipated revenue from AI-related services.In addition, Oppenheimer pointed to rising capital expenditures (CapEx), particularly in high-performance computing, such as GPUs and data centers. The firm estimates that Microsoft's CapEx will hit $63 billion by 2025, a 14% year-over-year increase and double what it spent in 2023. Depreciation is also expected to rise by 28%, reaching $29 billion.The analysts mentioned that the Federal Reserve's 50 basis point interest rate cut in September, will likely have a modest effect on Microsoft's net interest income from its $76 billion cash reserve.Oppenheimer also expressed concerns over Microsoft's gross and EBITDA margins, which are expected to decline due to rising depreciation and operational costs linked to AI investments.\"This will translate into 3% EPS growth in 1Q25 and we expect weakish guidance for 2025. We also think the Street estimates for EPS growth are ~200bps too high in FY26 and FY27,\" analysts said in a note.Further risks include potential bottlenecks in data center capacity to meet anticipated GPU shipments and growing competition in the AI space, with other companies narrowing the gap on Microsoft.Microsoft's stock currently trades in the middle of its five-year price-to-earnings range of 25x-35x, though Oppenheimer suggests it could drift toward the lower end of that spectrum.Goldman hikes Nvidia price target after meeting with leadershipGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) raised its price target for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to $150 from $135 on Friday, reflecting an 11% potential upside.Following a recent investor meeting with Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang, CFO Colette Kress, and IR representative Stewart Stecker, Goldman Sachs analysts expressed stronger confidence in Nvidia's competitive positioning, particularly as inference workloads become more complex.\"We came away from the NDR with a better appreciation of the company's competitive moat and, importantly, the projected increase in Inference workload complexity as well as its implications for future compute demand,\" the bank noted.Goldman Sachs highlighted several factors underpinning Nvidia's competitive advantage, including its large installed base, innovation at both the chip and data center levels, and its expanding software offerings.The report specifically mentioned domain-specific libraries like Nvidia Parabricks, used for genomics analysis, and Nvidia AI Aerial, which supports cloud-native 5G networks.The firm also raised its revenue and non-GAAP EPS estimates for FY2026/27 by 7% and 8%, respectively. This adjustment reflects higher cloud capex, strong AI server orders, and an improved outlook for chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) at TSMC.Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) cuts Amazon rating, price targetWells Fargo cut Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock rating to Equal Weight from Overweight earlier in the week, pointing out several challenges that could halt the company's positive earnings revision momentum.The bank also reduced its price target for Amazon to $183 from $225.Although Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains a strong performer, Wells Fargo stated it is \"not enough\" to drive upward estimate revisions in the near term.Key concerns include Amazon's investments in Project Kuiper, pressure from Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) fees, and slowing growth from its advertising business.The firm also warned that \"margin expansion could be capped in 1H25 as well\" and suggested that positive revisions may not return until Amazon issues guidance in July 2025.\"While the market is more prepared for pressure on 4Q OI, we caution that margin expansion could be capped in 1H25 as well. As such, we move to Equal Weight until visibility into margin expansion resumes,\" Wells Fargo's team wrote.Moreover, Wells Fargo cut its operating income (OI) estimates for Amazon by $5.4 billion, $4.5 billion, and $5.5 billion for 2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively, attributing the reductions to slower monetization of its merchant services and advertising businesses.\"Amazon remains a margin expansion story,\" according to the bank, but it noted that the rate of this expansion will likely be slower than what the market currently anticipates.The note also highlighted rising competition from Walmart (NYSE:WMT), which has priced its fulfillment services 15% lower than Amazon's FBA, adding pressure to Amazon's market share.Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) disappointed with Robotaxi eventMorgan Stanley analysts voiced disappointment following Tesla's much-anticipated \"We, Robot\" event this week, citing a lack of key information about Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology, ride-sharing economics, and a clear go-to-market strategy for autonomous vehicles.Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares dropped nearly 9% Friday, as several analysts pointed to the absence of detailed updates during the event.Tesla did reveal its upcoming \"Cybercab,\" but Morgan Stanley remarked that the presentation lacked meaningful new insights. \"We were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation,\" analysts said in a note.Ahead of the event, Morgan Stanley had anticipated significant updates on Tesla's FSD technology, such as measurable improvements in miles driven without disengagements, but these specifics were not provided.The Wall Street firm also expected details on the strategy behind the company's supervised and unsupervised ride-sharing services, including economic analysis and estimates for the total addressable market (TAM).\"We had expected at least some incremental information around the 'rate of change' of the FSD system,\" it explained.Furthermore, the event did not provide any meaningful discussion on Tesla's collaboration with xAI or updates on Tesla's \"Master Plan 4,\" leaving Morgan Stanley analysts to conclude that the event failed to significantly move forward Tesla's narrative as an AI-focused company.Geopolitical tensions could 'prick the AI bubble'Capital Economics warned in a Friday note that escalating trade disputes between the US and China, or a sharp rise in tensions between China and Taiwan, represent significant geopolitical risks that could \"prick the AI bubble.\"While tech stocks have seen strong performance this year, the firm cautioned that the rally could stall as geopolitical risks intensify, especially with the US presidential election approaching.A central concern is Taiwan's critical role in the AI supply chain. Taiwanese companies control around 90% of the market for advanced chips and AI servers, key drivers of the AI capital expenditure boom among major tech firms.According to Capital Economics, any disruption in this supply chain due to geopolitical conflict could have severe consequences.\"China could restrict the flow of highly advanced semiconductor chips and AI servers from Taiwan to the US, thereby breaking the 'AI supply chain,'\" the firm emphasized in a note.On the US-China trade front, the report points to potential risks of heightened tensions after the 2024 US presidential election.If Donald Trump returns to office, strategists anticipate \"a significant increase in tariffs on Chinese goods\" and a broader shift away from free trade, which would raise costs for tech companies. Even under a Harris administration, which is expected to maintain current export controls, there is still considerable risk to the tech sector.",

    "title": "5 big analyst AI moves: Microsoft, Amazon rating cuts; Robotaxi day disappoints By Investing.com",
    "content": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!Oppenheimer analysts downgraded Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock from Outperform to Perform on Tuesday, citing concerns about elevated consensus expectations for both revenue and earnings.A key issue raised by the firm's analysts is potential losses stemming from Microsoft's AI partner, OpenAI, which is expected to post a loss of around $5 billion this year. With Microsoft holding a 49% stake, the company could face significant financial impact as a result.The downgrade also highlighted slower-than-expected enterprise adoption of AI technologies, which could lead to lower-than-anticipated revenue from AI-related services.In addition, Oppenheimer pointed to rising capital expenditures (CapEx), particularly in high-performance computing, such as GPUs and data centers. The firm estimates that Microsoft's CapEx will hit $63 billion by 2025, a 14% year-over-year increase and double what it spent in 2023. Depreciation is also expected to rise by 28%, reaching $29 billion.The analysts mentioned that the Federal Reserve's 50 basis point interest rate cut in September, will likely have a modest effect on Microsoft's net interest income from its $76 billion cash reserve.Oppenheimer also expressed concerns over Microsoft's gross and EBITDA margins, which are expected to decline due to rising depreciation and operational costs linked to AI investments.\"This will translate into 3% EPS growth in 1Q25 and we expect weakish guidance for 2025. We also think the Street estimates for EPS growth are ~200bps too high in FY26 and FY27,\" analysts said in a note.Further risks include potential bottlenecks in data center capacity to meet anticipated GPU shipments and growing competition in the AI space, with other companies narrowing the gap on Microsoft.Microsoft's stock currently trades in the middle of its five-year price-to-earnings range of 25x-35x, though Oppenheimer suggests it could drift toward the lower end of that spectrum.Goldman Sachs raised its price target for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to $150 from $135 on Friday, reflecting an 11% potential upside.Following a recent investor meeting with Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang, CFO Colette Kress, and IR representative Stewart Stecker, Goldman Sachs analysts expressed stronger confidence in Nvidia's competitive positioning, particularly as inference workloads become more complex.\"We came away from the NDR with a better appreciation of the company's competitive moat and, importantly, the projected increase in Inference workload complexity as well as its implications for future compute demand,\" the bank noted.Goldman Sachs highlighted several factors underpinning Nvidia's competitive advantage, including its large installed base, innovation at both the chip and data center levels, and its expanding software offerings.The report specifically mentioned domain-specific libraries like Nvidia Parabricks, used for genomics analysis, and Nvidia AI Aerial, which supports cloud-native 5G networks.The firm also raised its revenue and non-GAAP EPS estimates for FY2026/27 by 7% and 8%, respectively.

    "title": "Actor Dennis Quaid joins Trump at Coachella rally",
    "content": "COACHELLA - Veteran actor Dennis Quaid joined former President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump Saturday at a rally in Coachella, California, known for being the home of the famed music festival.Quaid, who recently starred in the biopic \"Reagan,\" told Trump supporters that the 2024 presidential election is between TikTok and the US Constitution.\"I'm here to tell you that it's time to pick a side,\" said Quaid. \"Are we going to be a nation that stands for the Constitution or for TikTok?\"Quaid, the ex-husband of actress Meg Ryan, is known for his roles in films like \"The Parent Trap\" and \"Dragonheart.\" He endorsed Trump in early September during his press tour for his movie \"Reagan.\"Trump took the stage around 5:30 p.m. Saturday. Soon into his speech, he complained about the heat, as the temperature was nearly 100 degrees. He then took a poll to determine if he should put on a hat -- his signature red \"Make America Great Again\" ball cap -- which he ultimately did.He also complained about being called weird. He referred to his term in office, which included the COVID-19 pandemic, as the \"greatest four years in our country's history.\"Although he said he was told the economy was the most important issue, he said he considers the border the number-one issue.Among the false claims he made was that Harris supported \"an army of illegal alien criminals,\" and that she \"imported criminal gangs\" into the country.\"If Kamala gets four more years, the country will become like the migrant camp of San Francisco and L.A.,\" Trump said. \"Kamala's turning us into a third-world nation.\"He alleged that a study was taken a few years ago found that 1 in 4 students in Los Angeles County was from a family headed by someone here illegally, and that the number was much higher today.Among his promises, he said, \"On day one, I will close the border and stop the invasion.\" He also said he would end sanctuary cities, support universal school choice and cut energy prices in half in his first year back in office. \"We're gonna frack, frack, frack.\"\"We will secure our elections like they've never been secured before,\" he said.He threatened to withhold financial aid for California forest fires as a bargaining chip in advancing his political agenda.He also pointed to the press and said, \"That is a lot of fake news,\" inciting the crowd to stand and give reporters thumbs down.At one point, Trump had to pause while someone suffered some type of medical emergency. He called for a doctor to respond.At 6:52 p.m., he stopped speaking, then danced to \"YMCA\" before leaving the stage.Trump rarely makes appearances in Democrat-heavy California, mainly attending private fundraisers. Polling data amalgamated by FiveThirtyEight suggests that he trails Harris in the state by approximately 25 percentage points.One Harris campaign staffer, Ammar Moussa, scoffed on X about Trump's planned Saturday rally, writing, \"Oh no. This is extremely concerning for our campaign. Please do not go to Coachella, CALIFORNIA, 24 days before the election.\"Coachella Mayor Steven Hernandez released a statement Monday afternoon unfavorably comparing Trump's planned rally to a 2020 primary campaign event held by Sen. Bernie Sanders, whom he said the city was \"proud to welcome.\"\"Trump's attacks on immigrants, women, the LQBTQ community and the most vulnerable among us don't align with the values of our community,\" Hernandez said. \"He has consistently expressed disdain for the type of diversity that helps define Coachella. We don't know why Trump is visiting near Coachella, but we know he wasn't invited by the people who live here. He ain't like us.\"Rep. Raul Ruiz, D-Indio, whose district includes the rally site, echoed Hernandez's sentiment in another statement Monday, calling the rally \"yet another demonstration of his cluelessness and ignorance\" and Trump himself \"an affront to everything that makes the Coachella Valley a vibrant community.\" (With CNS report)Want stories like this delivered straight to your inbox?

    "title": "The sheer absurdity of Donald Trump",
    "content": "With just weeks to go in this election, Palmer Report is leading the charge in fighting and winning. We've been at this for nearly a decade. You know our track record. Help us get across the finish line: Sure I'll help!It's not just that Donald Trump is jealous of former President Obama. I believe Donald Trump would like to BE Obama. Obama is everything Trump will never be. Yes, his envy burns bright, but there's more to it than that. Obama is a winner, something Donald John Trump always wanted to be but could never achieve. So that sticks in his craw and makes him absolutely crazy.That might be why a senile and insane Trump is saying Obama will vote for him in the 2024 presidential election. That's right. Donald Trump has warmly welcomed this delusion and told it to have a seat and to stay a while.Trump, on Truth social, claimed that Obama dislikes Kamala Harris's low IQ and will be voting for his royal criminal. \"I think Obama will be voting for me,\" the felon declared. To trace the origin of Trump's antipathy for Obama, one needs to look no further than that historical White House correspondent's dinner, where Obama mercilessly mocked a furious Donald Trump.That was likely a powder keg for Trump -- being mocked by the smartest guy in the room! Such shame he must have felt, and we know that he did feel shame because Trump's got no poker face, and his thoughts are very easy to read and understand.Of course, there's also the fact that Obama is SO popular. He can easily fill a stadium with screaming, ecstatic supporters. Going to an Obama event is like going to a sold-out rock concert. The euphoria, the joy, the energy -- these are not things seen at any Trump rally, where what IS seen are hate, antipathy, and excruciating boredom. So yes. Trump made this declaration, quickly making thousands of people giggle and chortle. It would be like saying Matt Gaetz is voting for Harris. The absolute absurdity of Donald Trump is far-reaching and never-ending.",

    "content": "\"Another prophet of disaster who says this ship is lost. Another prophet of disaster leaving you to count the cost.\" -- Iron Maiden, \"Die with Your Boots On\"We're entering the closing quarter of the 2024 presidential election. Emotions are whirling; anxiety is growing; everyone's on pins and needles. We're famished for clarity -- for words of wisdom -- searching for a way to find meaning in it all.The truth is, nobody really knows who's \"winning\" right now. (And besides, \"winning\" an election before Election Day is kind of like \"winning\" the Super Bowl on the preceding Saturday: It doesn't really mean anything.) There are simply too many moving parts. Because of deaths, immigration (illegal and otherwise), COVID-related rule-changes, state-to-state migration, and more, there isn't anyone alive who can legitimately tell you who's ahead and who's behind.But that won't stop 'em from trying.There's no shortage of \"experts\" who'll tell you whatever you want to hear. Whether you're on the Left or the Right, you can find a pundit who'll tell you everything's awesome. Since the dawn of time, there's always been great social equity in claiming insights everyone else lacks, whether it's prophecy, financial knowledge, political solutions, or divine knowledge.But eventually, the chickens come home to roost.It happened in 2012. If you remember, Dick Morris and Karl Rove were all over FOX News in the run-up to the election, guaranteeing that Mitt Romney was cruising to victory. But their logic was absurd. (In fact, I was so annoyed by 'em, I wrote an essay to a FOX News producer-buddy. He forwarded it to the FOX News opinion editor, and they actually published it as a two-parter -- on the condition that I excised my criticisms of Rove and Morris, of course.)I believe the day after Mitt Romney lost marked Morris's last appearance on FOX News (Rove is still there).\"Taunting us with visions, afflicting us with fear. Predicting was for millions, in the hope that one appears.\" -- Iron Maiden, \"Die with Your Boots On\"I knew Rove and Morris were wrong because they were speaking assuredly about outcomes that were unknowable. It's not that I'm smarter; it's that I'm smart enough to know what I'm dumb at. Sometimes, the right answer is, \"I don't know.\"If you're pro-MAGA, there are ample reasons for optimism: When you track how Trump polled in various states against Clinton and Biden, we can compare it with the eventual outcomes. By many metrics, Trump is performing better in 2024 than he did in 2016 or 2020. If everything else is exactly the same, it would seem to indicate that Trump's trajectory is exactly where it needs to be.But this is a different country now.In 2016, Elon Musk was still a liberal hero, Dick and Liz Cheney were rock-solid conservatives, and everyone wanted to go to a Puff Daddy party. Artificial intelligence existed, but it couldn't hold a conversation with you. A lot has changed since then: The oldest generation of Americans -- including members of the Greatest Generation -- were replaced by Zoomers. COVID-fueled migrations have changed the voting margins in battleground states. Absentee and/or remote voting was the exception, not the rule. There wasn't a hot war in Europe; there wasn't runaway inflation; our priorities were dramatically different.But we keep demanding to know the future -- now, today. We keep searching for a modern-day Michel de Nostradamus to reveal what's to come. And speaking of Nostradamus:\"'Thirteen: The Beast is rising!' the Frenchman did surmise. Through earthquakes and starvation, the Warlord will arise.\" -- Iron Maiden, \"Die with Your Boots On\"The most honest answer any pundit can give you is this: Certain metrics favor Trump, while others lean toward Harris. An intelligent, fair-minded pollster could make a credible argument either way, and it wouldn't be malpractice. But there are too many unknowns. (Among the biggest unknowns is how motivated Democratic voters will be to support a candidate they don't know very well.)Political polling is kind of like forecasting the path of a hurricane weeks in advance: You know what's happened in the past, and you can make certain extrapolations, but more often than not, that hurricane is gonna do something surprising. Might not be right away. Could be days from now. But it almost never follows the predicted path in its entirety.And just one small, tiny wobble can change the entire trajectory.\"Terror, death, destruction pour from the Eastern sands.

    "content": "The wrath of a nation can be a fearful thing. In 2022 we saw its evolution and culmination in our own \"Aragalaya\", which sent the then president, a so called \"battle hardened\" war veteran and \"warrior-statesman\", first in to exile and then to precipitate retirement.We saw it again, just a couple of weeks ago, in the election of Sri Lanka's ninth executive president, a villager from deeply rural Tambuttegama, the son of a surveyor's assistant. That he was the first student from Tambuttegama Central College to gain university entrance, is another factor which attests to the absence of privilege and personal resources. His election is also an extension of the \"Aragalaya\", and a logical evolution of that movement, but without the drama and histrionics and, instead, that energy, that anger, legitimately channeled in to a quiet civic purpose.Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) is an unlikely incumbent in the presidential palace, not only because of his very modest background, but also because of the baggage and history of violence, against the very people and the institutions he is now going to govern, perpetrated by the political party which sponsored him. The late Ranasinghe Premadasa, too, came from the urban equivalent of social irrelevance but, by the time he became president of the country, he was already a towering force in national politics.Most of the 5.7 million people who voted AKD in to power, including this writer and his wife, had not forgotten the impact and consequences of the 1971 JVP insurrection, or those of the second in 1988/89. Given that disturbing context, why did he win the 2024 presidential election, albeit by a slim majority? AKD was a toddler during the first insurrection but has readily admitted to playing a part in the second, as a very active member.I offer my(our) voting pattern as a likely explanation.In 1977, I rode from Kandapola to Kadadorapitiya in Kotmale, a distance of 50 km in the pouring rain, with my wife on the pillion, and we voted for the UNP candidate for Kotmale. As a working tea planter then, I and many of my colleagues, were deeply disturbed by the intimidatory demonstrations of many ruling SLFP politicians, against the plantation fraternity. That was the last time we voted for a party led by J.R. Jayewardene (JRJ). In 2005, despite serious misgivings, we voted for Ranil Wickremesinghe, as I found Mahinda Rajapaksa's (MR) racially-charged rhetoric, abhorrent.In 2009 we opted for Field Marshal, Sarath Fonseka, as a more decent, uncorrupt alternative to Rajapaksa rule, though I gave MR credit for having displayed the political will, for the elimination of the LTTE threat against the Sri Lankan nation-state. In 2015, revolted by the rampant corruption and the aggressively anti-minority stance of the Rajapaksa regime, we chose Maithripala Sirisena and Yahapalanaya.I even wrote a couple of articles, extolling the virtues of the good governance that was promised. There was hope, for a few weeks, till the \"bond scam\" ordure hit the proverbial fan and dispelled the euphoria. The promise of good governance was just a cover for the swindles which followed. In 2019 we voted for Sajith Premadasa, as we were convinced, with total justification, that Gotabaya Rajapaksa would be an extension of Rajapksa misrule, despite the contrary opinion of 6.9 million people.Five years later, along with a few million others, we have placed our faith in the passionate, peasant reformer from Tambuttegama.Commencing with the JRJ regime, key features of all successive governments have been State corruption, intimidation and assassination of critics, an arrogant disregard for the judiciary which included physical intimidation, the patronage of criminals, and complicity in fraudulent transactions of massive proportions, which depleted State resources, carried out by the State itself or through empowered proxies. These rose to new heights under MR and, under GR, were further compounded by moronic presidential directives, which impoverished the nation through the loss of agricultural land productivity.The cumulative result of the above was a financial implosion, the summary eviction of GR, and the unexpected installation of Ranil Wickremesinghe (RW), as an unlikely saviour. He did restore a measure of fiscal sanity and provided the nation with some relief, but coupled it with the imposition of unbearable financial hardship on citizens, who were actually the helpless victims of the crimes of the rulers.Along with the restoration of financial order, RW's term as president was also signposted by questionable deals, of proportions which relegated the earlier \"bond scam\" in to insignificance. The Adani wind-power project, the \"Visa\" scam and the electronic passport deal, are but a few typical examples. Added to that was RW's arrogant dismissal of Supreme Court directives and his contemptuous rebuttals to legitimate queries, even in Parliament. In an article published in the \"Island\" newspaper of July 17, 2022, I suggested that RW's first acts as \"appointed president\", may be the \"preliminaries to a fascist regime to rival that of the deposed president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa\". I was not wrong.Thus, despite changes in regimes and rulers, the corrupt and the powerful continued to thrive, proving to an agonized nation that powerful men will always protect powerful men, irrespective of differences in political belief. The people and the faces changed but the status quo, the license to loot and impunity from consequences, has been inviolate.In the meantime, Sajith Premadasa (SP) despite overbearing, self-adulatory rhetoric , even in relation to the simplest of issues, when actually put to the test, twice demonstrated that he did not have the courage to venture in to unchartered territory. I voiced my feelings in two articles in the 'Island- (The River That Sajith Premadasa Did Not Cross- May 15 2022 and, The Wickremesinghe Presidency- July 27,.2022). It must have crossed SP's mind, after the latest loss, that had he seized the moment then, instead of allowing RW to grab it, he would probably be the elected president today.AKD, our new president, notwithstanding repeated rejection by the electors, has remained firmly grounded to his platform of systems reform, fearlessly naming names and exposing corruption. His campaign message was fluent, direct and simple, and it has been accepted by a reasonable majority (42%) of those who voted, representing an exponential, hardly credible, increase from the paltry 3.16% in the 2019 presidential election.Patali Ranawaka, parliamentarian, along with many other detractors, has sought to belittle this achievement, suggesting that AKD has been rejected by 58% of the voters. This simplistic arithmetic, if applied to the other two contestants, would suggest that SP has been rejected by 68% and RW by 83%, the latter despite his repeated claims, of having ferried the infant Sri Lankan nation across troubled waters.Namal Rajapaksa's (NM) abysmal performance, was a refreshingly unequivocal message from the entire nation, that the Rajapaksa brand of Sinhala-Buddhist centred, militaristic rhetoric, was no longer a marketable product, though related issues were not given central focus during his campaign. NR, stupidly arrogant and myopic, pre-election, spoke loftily, with smug conviction, of furthering the \"Mahinda Chinthanaya\", and was rejected by 98% of the electors. RW's performance too may have been better, had he not surrounded himself with the most corrupt of the Pohottuwa regime. Conversely, the election result reinforces the proven dictum, that the unappetizing RW is a negative influence on any alliance.Overall, the 2024 election, for the first time since Independence, represents an unexpected maturity of outlook in the Sri Lankan nation. By electing the outsider from Tambuttegama, the voters have broken with the entrenched tradition of family rule, dynastic succession and old-party loyalty, along with the rejection of the tired, obsolete, ideologies of the established parties, parroted, in different ways, by both RW and SP.The anger of the voters resonated with AKD's message for a complete systems reform, an end to State corruption, and promised punishment for the corrupt and the criminal. AKD represents the last hope for a nation, nauseated, and impoverished, by the venality of its rulers. It is that message that I responded to, notwithstanding credible apprehensions about possible long-term outcomes of NPP-JVP rule.His commitment to and focus on, transparency, accountability and social justice, inequalities in health care, educational opportunities, employment creation and environmental sustainability, mirrored the aspirations and concerns of many, especially those at the middle and lower end of the socio-economic ladder. Those comprise clear and optimistic visions for the future, particularly appealing in a time of great national uncertainty. They are also issues which engage the attention of educated youth, who have been frustrated by successive governments.AKD has fared poorly in the Central Province plantation areas, and the North and the East, where the minorities are pre-dominant. He needs to quickly engage those polities, who have different needs, aspirations and agendas, all legitimate, but denied or subverted by a succession of Sinhala-Buddhist centrist governments. In this area AKD will be treading thin ice, meeting minority aspirations whilst keeping at bay two key JVP/NPP support segments - the retired military and the politically active Buddhist monks. The latter group in particular, is openly committed to Sinhala-Buddhist supremacy and the imposition of a Buddhist seal in the North and the East, engaging for their project the willing support of the forces, the Police Department and even the Department of Archaeology.Recently, on You-tube, I watched a pre-election rally addressed by AKD, held at the Tambuttegama Central School grounds. He spoke convincingly, and movingly, of the life that he, his family, his fellow villagers and his schoolmates had led. In a matter-of-fact manner, he described the deprivation, the lack of resources and opportunities , and the social and economic marginalization that had been their lot. The audience - his community - listened in pin-drop silence. It was their story as well. Through that deeply personal narrative, he was reflecting the marginal circumstances of 80% of the people of this country, especially in the rural areas. If only a fraction of his manifesto is implemented, it will make life better for that segment and to that end, he needs, and deserves, the mandate that he is seeking.",

    "content": "The 2024 presidential election will hinge on swing states, particularly Pennsylvania. However, Michigan has emerged as a critical battleground for Vice President Kamala Harris, where she's facing tough challenges among working-class, Black and Arab-American voters.Her running mate, Governor Tim Walz, was in the state Friday, appealing to working-class voters.\"Kamala Harris has helped further the resurgence of American manufacturing, especially here in Michigan,\" Walz said. \"As vice president, she invested in working people, and today there are more factories being built, more auto and construction jobs, and more American energy being produced than any day when Donald Trump was president.\"It's a voting bloc she seems to be struggling with, especially after losing out on endorsements from the International Association of Fire Fighters and Teamsters; some say this is a sign that union voters are swinging to the right.The state's large Black population could also be a problem for Harris in Michigan as polls indicate weaker support from Black men than previous Democratic candidates.\"You're thinking about sitting out or even supporting somebody who has a history of denigrating you,\" former President Barack Obama said Thursday in Pennsylvania while stumping for Harris. \"That's not acceptable.\"Obama is expected in Michigan and other swing states in the coming days.Experts point to a Rust Belt path to victory for Harris, which means she would have to win Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. If Donald Trump wins Michigan, that's 15 electoral votes gone she would have to make up by winning one or several battleground states.Harris also needs to win over Michigan's large Arab American community, many of whom are still upset with the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.Democrats blame Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein for helping Trump win Michigan in 2016. She is now threatening to pull votes from Harris.\"It means more to them to lose this -- to continue the genocide than to actually try to win this election,\" Stein said Wednesday.Trump is also working to win Michigan, but he's getting called out for criticizing Detroit while speaking to the city's business community.\"I don't think anything that we're talking about today is high on her list. The whole country is gonna be like, you wanna know the truth? It'll be like Detroit, our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she's your president,\" Trump said Thursday. \"Well, we're a developing nation too. Just take a look at Detroit ... Detroit's a developing area. Hell of a lot more than most places in China.\"\"My opponent, Donald Trump, yet again, has trashed another great American city when he was in Detroit, which is just a further piece of evidence on a very long list of why he is unfit to be president of the United States,\" Harris responded Thursday in Las Vegas.The last time a Republican won Michigan before 2016 was in 1988. With Michigan now a toss-up, Harris's supporters are anxious to avoid repeating the 2016 outcome with Hillary Clinton.Have a news tip?

    "title": "Michelle Moons: Arab Americans Are Lining Up to Vote for Trump in Michigan",
    "content": "People keep asking me why Arab American citizens are moving toward voting for Trump. My answer? They are already Trump supporters - and enthusiastic ones. But they aren't registered to vote and keep telling us they don't know where or how to vote.My husband and I started the Conservative American Middle Eastern PAC - or CAM PAC - in October 2024 after a Trump supporting friend told us how much he was hurting financially but that he still wasn't registered to vote. Seeing this gap in Republican outreach to register Middle Eastern Americans, we couldn't wait for someone else to solve the problem.Since launching in Michigan, we have seen people willing to wait in line just to get registered and vote for Trump.One case in point is a Christian Iraqi American man named Bashar who approached the registration table we had set up outside of a Michigan grocery store last Wednesday just as we were about to wrap up for the day. Bashar told us that Democrats approached him three times to try to register him to vote for Kamala Harris, but he refused to do so until my group spoke with him and registered him as a Republican. He will now be voting happily for Donald Trump.\"This is the first time I see someone teach me how to vote Republican,\" he told us.Bashar said that before speaking with us, he had assumed that Trump was going to lose because he had not seen any Republican outreach, in stark contrast to all of the Democrats who had repeatedly tried to secure his vote. After registering himself, Bashar got his mother registered to vote too, and she will also be voting for Trump in November.On Tuesday, an 85-year-old woman and her sister approached our table and registered to vote after her children refused to help her vote for Trump. Both women are now registered to vote in this election for Trump.Another new voter who registered at one of our tables said he is Muslim and is voting for Trump because knows that Trump will fix our country.On Friday, we registered a 102-year-old woman whose dying wish is that Trump wins the 2024 presidential election. She and her friend, who we also registered, pray for Trump every day. One expressed that she was sad to see the assassination attempt on Trump's life in Butler, Pennsylvania.One 24-year-old woman who has never voted before, approached our tables specifically wanting to register so she could vote for Trump.Many more who have visited our registration tables have told similar tales that they did not know how or where to vote. One after another of these American citizens, now new voters, said they thought they could just show up with their ID at a polling place on election day and vote. They did not know they had to register first. CAM PAC has registering about 100 people after campaigning in just two locations for just two days alone.We are also has expanding our registration drive in Michigan beyond the Middle Eastern community. We've registered a number of Albanian American voters and are also doing outreach to Michigan's conservative Macedonian American community after learning that these voters are eager for information on how and where to vote before the state's registration deadline.Conservative grassroots activists like Tea Party Patriots founder Jenny Beth Martin and others have worked alongside us to make sure voters get registered and that every vote counts. Turning Point's Charlie Kirk has also sounded the alarm on his show that Republicans should leave no votes on the table, and he has pushed everyone to register to vote before the deadline expires.Online registration in Michigan ends on October 21.

    "title": "White House releases medical report on VP Kamala Harris - WFIN Local News",
    "content": "The White House on Saturday released a report from Vice President Kamala Harris' doctor declaring her to be in \"excellent health.\"The report, which was previewed by a senior Harris campaign aide, comes as the 59-year-old Democratic nominee seeks to contrast herself with former President Trump, 79, who has not made recent health disclosures.\"Vice President Harris remains in excellent health,\" wrote her Army physician, Dr. Joshua R. Simmons. \"She possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.\"VP HARRIS RELEASING DETAILED MEDICAL REPORT, CHALLENGING TRUMP TO DO THE SAMEAdvisers to Harris encouraged her office to release her medical history and health information to put a spotlight on Trump's health and mental acuity, since the 78-year-old Republican nominee would be the oldest president at the end of his potential second term, according to a senior aide.President Biden, 81, withdrew from the 2024 presidential election in July amid pressure from the Democratic Party given concerns over his advanced age and visible fatigue. Since then, Democrats have sought to go on offense against Trump with what was once their election vulnerability.During an August interview with CBS News, Trump insisted that he would \"gladly\" release his medical records, noting at the time that he had a \"perfect score\" on a recent medical exam. He has not yet done so.The letter from Dr. Simmons calls Harris' most recent medical exam in April 2024 \"unremarkable.\" The vice president has no major health issues and \"maintains a healthy, active lifestyle despite her busy schedule,\" including daily exercise. Harris eats a \"very healthy diet,\" does not smoke and drinks \"only occasionally and in moderation,\" according to her doctor.TOP 5 FRIENDLIEST MOMENTS FROM KAMALA HARRIS' MEDIA BLITZ: 'THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES'\"Vice President Harris is a healthy 59-year-old female who has a medical history notable for seasonal allergies and urticaria,\" the letter states. Urticaria is a common skin condition that can cause itchy, red raised bumps or welts to appear on the skin. It can be triggered by certain foods, medications or stress. Harris takes Allegra to manage her allergies and urticaria, and for the past three years she has undergone allergen immunotherapy (ATI).Other details from the report include that Harris is nearsighted and wears corrective contact lenses, that she has a family history of colon cancer (her mother died of colon cancer in 2009) and that she is \"up to date on all preventative care recommendations, including colonoscopy and annual mammograms.\"WHY TRUMP IS HEADED INTO 'THE BELLY OF THE BEAST': THE STREATEGY BEHIND HIS BLUE STATE STOPSThe decision to release Harris' medical information comes after a New York Times report asserted that Trump has not been transparent with his own health, even after a would-be assassin's bullet grazed his head at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania this past July.Trump did not release his medical records in his first White House campaign in 2016, the report notes. Neither did the Trump White House release accurate updates on his condition after a 2020 COVID diagnosis, with reports detailing that the president was more sick than his doctors said in public, according to the report.\"In 2024, days before becoming the official Republican presidential nominee for the third time, he was grazed by a would-be assassin's bullet, yet his campaign did not hold a briefing on his condition, release hospital records or make the emergency physicians who treated him available for interview,\" the report said. It goes on to quote several medical experts who raise concerns that Trump could enter the Oval Office in a second term with several \"potentially worrisome issues.\"\nThe last health update from Trump came in November 2023, when his personal doctor, Bruce Aronwald, said in a letter Trump's \"overall health is excellent.\"\"His physical exams were well within the normal range and his cognitive exams were exceptional,\" Aronwald wrote.In response to a request for comment, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung pointed to the letter released by Aronwald and reports from former White House doctor Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, who treated Trump after the failed assassination attempt in Pennsylvania.\"President Trump has voluntarily released updates from his personal physician, as well as detailed reports from Dr. Ronny Jackson who treated him after the first assassination attempt,\" Cheung said.\"All have concluded he is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief. He has maintained an extremely busy and active campaign schedule unlike any other in political history, whereas Kamala Harris has been unable to keep up with the demands of campaigning and reveals on a daily basis she is wholly unqualified to be President of the United States. Her schedule is much lighter because, it is said, she does not have the stamina of President Trump. Polls are reflective of this.\"",

    "title": "Betting markets show Harris falling behind Trump",
    "content": "In the latest plot twist of the 2024 presidential election season, it looks like former President Donald Trump has pulled ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris in betting market-based predictions.It wasn't even a month ago when Audacy reported that The Virtual Tout, a forecasting model developed by Northwestern University professor Thomas Miller, was expecting Harris to win the race by a landslide in the Electoral College not seen since the 1980s. Through early October, The Virtual Tout - a model based on forecasting from real money trading site PredictIt - showed Harris in a lead over Trump.According to The Virtual Tout site, the vice-presidential debate between Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Democratic Minnestoa Gov. Tim Walz on Oct. 1 did have an impact on forecasting. Throughout the month, forecasting for Harris got progressively worse. While she was predicted to have 302 electoral votes compared to Trump's 236, that story was totally flipped as of Friday, when she was predicted to have just 234 to Trump's 304.\"The market has been active and volatile, suggesting either that current investors are moving their money from one party to the other or that new investors are entering the market,\" said The Virtual Tout. It also noted that: \"For the first time in US history, we have seen a presidential election go from toss-up to Republican landslide, to toss-up, to a possible Democratic landslide, to toss-up, and to a Republican leaning election.\"In June, when President Joe Biden was still the Democratic candidate, polls showed Trump leading in key swing states. Just before their presidential debate, a poll indicated Biden and Trump were in a dead heat. After Biden's poor debate performance, he left the race and passed the reigns to Harris, who was leading Trump at the polls even before she became the official candidate in August.The Virtual Tout wasn't the only betting-market based forecast that showed Trump in the lead as of this weekend. This Saturday, Kalshi - a U.S. betting site that went live with presidential election betting earlier this month - showed Trump in the lead compared to Harris at 52% to 48%. Polymarket showed Trump in an even greater lead at 54.9% to Harris' 44.8% Saturday.\"Since the vice presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz, offshore betting markets have trended toward Trump, according to Polymarket, a crypto trading platform,\" USA Today said in an article this week. \"The primary driver: an influx of bets that raised the probability of Trump winning Pennsylvania.\"That's where Trump narrowly survived an assassination attempt this summer during a Butler, Pa., rally - escaping with a bloodied ear.Before Harris picked Walz as her running mate, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro was rumored to be a top contender for the role.According to USA Today, bettors also gave Trump a narrow chance of winning Wisconsin and Michigan as of Thursday morning. Compared to the 2016 and 2020 races, Trump appears to have better odds of winning this time, the outlet added. He eventually lost the popular vote in both races, but Trump won the 2016 election via the Electoral College.\"He had just a 17% probability of defeating Hillary Clinton as voters went to the polls in 2016, according to Betfair Exchange, the biggest U.K. peer-to-peer betting platform,\" said USA Today. In October 2020, bettors gave Biden a 68% chance of winning.USA Today noted that bettors don't always get it right. In 2016, Betfair odds gave Hillary Clinton with an 81% likelihood of winning. Still, they are usually spot on - the only other time bettors failed to predict the winner was in 1948, when Democrat Harry Truman beat Republican Thomas Dewey.Back in 2016, polls also indicated Clinton was expected to win, at 71.8% compared to Trump's 28.6%, according to FiveThirtyEight. While betting market-based forecast look at wagers people make on candidates, polls survey people about what they think and who they plan to vote for. One disadvantage polls have is that they are in the rearview mirror. On the other hand, betting markets convey real-time expectations.New York Times/Siena College Poll results indicated that Harris still has a lead and that more people believe she represents change and cares about people. A new pair of New York Times/Philadelphia Inquirer/Siena College polls also showed Trump in the lead in Arizona and Harris in the lead in Pennsylvania.FiveThirtyEight's aggregate of poll results showed Harris in the lead nationwide as of Saturday, at 48.5% to Trump's 46%. Even those results show a close race with not even a month to go until the 2024 election. Although The Hill's Decision Desk HQ forecast also showed Harris in a slight lead, it dropped from 52% earlier in the week to 51% as of Saturday.",

    "content": "Former President Donald Trump is currently leading Vice President Kamala Harris by 10 points on the Polymarket prediction platform -- a sharp reversal over betting odds in September.According to the latest Polymarket data, Trump currently has a 55% chance of securing the Oval Office in November compared to Harris' 45% chance.The former President also reversed Harris' lead in 4 of 6 swing states and now leads in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and Pennsylvania -- with Arizona and Georgia representing the GOP candidate's widest margins of victory.CNBC's Jim Cramer predicts a Harris winWhile Trump gradually overtook Harris on Polymarket, CNBC's Jim Cramer predicted that Harris would likely win the 2024 Presidential election in an Oct. 11 statement.\"I don't see how Donald Trump wins,\" the televised host asserted. Cramer's prediction sent shockwaves through social media due to a phenomenon known as the 'inverse Cramer effect'.The inverse Cramer effect is popular among cryptocurrency traders and posits that whatever predictions Cramer makes, the opposite will come true.Related: Musk: Polymarket 'more accurate than polls, as actual money is on the line'Trump's public relations effort to court crypto votersTrump's increasing odds on Polymarket coincide with the former President's highly public displays of support for the crypto industry meant to win over crypto voters.On Sept. 18, the GOP candidate used Bitcoin BTC $63,135 to purchase burgers at a New York bar. The campaign event followed on the heels of Trump's World Liberty Financial -- a decentralized finance project -- announcing the launch of a native token.This announcement turned out to be a double-edged sword that drew mixed reactions from the crypto community. \"I think it genuinely damages Trump's electoral prospects, especially if it gets hacked,\" Journalist Nic Carter argued.The veteran journalist further explained, \"It'll be the juiciest DeFi target ever, and it's forked from a protocol that itself was hacked.\" However, other industry professionals believe that the results of the 2024 Presidential election will matter little for the price of Bitcoin or the adoption of cryptocurrencies.Dan Tapiero -- founder of 10T Holdings -- recently predicted that the price of Bitcoin would reach $100,000 regardless of which candidate wins in November.Magazine: Harris' unrealized gains tax could 'tank markets': Nansen's Alex Svanevik, X Hall of Flame",

    "title": "When Will We Embrace the Idea of Female Leadership? - Milwaukee Courier Weekly Newspaper",
    "content": "As we approach the 2024 presidential election, the intersection of gender and politics is once again thrust into the spotlight. Gender dynamics, particularly sexism, are poised to play a crucial role in shaping electoral outcomes, especially if a female candidate emerges as a front-runner. The reluctance of some men to support a female president stems from deep-seated societal norms and biases that continue to pervade American political culture.Historically, the United States has lagged behind many countries in embracing female leadership. Nations such as New Zealand, Germany, and Liberia have successfully elected women to the highest offices, showcasing a willingness to break traditional gender barriers. Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand and Angela Merkel in Germany have not only held their positions but have been celebrated for their leadership styles, which often emphasize empathy and collaboration. In contrast, the U.S. has yet to fully embrace a woman as president, despite the fact that women possess the same capabilities and qualifications as their male counterparts.One of the most significant hurdles for female candidates in American politics is the pervasive presence of sexism. The notion that a woman's leadership abilities are inherently inferior to those of a man remains a barrier that many female politicians must navigate. This bias can manifest in various ways, from outright misogynistic comments to subtler forms of discrimination, such as questioning a woman's competence based on her gender. The 2016 election, where Hillary Clinton faced a barrage of sexist attacks, demonstrated how deeply ingrained these attitudes are within the electorate.The 2024 election may see a repeat of these dynamics, especially with figures like Kamala Harris potentially in the spotlight. Harris, as the first female Vice President and a woman of color, represents a significant evolution in American politics. However, her identity also subjects her to unique challenges. Women of color often face compounded biases, where both race and gender intersect to create additional layers of scrutiny and skepticism. The perceptions of their capabilities can be tainted by stereotypes that unfairly question their qualifications and assertiveness.Former President Donald Trump's willingness to undermine Harris's mental capabilities further illustrates the toxic blend of sexism and racism that can be weaponized against women of color in politics. By questioning her intellect, Trump not only reinforces harmful stereotypes but also taps into a broader narrative that suggests women, particularly women of color, are less fit for leadership roles. Such rhetoric can significantly influence voter perceptions and contribute to an environment where male candidates may be viewed as more competent, regardless of their actual qualifications.The 2024 presidential election presents a critical moment for America. As we witness a global trend toward female leadership, the U.S. must confront its own biases and barriers that hinder progress.The question of whether America is ready to elect a woman as president -- and particularly a woman of color -- remains at the forefront of political discourse. The electorate's willingness to challenge deeply ingrained sexism and embrace diversity in leadership will ultimately shape the outcome of this election.As we move forward, it is imperative for voters to critically assess their motivations and consider the qualifications of candidates based on merit rather than gender. The time has come for America to break free from the shackles of outdated perceptions and to embrace a future where leadership reflects the diverse fabric of our society. Only then can we truly claim to be a nation that values equality and representation at the highest levels of government.",

    "content": "PALM BEACH, FLA (Spurious News Network) -- Former president, current Republican presidential candidate and member of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Criminals list Donald Trump knows he will win the 2024 presidential election. He also knows the paltry $400,000 salary the job provides is far too low to satisfy his extreme spending habits, so he must do something to make more money.Which is why he has become an Amway distributor.\"Amway has been making America great again since before I was born,\" said Mr. Trump. \"Some of the richest people in America - not as rich as me, but still really rich - are Amway distributors. With me in the great Amway system founded by the beautiful DeVos and Van Andel families, we will not only make America great again but also bring prosperity to the millions who will join my downline.\"Amway, known as America's Worst Pyramid Scheme, bankrupts pretty much everyone who joins it. Trump believes he will be the exception. \"It's just the losers who don't understand business, like me, who do bad in Amway. Look at Dexter Yager, the greatest Amway salesman of them all. He had mansions and jets, all from Amway. I can do the same thing.\" While the late Dexter Yager was indeed a millionaire who owned mansions and jets, all those things came from his side business of manufacturing and selling training materials, which Amway distributors call tools, and running Amway seminars. Yager's core Amway business, which enabled him to sell tools and host seminars, operated at a loss like everyone else's does.Daniel F Martuscello III, commissioner of the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision, who will be Trump's landlord after the election, is not pleased: \"We don't see being an MLM member as an appropriate job for a New York inmate. He won't be allowed to do that in any of our prisons.\" Special Counsel Jack Smith, currently prosecuting Trump over the attack on the Capitol in 2021 and appealing a dismissal of a case about him stealing classified documents, is similarly down on his new business. \"Amway products and training materials are considered contraband in federal prisons so he won't be able to do Amway while he's locked up.\"Trump's supporters feel differently; over 10,000 of them have \"broken their kits\" - Amway speak for joining the company. \"I never thought about joining Amway until America's Greatest President did,\" said Mary Allen, a new distributor. \"I'm going to be Founders Crown Ambassador before you know it!\" The very rare Founders Crown Ambassador rank, Amway's highest, requires many years to achieve and honors people who build worldwide Amway networks. Mrs. Allen's entire house is currently filled with pallets of household goods purchased from Amway that she is trying to sell. \"I know people want these great products. You just need to work hard and riches will fall onto you.\"",

    "title": "Biden Approves Military Aircraft Support for Trump Force One",
    "content": "President Biden has approved military aircraft support and escorts for Donald Trump.Threats against the former president have escalated so significantly, including the threat from anit-aircraft missiles provided by state sponsors of terror, that Biden has approved complete presidential-level protection for Trump. This includes protecting his plane from threats.Since September, there have been reports--unconfirmed as far as I know--that surface-to-air missiles were smuggled into the United States with the intent to take out the former president's plane. After a new intelligence briefing the campaign officially asked for enhanced protection from the Air Force and armored vehicles to be provided to the campaign.Biden has approved the request, short of using air-to-air fighter aircraft, which should not be required in any case. Air superiority aircraft are unlikely ever to be necessary since foreign fighter aircraft aren't likely to fly in US airspace. Air Force One doesn't usually have fighter escorts.After two attempted assassinations and an ongoing threat from Iran, Donald Trump's campaign has ramped up requests for security, including transport by military aircraft and additional security measures on the ground at the former president's campaign stops, three sources familiar with the discussions told CNN.Trump's campaign wants to use these resources - including access to military aircraft with deterrent systems to protect against surface-to-air missiles - as the former president crisscrosses the US during the final weeks of the presidential campaign.President Joe Biden, when asked about Trump's requests on Friday, said they should be fulfilled - \"as long as he doesn't ask for F-15s.\"\"I've told the department to give him every single thing he needs ... as he were a sitting president,\" Biden said. \"If it fits into that category, that's fine.\"Susie Wiles, co-campaign manager for Trump, initially made the request for enhanced measures during a call about two weeks ago with Biden's chief of staff, Jeff Zients, two sources familiar with the conversation told CNN. Wiles then made the formal request for additional security with acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe on September 30, according to an email reviewed by CNN.A third source familiar with Wiles' call with Zients said Biden's chief of staff immediately connected Wiles to leadership at the Department of Homeland Security and Secret Service \"so she had a direct line.\" The source said Zients made clear that the president had directed the Secret Service to provide the highest level of protection for Trump.The requests from Trump's campaign also include access to Camp David vehicles for Trump's primary motorcade as well as access to other military assets, such as drones with thermal monitoring.It is a bit disturbing that there was such a large gap in time between the request and its approval, although I suspect that was a Ron Row/Alejandro Mayorkas issue, not a Biden-related delay. I have never suspected that Biden himself has been slow-walking protection for Trump. As usual, Mayorkas is at the center of action.Two sources close to the campaign said Trump officials are frustrated that the extra protections have not been implemented given the heightened security threats facing the former president, and the campaign has begun implementing some new security measures.According to one of the sources, Trump has started changing up his routine, taking different planes to events around the country and staying at different properties than he usually would as the 2024 presidential election nears.The source said Trump's security team implemented the changes because it had lost faith in the Secret Service following the two attempts on the former president's life as well as the denial of certain resources in the past. Trump's team maintains that its concerns are with those at the Secret Service headquarters, not with Trump's personal detail, many of whom have been with the former president since he left office.But Trump's team has also been informed that some of the requests aren't feasible for any presidential candidate. Trump has complained privately that he is forced to hold smaller rallies because of the security concerns, though every president and presidential candidate has faced restrictions on their freedom of movement because of security concerns, according to two sources familiar with the matter.Security resources are also often determined on a case-by-case basis, one administration official said.Secret Service management is determined to keep Trump vulnerable, and I think the stumbling blocks are in top management in Homeland Security. In other words, it is the Deep State operatives who are likely the offenders. I think Biden is corrupt, but I doubt he would order the Secret Service to keep Trump vulnerable. Bureaucrats like Mayorkas, though, have the power to approve or deny requests almost anonymously.By now, though, I do not doubt that SOMEBODY or somebodies in Homeland Security wants Trump dead.",

    "content": "Former President Trump's team has requested added security, including military aircraft, to further protect the GOP nominee in the final stretch of the 2024 presidential election, citing threats from Iran.Trump campaign co-manager Susie Wiles made a bevy of requests to Secret Service director Ronald Rowe Jr., including providing military aircraft that can shoot down surface-to-air missiles as the former president campaigns in battleground states, The Associated Press (AP) reported.The development was first reported by The New York Times.The campaign's request also included armored vehicles, expansion of temporary flight restrictions over Trump's residencies and rallies, and additional funding for local law enforcement agencies and the U.S. Secret Service (USSS). Wiles asked the USSS to pre-place the ballistic glass in all seven swing-states at Trump's outdoor rallies.Trump's team is looking to protect the Republican nominee on the same level as President Biden.\"Today, the former President is receiving the highest levels of protection,\" Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement to The Hill. \"The Secret Service will remain vigilant and continue to adjust and enhance its protective posture as needed to mitigate evolving threats.\"The push for additional protection comes after the former president was the target of two assassination attempts in the last few months. During a rally in Pennsylvania in July, his ear was grazed by bullet. In another incident last month, a man was arrested and charged for allegedly pushing the muzzle of a rifle through the fence of Trump's golf course in Florida.In late September, Trump was also briefed by intelligence officials about Iran's alleged threat against his life, a month after a Pakistani national with alleged links to the Iranian government was charged with plotting to commit a political assassination in the U.S.\"Assistance from the Department of Defense is regularly provided for the former President's protection, to include explosive ordnance disposal, canine units and airlift transportation,\" Guglielmi said in a written statement.\"Other enhancements the Secret Service has made include Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) over the former President's residence and when he travels,\" he added. \"Additionally, the former President is receiving the highest level of technical security assets, which include unmanned aerial vehicles, counter unmanned aerial surveillance systems, ballistics and other advanced technology systems.\"His comments come after the House and Senate passed legislation earlier this month to bolster security around political candidates, a move seen as a win for the Trump campaign.The Hill has reached out to Trump's campaign for comment.",

    "title": "Chaos swirls around Georgia election board, election measures",
    "content": "(The Center Square) - The Georgia State Election Board has faced backlash and lawsuits over the last few months, especially after passing a number of election rules just weeks before Election Day.The Republican-majority board had a win this week though when a Fulton County judge dismissed a lawsuit on Wednesday put forward by Democrats.The party sued to force Republican Gov. Brian Kemp to launch an ethics investigation into the board, which could lead to the impeachment of board members, after he refused to consider the complaints. Fulton County Chief Superior Court Judge Ural Glanville ruled the governor can not be compelled to open ethics complaints.Georgia is one of seven consensus swing states and will play a critical role in the 2024 presidential election. President Joe Biden won the state by 0.2% - about 11,000 votes - in 2020, one of two times since 1980 the Democratic candidate has carried the state.The board says the election measures it has passed will help ensure election integrity, while Democrats say it will hinder voting.In Georgia, early voting begins on Oct. 15.One of the rules the board passed was to require an additional hand count of all ballots cast on Election Day, while another will allow local election board members to take \"reasonable inquiry\" before certifying election results.Democrats have expressed concerns about the board's measures.\"Last minute regulations from the Georgia State Election Board threaten the integrity of electoral processes and violate the constitutional separation of powers,\" posted Right Count, an election integrity group. \"Right Count is now taking action with current and former Georgia legislators to stop them.\"Republicans have supported the board's decisions, and former President Donald Trump even praised the work of the three Republican board members at a rally in Atlanta in August.Featured Local SavingsIn another controversial move, the board is continuing an investigation into the 2020 election in Fulton County, where Atlanta is located.On Tuesday, the board voted to subpoena the election records from the county after the county and state election boards failed to reach an agreement.Board member Dr. Janice Johnston said Fulton County had not complied with an order from the board to hire a monitoring team or answered other questions.\"The State Election Board reached out to Fulton County multiple times, attempting to establish an acceptable monitoring team,\" Johnston said. \"Fulton County has failed to comply with that decision.\"Democratic state Rep. Saira Draper spoke at Tuesday's meeting.\"Not only is the nation watching us, the world is watching us,\" Draper said. \"We are amplifying lies and lies and misunderstandings, fundamental misunderstandings, of how election laws work.\"The Fulton County Board of Registration and Elections has sued the board, saying the board has \"no statutory authority to force the Fulton County BRE to accept, and Fulton County to pay for, election monitors hand-picked by the State Election Board.\"The same lawsuit called out the board's \"blitz of last-minute attempts to drastically impact the imminent general election.\"On Wednesday, Muscogee County Board of Elections and Registration filed an additional lawsuit against the board's passing of the hand-counting provision.Unless a judge rules on the decision prior to Election Day, that rule will stand and counties are preparing to follow it.",

    "content": "The Biden-Harris Department of Justice (DOJ) is suing Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) just weeks before the 2024 presidential election for removing non-citizens from his state's voter rolls.According to the complaint, the state Board of Elections and Virginia Commissioner of Elections Susan Beals claims Youngkin violated the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) by purging voters from the voter roll this close to the November election. The act requires states to complete their maintenance program by 90 days before an election under a clause known as the Quiet Period Provision.Under the governor's executive order, Virginia has removed over 6,000 individuals, including those illegally registered to vote. Youngkin's order ensured that the voter list had \"daily\" updates.\"The Executive Order formalized the Program and announced that 6,303 individuals had been removed from the rolls pursuant to the same process between January 2022 and July 2024,\" the complaint states.The complaint states that voters were considered non-citizens if they marked \"no\" to questions about their citizenship status on the state Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) forms.The Biden-Harris DOJ claimed that the move resulted in the cancellation of Virginia resident's voter registration.\"Systematic removal programs are more error-prone than other forms of list maintenance, and eligible voters placed on the path to removal days or weeks before Election Day may be deterred from voting or unable to participate in the election on the same terms that they would have but for the Commonwealth's error,\" the complaint states.Youngking accused Democrats of attempting to \"Attack the legitimacy of the elections in the Commonwealth\" and \"The very crucible of American Democracy.\"",

    "title": "Lessons from three tragedies: Adams, Williams, and Robinson | Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder",
    "content": "\"Black Vote, Black Power,\" a collaboration between Keith Boykin and Word In Black,examines the issues, the candidates and what's at stake for Black America in the 2024 presidential election.Three Black men have dominated the news in recent days for different reasons: Eric Adams, Marcellus Williams, and Mark Robinson. Their stories don't have much in common, but they reveal much about our country and our politics.First, Adams, mayor of New York City, was indicted Wednesday on bribery and corruption charges. Three years ago, when I was still living in New York, I refused to vote for him. Even after he was elected, I was still not a fan but gave him four years to prove me wrong.He did not prove me wrong.Last year, Adams refused to condemn a white man who choked a Black man to death on a subway train. In January, he vetoed a ban on solitary confinement in city jails and killed a plan to document police stops. Just as I expected, Adams brought back the racially biased stop-and-frisk policing that was ruled unconstitutional a decade ago.Adams is exactly who I thought he would be, and many of us tried to warn New Yorkers. But I remember talking to Black men in Harlem who supported him over a talented Black woman named Maya Wiley, in part because he's a Black man. For all the lies about Vice President Kamala Harris -- that \"Kamala is a cop\" -- Adams actually was a cop and a former Republican. But many Black men were still willing to support him.Second is Williams, a 55-year-old Black man from St. Louis, my hometown. The state of Missouri executed him this week after the Supreme Court refused to stop his execution, even though the prosecutor said the case against Williams was flimsy and tainted. The NAACP appropriately called the execution a \"lynching.\"A 6-3 Supreme Court decision split along party lines: the six conservatives approved his execution, while the three liberals voted to stop it. Donald Trump appointed three of the six conservatives; therefore, if Hillary Clinton had won in 2016, Williams would likely still be alive.Still, some people on social media tried to blame President Joe Biden and V.P. Harris for Williams's death. That's a damn lie. Missouri's Republican governor, Mike Parson, and Missouri's Republican Supreme Court approved the execution. It was the Democratic prosecutor in St. Louis County and the Democratic appointees on the U.S. Supreme Court who tried to stop it.No legal authority gives Biden the power to intervene or pardon Williams in a state murder case. So, if you're going to criticize Democrats, at least understand how our system of government works.Third, Mark Robinson, North Carolina's lieutenant governor, has been outed as a self-hating, hypocritically porn-obsessed Black Nazi who wants to bring back slavery and join the Ku Klux Klan. After all that, Trump and running mate JD Vance refuse to disavow him. This proves the point I've made many times that Republicans love Black people...who hate Black people.I get why white people support Robinson, but how the hell can any self-respecting Black person be associated with a party like this? Just this week, Louisiana Republican Clay Higgins called Haitian Americans \"wild,\" \"nasty,\" \"vudu\"-loving, pet-eating \"thugs\" who should get \"their a#$ out of our country.\" And even then, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson refused to condemn his racist rhetoric.\"Clay Higgins is a dear friend of mine and...a very frank and outspoken person. He's also a very principled man,\" Johnson said.First of all, Higgins admitted years ago that he voted for Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke for governor of Louisiana, so why is he a dear friend of Johnson's?Second, Johnson claimed that Higgins deleted the post after \"he prayed about it.\" It turns out that the \"very principled man\" only did so after the Congressional Black Caucus brought up a resolution to censure him.\"But, you know, we move forward,\" said Johnson. \"We believe in redemption around here.\"Redemption? No, sir. There can be no redemption without contrition. So, tell me: When will Trump, Vance, Higgins, and Elon Musk apologize to the Haitian Americans whose lives they've endangered in the most overtly racist major-party presidential campaign in 60 years?These people are not the least bit remorseful about their bigotry unless it blows up in their faces. And just like Robinson, they all had a long history of racist, sexist, and inflammatory rhetoric before these scandals erupted.And that's the problem. Too many Americans don't pay attention to their government until it's time for a presidential election every four years. But Adams, Williams, and Robinson show what happens when we don't.Our ignorance makes us susceptible to the click-baiters, cynics, opportunists, hoteps, bots and opps who spread misinformation for clout and pay.So stop listening to the clout-chasing clowns who don't know anything about government or politics, who try to get you not to vote or to throw away your vote. Stop listening to cynics peddling unrealistic expectations of what can happen in a single term in office and then weaponize your disappointment.We can't win if we don't participate, and we can't participate effectively if we don't know the rules.",

She then described Harris' work as attorney general, senator and vice president of California.Trump has falsely accused Harris of lying about her work at McDonalds as a teenager and misrepresented the role she played in the Biden administration's work on border security.Jill Biden painted a more compassionate picture of the Democratic presidential nominee as she talked about her work fighting crime as attorney general and how she helped a high school friend who was living in an abusive situation.\"That's the Kamala Harris I know: a fast, tough, compassionate, decisive leader, and that's the kind of president you Arizona deserves,\" she said.And Biden repeatedly attacked Trump for his role in appointing Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe vs. Wade undo.\"Donald Trump's abortion ban has deprived women of the ability to make their own health care decisions,\" she said.\"No one has to give up their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree that the government should not tell women what to do with their bodies,\" she said to loud applause.Reproductive rights have proven to be a winning issue for Democrats, who used them to get their base behind the ballot box in the 2022 midterm elections.Much of the First Lady's five-day, five-state campaign will focus on rallying voters on the issue.She also repeated some lines about Trump that she used while campaigning for President Biden, switching them up to work for Harris.\"As president, Kamala Harris will fight for you. Donald Trump still wakes up every day and thinks about one person: himself,\" she said.\"A new Donald Trump presidency would lead to more chaos, more greed and more division. He still wants to cut taxes for rich people like him while raising costs for everyone else.\"A New York Times/Siena poll showed Donald Trump six points ahead of Kamala Harris in Arizona - the state is hotly contested in the 2024 presidential electionIn addition to the first lady, the Harris campaign has sent running mate Tim Walz and second gentleman Doug Emhoff to Arizona. Harris will also be in the state.Early voting has begun in Arizona and the first lady reminded people that President Biden won the state in 2020 by just 10,457 votes.On Saturday morning in Phoenix, she spoke to a group of teachers who went out to collect votes, and she reminded them that every vote counts.\"You know, the first time I voted, I almost didn't vote for my future husband. It's true. Can you imagine if I hadn't done that? I mean, thank God I did that,\" she said.She commented she was a student at the University of Delaware at the time and Joe Biden was running for senator.\"Actually, Joe won that election by only 3,000 votes, so it could have easily gone the other way,\" she said.This is Jill Biden's fourth time in Arizona this year, but her first appearance for Kamala Harris.It's been about ten weeks since President Biden left the 2024 campaign.At the time, the first lady felt the sting of 'treason' Democrats who privately offered her husband support -- and then publicly called for him to quit the presidential race, those close to her told DailyMail.com.Jill Biden stood by Joe Biden's side in Wilmington, Delawareon that fateful day, he made his decision and even called Harris to express her support for the vice president.\"We love you,\" she told Harris, a source familiar with the conversation said. She also called Harris' husband Doug Emhoff, with whom she is close.Now she's making her support public with a high-profile campaign for Harris.In addition to stops out west in Arizona and Nevada, she will focus on the \"blue wall\" states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania - three states the party sees as crucial to Harris' victory.It marks Jill Biden's first return to the campaign trail since husband Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July and comes after reports of early tensions between the first lady and Vice President Harris.Before President Biden left office, Jill Biden was a high-profile Democratic surrogate for both her husband and other members of the party. In the 2022 midterm elections, more congressional and Senate candidates wanted her at their rallies than the president.Jill Biden was an enthusiastic campaigner for her husband and regularly went out to tout his achievements to voters. She led the Women for Biden-Harris effort, which saw her travel to battleground states where she praised the president and criticized Trump.The first lady, who supported the president as he resisted party leaders to stay in the fight, disappeared from the campaign spotlight after he resigned.She spoke at the Democratic National Convention and formally endorsed Harris, but otherwise focused on joining forces, women's health and her other initiatives as first lady.President Joe Biden gives wife Jill Biden a kiss after delivering the keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention in AugustEarly in the administration, it was reported that Jill Biden was angry with Kamala Harris over an incident during the 2020 primariesEarly in the Biden administration, there were reports of hard feelings between Jill Biden -- who is known to harbor grudges -- and Harris.Biden was angry at Harris for a line of attack in one of the early primary debates, targeting Joe Biden for his record on school busing in the 1960s as part of the desegregation effort.But those feelings -- along with any lingering resentment over her husband's treatment by party leaders -- seem to have been set aside for the greater goal of winning the election.The first lady started her campaign swing with a two-stop in Arizona and campaigned in Yuma and Phoenix.She will be in Carson City and Reno, Nevada on Sunday, while she will spend Monday in suburban Detroit and in Madison, Wisconsin.Her trip ends Tuesday with a stop in her hometown of Philadelphia.",

You know, he was scolding. Well, I don't know - last month at the convention, he was, 'No scolding!' Now he's scolding. He was saying, 'You gotta vote for Harris.'\"He concluded the point with one last joke, stating, \"But of course for some young - especially the younger Black men - it's tough choice.

In the 2022 midterm election, more congressional and Senate candidates wanted her at their rallies than they wanted the president.Jill Biden had been an enthusatic campaigner for her husband, regularly going out to tout his accomplishments before voters. She led the Women for Biden-Harris' effort that had her traveling to battleground states where she praised the president and criticized Trump.The first lady, who supported the president when he was pushing back against party leaders to stay in the contest, faded from the campaign spotlight after he stepped down.She did speak at the Democratic National Convention and formally endorsed Harris but has otherwise concentrated on Joining Forces, women's health and her other initiatives as first lady.President Joe Biden gives wife Jill Biden a kiss after he gave the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in AugustEarly in the administration Jill Biden was reported to be angry at Kamala Harris over an incident in the 2020 primary debatesEarly in the Biden administration there were reports of hard feelings between Jill Biden - who is known to hold a grudge - and Harris.Biden was upset at Harris for an attack line in one of the early primary debates, targeting Joe Biden for his record on school busing in the 1960s as part of desegregation efforts.But those feelings - along with any lingering feelings of resentment about her husband's treatment by party leaders - appear to have been set aside for the greater goal of winning the election.The first lady kicked off her campaign swing with a two-stop in Arizona, campaigning in Yuma and Phoenix.She'll be in Carson City and Reno, Nevada, on Sunday while she'll spend Monday in the Detroit suburbs and in Madison, Wisconsin.Her trip will wrap up on Tuesday with a stop in her hometown of Philadelphia.",

    "title": "Chaos swirls around Georgia election board, election measures - Washington Examiner",
    "content": "(The Center Square) - The Georgia State Election Board has faced backlash and lawsuits over the last few months, especially after passing a number of election rules just weeks before Election Day.The Republican-majority board had a win this week though when a Fulton County judge dismissed a lawsuit on Wednesday put forward by Democrats.The party sued to force Republican Gov. Brian Kemp to launch an ethics investigation into the board, which could lead to the impeachment of board members, after he refused to consider the complaints. Fulton County Chief Superior Court Judge Ural Glanville ruled the governor can not be compelled to open ethics complaints.Georgia is one of seven consensus swing states and will play a critical role in the 2024 presidential election. President Joe Biden won the state by 0.2% - about 11,000 votes - in 2020, one of two times since 1980 the Democratic candidate has carried the state.The board says the election measures it has passed will help ensure election integrity, while Democrats say it will hinder voting.In Georgia, early voting begins on Oct. 15.One of the rules the board passed was to require an additional hand count of all ballots cast on Election Day, while another will allow local election board members to take \"reasonable inquiry\" before certifying election results.Democrats have expressed concerns about the board's measures.\"Last minute regulations from the Georgia State Election Board threaten the integrity of electoral processes and violate the constitutional separation of powers,\" posted Right Count, an election integrity group. \"Right Count is now taking action with current and former Georgia legislators to stop them.\"Republicans have supported the board's decisions, and former President Donald Trump even praised the work of the three Republican board members at a rally in Atlanta in August.In another controversial move, the board is continuing an investigation into the 2020 election in Fulton County, where Atlanta is located.On Tuesday, the board voted to subpoena the election records from the county after the county and state election boards failed to reach an agreement.Board member Dr. Janice Johnston said Fulton County had not complied with an order from the board to hire a monitoring team or answered other questions.\"The State Election Board reached out to Fulton County multiple times, attempting to establish an acceptable monitoring team,\" Johnston said. \"Fulton County has failed to comply with that decision.\"Democratic state Rep. Saira Draper spoke at Tuesday's meeting.\"Not only is the nation watching us, the world is watching us,\" Draper said. \"We are amplifying lies and lies and misunderstandings, fundamental misunderstandings, of how election laws work.\"The Fulton County Board of Registration and Elections has sued the board, saying the board has \"no statutory authority to force the Fulton County BRE to accept, and Fulton County to pay for, election monitors hand-picked by the State Election Board.\"The same lawsuit called out the board's \"blitz of last-minute attempts to drastically impact the imminent general election.\"On Wednesday, Muscogee County Board of Elections and Registration filed an additional lawsuit against the board's passing of the hand-counting provision.Unless a judge rules on the decision prior to Election Day, that rule will stand and counties are preparing to follow it.",

    "content": "Recent data suggests that Vice President Kamala Harris may carry a slimmer majority of the Black vote in the 2024 presidential election than previously anticipated.The New York Times acknowledged on Saturday that Harris has significant work to do in the next few weeks if she's going to achieve the same level of Black support as previous Democrat presidential candidates.In 2016, Hillary Clinton pulled 92% of the Black vote. In 2020, President Joe Biden pulled a smaller but still commanding 90%. According to the most recent NY Times/Siena College poll from last week, Harris is only earning 78% support among Black voters. Over the last eight years, Black support for the Republican candidate has more than doubled since 2016 and currently stands at 15%.",

    "title": "Obama's Challenge to Black Men: Don't Fall for Trump's Lies",
    "content": "\"Black Vote, Black Power,\" a collaboration between Keith Boykin and Word In Black,examines the issues, the candidates, and what's at stake for Black America in the 2024 presidential election.Former President Barack Obama just ignited a firestorm of debate about Black men and manhood. Speaking to Black men in Pittsburgh on Thursday, Obama warned about the attitude of \"sitting out\" of the election \"or supporting somebody who has a history of denigrating you because you think that's a sign of strength.\" \"Putting women down\" is \"not acceptable,\" he said.His comment sparked criticism from those who felt Obama was scolding Black men again. I have a more nuanced take with two key points.First, Black men are a success story for Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party. After all the gaslighting from Republicans about Black men leaving the Democratic Party four years ago, Joe Biden won 87% of the vote from Black men in 2020. That makes us the second most loyal constituency of the Democratic Party. Only Black women, who voted 95% for Biden, are more supportive.A Washington Post-Ipsos poll last month found Black men overwhelmingly support Harris over Trump on every issue, including abortion, crime, the economy, and immigration. The Pew Research Center found that Black men are more confident in Kamala Harris than Trump to make good decisions about issues that affect us. A CNN poll last month found very little gender divide among Black voters. And research this summer found that Black men in Georgia supported Kamala Harris and strongly disapproved of Trump.RELATED: Stop Lying, Trump Didn't Solve Black UnemploymentThat means Kamala Harris will probably win 85 to 90% of Black men. That's good news, and Black men should be celebrated for that.Personally, I don't understand how any Black man could vote for Trump after he led a lynch mob against the now exonerated Central Park Five, lied about Barack Obama's birth certificate, blackballed Colin Kapernick out of the NFL, and bragged about bringing back racist policing tactics like stop-and-frisk. But I also know that unanimity of opinion is unattainable. No candidate or party is ever going to get 100% of Black people to support them, but 87% is pretty damn good.That's why I've said before that we can't pathologize Black men for our voting patterns when other groups, mainly white women, are the real problem.That brings me to my second point. Contrary to the hot takes on social media, I don't think Obama was scolding or pathologizing Black men. Instead, he was having an internal conversation with Black men to get us to examine some of the reasons that some of us don't support Kamala Harris. That's why the Black men Obama was speaking to in the room seemed to agree with him.The question is how do you increase voter turnout for Black men, when 66% of Black men said they planned to vote compared to 71% of Black women, and that tiny gap could make a huge difference in a close election.RELATED: 10 Big Lies Trump and the Republicans Tell About Kamala HarrisObama made a point that a small but vocal contingent of men, including Black men, refuse to support any woman candidate for president. Many of them have unrealistically high expectations for Kamala Harris but don't hold Trump to the same standards.One Black man in Pennsylvania told reporters he plans to vote for Trump because Harris \"doesn't come from a background similar to the majority of Black Americans.\" That makes no sense. Does he think a white man who spent his career refusing to rent to Black people and spreading racist lies about us understands the Black experience better than a Black woman who grew up in Oakland, attended Howard University, and joined AKA sorority? I'm sorry. I call bullshit. That man just doesn't want to vote for a woman.Obama wasn't speaking to all Black men. He was speaking to that man and to the Black men who have no problem with Trump selling cheap mugshots and $400 gold sneakers as \"Black outreach\" but when a Black woman who spent her entire life around Black people tries to get them to vote for her it's considered \"pandering.\" Just stop lying about why you're voting for Trump because you're making yourself sound ridiculous.\"And you're coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses, I've got a problem with that,\" Obama said. \"Because part of it makes me think -- and I'm speaking to men directly -- part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.\"It's the exact same message that Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul delivered on the \"Win With Black Men\" Zoom call with 40,000 Black men supporting Kamala Harris in July. \"Sometimes as Black men we get confused as to what strength is, and sometimes we think that standing behind a Black woman as a leader does not display strength as Black men,\" Raoul said.So why are we acting all new with Obama?He wasn't just focused on Black men. He delivered a similar message to all men at a rally in Pittsburgh the same day. \"I'm sorry, gentlemen -- I've noticed this, especially with some men who seem to think Trump's behavior, the bullying and the putting people down, is a sign of strength,\" he said. \"I am here to tell you that is not what real strength is and has never been.\"Obama is asking all men, including Black men, to rethink our relationship with women in positions of power, and to reevaluate our understanding of manhood.Being a man is not about controlling women, mocking the weak, or insulting the vulnerable. That's a caricature of manhood that Trump creates. Manhood is about honesty, fairness, responsibility, duty, and courage. A real man is secure enough in his identity to stand up in a crowd of \"yes men\" and tell them \"No\" when they do wrong.True manhood is powerful. It's about using our strength not just to help ourselves, but to help those in need.",

    "title": "Ralph Reed predicts Jewish vote will 'move' in Republicans' direction in 2024 election",
    "content": "The leader of a noted Evangelical advocacy group predicts that the Jewish vote will move in Republicans' direction in the 2024 presidential election as he forecasts a strong turnout among religious voters.Ralph Reed, founder and chairman of the Faith & Freedom Coalition, discussed his organization's ground game and efforts to reach out to faith-based voters ahead of the November election during a call with reporters on Wednesday.While Reed mostly discussed the organization's efforts to ensure \"Evangelical Bible-believing Christians\" and \"frequent Mass-attending Roman Catholics\" get to the polls, he also addressed the Coalition's outreach to Jewish voters.\"To the extent that a Jewish voter is modeled as socially conservative, they're going to be in our database and we're going to be knocking on their doors,\" he said. \"Because of our stands on Israel and our stands on antisemitism, which are among the most robust and muscular in the country, we have developed an awful lot of relationships in the Jewish community, both nationally and in these battleground states.\"\"We have a lot of friends that we work with,\" Reed said. \"Some of those are involved in the Republican Jewish Coalition,\" he added, noting that others are either involved in the Republican Party, active in their synagogues or are donors the Coalition.Noting how the election is taking place at \"a time of an existential crisis for the state of Israel\" and when Americans are seeing \"probably the most extreme forms of antisemitism, certainly that I can ever recall going on in our country,\" Reed said the polling he's seen indicates that \"the Jewish vote is going to move in a way that I have not seen in my career.\"Reed stressed that although he couldn't share the polling \"because it's proprietary and internal,\" he has seen data suggesting that \"the Jewish vote is moving. And in states like Pennsylvania  in Ohio, where you've got a key Senate race, in Michigan, it's going to matter, and it's going to matter in New York because of those battleground congressional races.\"\"Jewish voters are paying attention and they're paying attention to the way Harris and Biden have sought to appease Iran,\" he continued. \"And they're also paying attention to the extent to which Harris and Biden appear to be beholden to Arab voters, especially in Michigan, in a way that has compromised their ability to take stands on antisemitism.\"Reed's comments about Jewish voters reflect how the religious demographic tends to support Democrats in presidential elections but might be less inclined to do so this year due to concerns about how President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are handling the Israeli-Hamas conflict and antisemitism in the U.S.Exit polling from the 2016 presidential election showed that 71% of Jewish voters, who constituted 3% of the electorate that year, supported Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton, while just 23% backed Republican Donald Trump.While Reed shared his predictions about the Jewish vote, he cited his outreach to the community as just a small part of what he called \"the most ambitious, the most far-reaching and the most sophisticated ground game operation that has occurred on the center-right outside the Republican Party itself in your or my lifetimes.\"He expressed confidence that \"by the time we get to Election Day, we will have communicated with 17 to 18 million center-right voters of faith at the door.\"\"We are already at a point with 26 days to go where we have reached over five times as many voters at the door as we did in 2016, and roughly double the number we reached in 2020,\" he asserted. Reed outlined the Coalition's efforts to reach \"truly low propensity voters\" in the final weeks leading up to the election, referring to \"people who have voted in one or fewer of the last three elections.\"Reed detailed how \"there are about 700,000 of those in Pennsylvania, there are about 500,000 of those in Georgia and then there's subsets of that who are really the true target.\"Describing this group as \"the bullseye\" for securing a victory for Trump in the election, he remarked, \"If we can get even half of those smaller data sets to actually vote either on Election Day or preferably before, it's going to be a game changer, I assure you.\"\"It will be more than the margin separating Trump and Biden by a multiple,\" he proclaimed. In the 2020 election, Trump lost Georgia by fewer than 12,000 votes and lost Pennsylvania by just over 80,000 votes.Winning those two states in the 2024 presidential election along with every state he won in the 2020 presidential election would give him exactly 270 electoral votes, the magic number needed to win the presidency.Reed's discussion of the Coalition's ground game focused on Georgia and Pennsylvania in particular. He listed the number of paid staffers his organization has deployed in Pennsylvania at 300, while acknowledging the presence of \"hundreds of volunteers beyond that.\" In Georgia, the Coalition has 185 paid staffers reaching out to voters ahead of Election Day along with 600 volunteers. Reed also weighed in on his organization's outreach efforts in all the battleground states.\"We have thousands of paid canvassers, depending upon the week, between  and 5,000, but we also have thousands of volunteers. So we're reaching these doors and these voters for far less per home visit because a lot of our people are volunteering their time,\" he said.\"We're using the most sophisticated data science to model these voters. We know whether they voted by mail early in the past or whether they wait until Election Day so that we can drive them in developing their plan to vote.\"Characterizing the Coalition's voter mobilization efforts as \"the Gold Standard, at least on the center-right in the country,\" Reed said, \"I'm really proud of what our team is accomplishing.\"Highlighting how \"there's never been anything like this in my career and it's going to make a big difference,\" Reed remains confident that support from Evangelical voters will be enough to put Trump over the top in the presidential election: \"In 2016, Donald Trump received approximately 24 million Evangelical votes. In 2020, that number increased to 34 million in change. So the total number of Evangelical voters increased by about 13 million and he got 10-11 million of them.\"\"We think conservatively we're going to see another increase and we think on the low side, it's going to be a gross number of 5 million and we think it could go as high as 7 million,\" he said. \"So, you'd be talking about in two cycles, the number of votes that this constituency is delivering to the bottom line increasing by as many as 18 million votes in two presidential cycles.\"Reed reacted to a study from the Cultural Research Center at Arizona Christian University forecasting that 32 million self-identified Christians plan to abstain from voting in the 2024 election by declaring \"It doesn't really comport with what we're seeing on the ground.\"Reed highlighted how the Coalition had modeled \"45.1 million Evangelical Christians who are currently on the voter file,\" insisting that \"In the battleground states that will matter, not just presidential but Senate and even Congressional, they're going to come and they're going to come in big numbers.\" He estimated that \"on the low side, it's going to be 75% turnout\" while \"on the high side, it's going to mid-80s to upper 80s% turnout of those who are registered.\"Reed claimed that \"self-identified Evangelical Christians turn out\" to vote \"at a much higher rate than\" both \"all voters\" and \"all Republicans.\" While saying \"it varies from state to state,\" he estimated \"50-60% turnout for all voters, 70-75% turnout for registered Republicans or modeled Republicans and it will be, depending upon the state, 6-10 points higher turnout if you are an Evangelical Christian.\"Reed responded to concerns that unregistered Evangelicals could have an impact on the outcome of the election, telling The Christian Post \"we estimate that there's somewhere between 10 and 15 million unregistered Evangelicals.\" He contended that \"by the time everything shakes out this cycle, we believe that about 6 million-7 million of those will register to vote this cycle.\"Conceding that \"we'll still have a lot of unregistered\" Evangelical voters, Reed mentioned that \"we're doing a lot in churches, we're doing a lot digitally to reach those unregistered Christians primarily using consumer data because they're not on the data file.\" He reported a \"tremendous amount of success\" in registering new voters, specifically at Hispanic churches.\"I don't think the picture is quite as bleak as that study would indicate,\" Reed added. \"Two can both be true. It's true that there are a lot of self-identified Christians who either aren't registered or don't participate but it's also true that the number who participate is the highest in modern American political history and that they participate and turn out at much higher rates than secular voters.\"",

    "title": "Trump Gains Ground as Harris Falters in Key Battleground States",
    "content": "Former President Donald Trump is showing signs of resurgence in his bid for a second term, as Vice President Kamala Harris faces a dwindling lead in critical battleground states, raising concerns among Democrats just weeks before the election, The Hill reported.With the 2024 presidential election fast approaching, Trump is seeing an uptick in his chances for a second term, while Harris' early momentum appears to be waning. According to the latest election forecast by The Hill and Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ), Harris' chances of victory on Nov. 5 have dropped to 51%, down from 56% in late September.In key battleground states, Trump now leads in five out of seven, reversing the 4-3 edge Harris held earlier in October. Polls show tight margins, making it difficult to predict a clear winner. While national polls still favor Harris, with a 2.9-point advantage, the real challenge lies in the Electoral College, where battleground states could determine the outcome, as seen in the 2000 and 2016 elections.Concerns among Democrats are growing as Trump's recent gains have shifted the political landscape. Harris' national advantage might not be enough to secure victory, especially given the narrow polling margins in states like Michigan and Wisconsin, where she has recently lost ground. In Michigan, she had a 2-point lead in mid-August; in Wisconsin, she held a nearly 5-point advantage in late August. Both states now lean toward Trump, adding to the unease among her supporters.Several factors could influence the election's outcome. Polling accuracy has been questioned, particularly after misses in previous elections. Additionally, significant issues like abortion, which favors Harris, and immigration, a key Trump talking point, could drive voter turnout. However, the polls also offer only a snapshot, and with weeks remaining until Election Day, new developments could still sway public opinion.Harris, who has led in national polls since President Joe Biden stepped aside, remains under pressure to maintain her visibility. Over the past week, she has increased her media appearances, including interviews on CBS's \"60 Minutes\" and ABC's \"The View,\" along with a town hall event with Univision. While her media presence has been steady, some moments, particularly evasive answers during the \"60 Minutes\" interview, have led to criticism from opponents.However, even in friendly settings, her failure to conclusively show how she differentiates herself from Biden has caused her to face pushback, with critics quick to seize on any perceived missteps.Meanwhile, while former President Barack Obama campaigned in Pittsburgh, he suggested that sexism may be hindering Black male voter turnout for Harris, an opinion that has sparked controversy in the Democratic party.Despite these challenges, Harris' fundraising remains a bright spot for her campaign. She has raised over $1 billion, significantly outpacing Trump's efforts. However, the high expenditure rate, with her campaign spending $7.5 million per day in August compared to Trump's $2.6 million, may show that the Republican platform speaks to voters more than the advertising dollar.Jim Thomas ✉Jim Thomas is a writer based in Indiana.

    "content": "Who is not allowed to vote in the 2024 presidential election?Jeremy TannerOctober 12, 2024 at 4:30 PM(NEXSTAR) - The United States is just weeks away from a highly-anticipated presidential election, but not everyone will be able to exercise their right to vote on Nov. 5.Being at least 18 years old and a U.S. citizen are general requirements for voting, but individual states have their own laws that prohibit voting for a number of reasons.Convicted felonsIn all jurisdictions except Maine, Vermont and the nation's capital, people convicted of felony crimes lose the right to vote while incarcerated.In half the states, felony voting restrictions extend after incarceration, often including their time on probation or parole, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL). In some states, convicted felons lose their voting rights indefinitely for certain crimes.In recent years there has been a general trend toward reinstating the right to vote at some point.Inmates in the following states won't receive automatic restitution upon release, but will have to wait until completion of sentence (which may also include parole, probation, fines, fees and a post-sentencing waiting period or other required action): Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Georgia, Delaware, Idaho, Florida, Kansas, Iowa, Louisiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, Nebraska, Tennessee, North Carolina, Virginia, Oklahoma, Wyoming, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, West Virginia and Wisconsin.See the NCSL website for more details.Unregistered votersUnless you live in North Dakota, you'll need to be registered to vote before the election.Anyone who has lived in North Dakota for 30 days before the election can vote, according to the secretary of state. Voters do, however, have to bring a valid form of ID to the polls.About 20 states allow people to register on Election Day and then immediately cast a ballot.Voters in 13 states have less than a week to register. When is your deadline?The remaining states require some sort of advance registration, with deadlines ranging from three to 30 days before an election. Many of the states with voter registration deadlines more than two weeks ahead of the election are located in the South.Those without identificationIn roughly three-quarters of U.S. states you won't be allowed to vote if you don't have identification.Twenty-one states request a photo identification, such as a driver's license or government-issued card, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Fifteen additional states accept non-photo identification, such as a utility bill or bank statement that lists a person's name and address.In some states, there are workarounds for people who forget their identification, such as signing an affidavit of identity or filling out a provisional ballot that will be counted if they come back with their ID or if election workers can verify their signature.States that don't require proof of identify use other means to verify voters, such as signatures or asking for home addresses.People voting absentee or by mail could face additional requirements, such as getting a witness to sign their absentee ballot envelope.Voters with mental disabilitiesWhile the rights of voters with disabilities are protected by federal law, a number of states have laws under which a judge can bar people deemed \"mentally incapacitated\" from voting.Other states have laws prohibiting people under legal guardianship from voting. While someone under guardianship may not have the decision-making capacity to take care of one or more of their daily needs, it may not mean that they are unqualified to vote.Despite the Justice Department affirming the voting rights of people with disabilities earlier this year, it doesn't appear that there has been much enforcement from the Biden administration.Citizens of U.S. territoriesResidents of U.S. territories are not able to vote in the general presidential election unless they have official residency in a state or the District of Columbia. To vote, they would have to either return to the U.S. or vote via absentee ballot.The Electoral College process doesn't allow people living in Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa and the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands to vote.The Associated Press contributed to this report.For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.",

    "title": "Politics and investing: Don't let team colors cloud your judgment |    Chattanooga Times Free Press",
    "content": "The 2024 presidential election is nearly upon us, and the airwaves and social mediasphere are saturated with dire predictions of financial doom attendant to victory by one or the other party.To be sure, electing a president is a momentous event and should be taken seriously based on sufficient information from a robust variety of diverse sources.But what about investment decisions? Should individuals be tinkering with their portfolios based on their assessment of the most likely electoral outcome? Short answer: It's a loser's game, so move on to something more productive. If you want the longer answer, read on.Stock performance is much more correlated with economic fundamentals and business cycles than with quadrennial elections. Individual occupants of the Oval Office exert very limited influence on stock market performance, contrary to what many voters and investors may believe.In fact, there is compelling evidence to suggest that the causation works in the opposite direction: Election of Republican or Democratic presidents is the consequence and not the cause of the cyclical economic fluctuations that drive stock returns. Investors would be much better served by eschewing political handicapping and simply remaining invested.Even if one could accurately predict the outcome of a close election, it is not at all certain that a successful guess can be profitably exploited, particularly since much of the conventional wisdom regarding stock performance by political party is faulty. For example, a recent YouGov survey found that Americans believe Republicans are better at handling the economy than Democrats by a margin of 43% to 31%. Yet historically, the economy and the stock market have performed better under Democratic presidents.Trigger warning: This is not intended to be a partisan endorsement of progressive policies, but an observation of historical data. Stay tuned for a plausible explanation.Over 95 years since 1928, real GDP growth has averaged around 4.5% per year under Democratic presidents compared with 1.8% under Republicans, according to Morgan Stanley. More contemporary data since 1945 from Jeffrey Frankel at Harvard's Kennedy School yields similar results, with average real GDP growth of 4.2% under Democratic administrations versus 2.4% under GOP presidents.The U.S. stock market has also performed better under Democratic chief executives. Morgan Stanley reports that since 1928, average annual returns for the broad U.S. stock market during Democratic administrations has been around 10% per year, compared with the Republican average of about 4%. Looking at cumulative returns over the 4-year term of each administration since 1928, Democrats turned in an average gain of 45% versus 18% for Republicans.The historical outperformance of the economy during Democratic presidential administrations may seem counterintuitive and remains somewhat perplexing to economists. In fact, as early as 2003, researchers referred to the disparity as the \"presidential puzzle.\" A 2017 paper by two economists with the National Bureau for Economic Research put forth a compelling thesis, arguing that election outcomes are the result rather than the cause of economic and market cycles.Lubos Pastor and Pietro Veronesi posit that investors and voters are subject to a time-varying risk tolerance; that is, they become more conservative or risk-averse during recessions and are willing to accept lower investment returns in exchange for more safety. This risk aversion also translates into political support for Democrats who are broadly viewed as more enthusiastic toward government intervention and safety net expenditures, resulting in a Democratic presidential victory.Conversely, during periods of rapid economic growth, risk appetite increases as investors seek higher returns, tending to favor Republican candidates generally perceived as advocating lower taxes and a lighter government footprint. Recessions lead to Democratic wins, while expansions favor Republicans.This hypothesis is useful in understanding the divergence between perception and historical economic reality. Each of the past five recessions and nine of the last 10 began under Republican presidents, helping explain the significant disparity in average economic growth by party.The key point to take away is not a partisan perspective on either party's economic acumen or their impact on investment returns. The pro tip here is to vote your conscience and beliefs on Election Day but invest apolitically every day.LPL Financial offers an enlightening illustration. Suppose you invested $100,000 in 1950 and remained invested in the market only during Republican administrations, going to cash when a Democrat was elected. By Jan. 1, 2024, your \"red\" portfolio would have grown to $1 million. Conversely, investing only during Democratic terms would have swelled a \"blue\" portfolio to $3 million. These are paltry sums compared with the $32 million return from simply parking your money in the S&P 500 and watching it grow.This lesson must be relearned during every election cycle. A recent survey by UBS found that 77% of wealthy investors intended to make portfolio changes in anticipation of the 2024 election. Yet despite a war in the Middle East, interest rates at two-decade highs and a relatively unpopular Democratic administration, real GDP grew at a 3% annual clip in the second quarter and the S&P 500 has closed at a record high on 41 separate days so far this year.James Carville, Bill Clinton's aphoristic political strategist, famously set the tone for the 1992 campaign: \"It's the economy, stupid.\" Economic fundamentals drive investment returns and, it turns out, political fortunes as well. Presidents are not nearly as important to your retirement portfolio as time and the magic of compound returns.Christopher A.

    "title": "Kennedy: The rise and fall (and rise) of Jimmy Carter |    Chattanooga Times Free Press",
    "content": "Former President Jimmy Carter turned 100 years old on Oct 1.Even many people who think he was a mediocre president concede that Carter has entered the last stage of his life on a high note.Carter has been under hospice care for brain cancer for 19 months, although hospice patients typically live no longer than six months. He has said he wants to vote in the 2024 presidential election.Some people consider Carter a national treasure for his post-presidency endeavors. A longtime Sunday School teacher in his hometown of Plains, Georgia, Carter has, through his actions, spent more than four decades quietly spreading Christian virtues at home and around the world. He has championed democracy, built hundreds of houses for the poor through Habitat for Humanity and led the push to eradicate an awful parasitic disease that once struck millions of people a year in Africa and Asia.While my personal politics have swung from left to right, and settled back in the middle, I've always considered Carter a person worth admiring. He sets a high bar for what a person can achieve in \"retirement.\"(\nI met him on Oct. 1, 1986, when the Carter Library first opened in Atlanta. It was his 62nd birthday. I thought his statement to reporters about all the things he wanted to do with the rest of his life sounded like platitudes. Turns out he was dead serious.As a young adult, I had a poster of Carter on the wall of my apartment. (OK, I know that might strike some people as weird.)\"So, you had a poster of Jimmy Carter instead of Farrah Fawcett?\" a friend recently asked me.I wouldn't have put it that way, but yes.Somebody I respect summed up their impression of Carter the other day: \"... Terrible president, but he's going straight to heaven.\"I'm not sure he's even the worst president of the 1970s, but I'll endorse the \"going to heaven\" part.When I was in high school, I read every book published about Watergate and still remember the cast of characters in the Nixon White House better than any group of presidential aides before or since. Most journalists of my generation were influenced by the work of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the two reporters who broke most of the Watergate story in The Washington Post.Former President Carter, a little-known Democrat from the South, was swept into office in 1976. The Republicans were still reeling from President Richard Nixon's resignation after the Watergate scandal. It was a different day in national politics. Believe it or not, in the 1976 election, Carter carried Alabama, Mississippi, Texas and South Carolina over the incumbent, Gerald Ford.Carter's life is a story of rise and fall ... and rise again.His resume reads: farmer, Navy veteran, Southern state governor, president of the United States, Nobel Prize winner, humanitarian. The list goes on. The two character-driven resume lines I respect most are these: Sunday School teacher and widower -- he was married 77 years to his childhood friend, Rosalynn, who died last fall.(\nI also respect the fact that he didn't shrivel up as a man after losing his bid for reelection in 1980. Caught up in the Iran hostage crisis and custodian of a bad economy, he was was crushed by Ronald Reagan 489 to 49 in the Electoral College count that year. A lesser man might have drifted into obscurity.After what must have been a period of deep personal embarrassment, Carter gathered himself and went about being the best version of himself he could be.That aforementioned parasitic infection is called Guinea worm disease. It used to strike over 3 million people worldwide annually and cause excruciating pain. Quietly, Carter's foundation set out to eradicate the disease, and now there are only a handful of cases worldwide each year. He also swung a hammer for Habitat for Humanity until he was 95 years old.So, the next time you hear someone make fun of Jimmy Carter, please remember that he answers to a higher power.In the words of the hymn, \"All is well ... with (his) soul.\"(Editor's note: This column was filed on Oct. 7, 2024.)Family Life is published on Sundays in the Chattanooga Times Free Press newspaper.

    "title": "Exclusive: Mark Cuban on Backing Kamala Harris and His Concerns About Trump",
    "content": "Mark Cuban believes a second Donald Trump term would be \"worse\" than his first, which is why he's become one of Vice President Kamala Harris' leading evangelists in the 2024 presidential election.Cuban, a billionaire entrepreneur and ABC's Shark Tank television star, has vocally backed Harris in interviews and on social media since she received the mantle from President Joe Biden and quickly shored up the Democratic Party's nomination this summer after Biden stepped down from the race. While Cuban has said he was initially a fan of Trump's candidacy when he first announced his intentions back in 2015, he has now soured completely on the former president.Over the past few months, the Shark Tank star has readily engaged Trump supporters and fellow billionaire Elon Musk to defend Harris against their attacks. Musk, the CEO of Tesla, founder of SpaceX and owner of X, formerly Twitter, has become one of Trump's leading surrogates, and Cuban has utilized X as a key platform to pushback against Musk and Trump allies.The businessman told Newsweek that he viewed Trump's first term as \"bad,\" warning that a second term will be \"worse.\" He also views Harris as someone that will work with Republicans and independents.\"She is not an ideologue,\" he said, describing her as \"far more stable\" and \"open minded.\" In particular, Cuban views Harris' economic policies as good for the country, saying they will benefit everyday Americans and small businesses.Newsweek did an exclusive email interview with Cuban on Friday. The interview has been lightly edited for clarity.Newsweek: You've become a very vocal supporter of VP Harris. Why did you decide that it was important this election to be out there in such a big way supporting her candidacy?Cuban: I thought a first term by Donald Trump was bad. A second term would be worse.You've defended a lot of Harris policies that have been attacked by conservatives. What are your thoughts on policies such as \"no tax on tips,\" tax credits for new home buyers as well as her plan to crack down on price gouging?All are worthwhile. For real estate and gouging, they make national programs that were already in place across most states. For tips, I think it's a way to increase take home pay for those who don't have consistency in their daily earnings.One big issue you've been working on is the cost of prescription drugs. Can you explain a bit about what you're trying to do? And how should Harris try to fix this issue as well as health care more broadly if she wins?I've learned quite a bit from CostPlusDrugs.com. In particular that the pharmaceutical industry is the most opaque I have ever seen. It is basically an arbitrage by middlemen trying to squeeze margin anywhere they can. They can do this because the industry is opaque.What we have learned at Cost Plus Drugs, is that when prices and mark ups are transparent, the market becomes more efficient and prices go down quickly and dramatically. It also allows self-insured companies to reduce their cost of pharmacy coverage.I think that by requiring all prices to be published, no matter how complex, self-insured employers, that cover 124 million plus members will be able to negotiate far better prices for pharmacy and health care.In your conversation with other business leaders, what are their sentiments regarding Harris v. Trump? Do you think you are having an influence on your peers in the business world?I deal with three types of businesses, the big ones, with say more than 100 employees. Subchapter S and LLC businesses and sole proprietors.The biggest companies that are in oil and gas are more open to Trump. The rest I haven't seen many people get excited about him. Yes, they may prefer his lower tax rates, but the lack of stability, the possibility of tariffs, particularly hate tariffs like he threatened John Deere with and just the general uncertainty is a huge negative.They know that Kamala is far more stable, open minded, she has done a great job communicating with business leaders, she is not an ideologue, she takes feedback from Republicans, independents and more.She has also been clear that she will support and deploy new tech to make permitting and other government functions smaller and more efficient. That's been a big plus.For smaller pass-through companies, I don't think the campaign has done a good enough job talking to the 33 million small companies in this country. There are 23 million solo entrepreneurs, 8 million or so Subchapter S and LLCs that pay taxes at their personal rate. Probably 98 percent of them are taxed at their personal rate.What the campaign has done a poor job explaining is her promise that no one making $400,000 or less will see an increase in taxes and 100 million will see their taxes  down -- applies to all of them! Add to this the fact that their deductible start-up costs increased to $500,000, what that means is 100 percent of companies that start this year will see their taxes go down.What is your biggest concern for the U.S. and the world if Donald Trump wins?That I have no idea what will happen if he wins. Only he knows.Many Democrats have said that democracy is on the line and Trump has threatened to arrest political opponents and critics. Do you think these are valid concerns and that Trump would follow through on those threats?Yes.Trump is doing particularly well with men. Elon Musk, who you've criticized, also has a largely male fanbase. What do you think it is about these male billionaires that is so appealing to many men? And as a fellow male billionaire, what would you say to those men who admire Musk and Trump?The American Dream is alive and well. I admire Elon the entrepreneur. I also think Elon the Twitter (X) owner is a world class troll.Some progressives have criticized you for opposing Federal Trade Commission (FTC) chair Lina Khan. What is your response to their criticism?I don't oppose her. I'm not advocating for her dismissal. I've said many times what she has done with PBMs  and scam companies is invaluable. Where I have  she has made a huge mistake is her advocacy to break up large tech companies. I think the ability of our large tech companies to win the global AI  battle is the greatest challenge our country has economically and militarily.There has been speculation that you could serve in the Harris administration. Is that something you're interested in?No. I love what I'm doing with Cost Plus Drugs and the chance to disrupt all of health care.",

In some cases, there are exceptions for rape and incest.On the other end, some states have no limits. Under Democratic Vice Presidential candidate Tim Walz, Minnesota has granted broader abortion freedoms.If a baby survives an abortion, doctors are under no obligation to provide life-saving aid to the child as JD Vance said during the Vice Presidential debate.Ipsos, on behalf of Redfin, surveyed 1,802 Americans between the ages of 18-65, asking them why they would move within a year and the importance of living in a state where abortion is \"fully legal.\"Fifty-nine percent of millenials want to live in a state without abortion limits, 24% do not want to, while 16% don't care.

On \"The Victor Davis Hanson Show,\" Hanson described Smith, who recently succeeded in having Judge Tanya Chutkan unseal his latest court filing against Trump, as \"out of control.\"TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\"Well, Jack Smith is crazy, he's out of control. He's violated the DOJ zone handbook of ethical behavior, that you don't indict a major political figure or you don't further a prosecution 90 to 60 days out,\" Hanson said.\"He's been disgraced when he went after the Virginia Governor Bob McConnell and he was reversed 9-0 by the Supreme Court for trying to demonize him,\" Hanson added. \"So he has a reputation that if you want to destroy a political candidate on the right, you take this Jack Smith and he'll do anything, anytime, anywhere and he has no ethics.\"Hanson continued, stating that if Trump wins the 2024 presidential election, he believes Smith will persuade a \"biased jury\" to convict Trump. He also claimed that if Trump were jailed, Vice President Kamala Harris would invoked the 25th Amendment against President Joe Biden, allowing her to assume the presidency.

    "title": "What is a lame duck? The term lame duck heard at the end of Jokowi's mandate",
    "content": "TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Transition period or transition of the government of President Joko Widodo or Jokowi with the government of President-elect Prabowo Subianto is considered the longest. In total, eight months have passed from the close of the 2024 presidential election to the inauguration day of the president-elect.Muslim scholar, Professor Azyumardi Azra, once said that this long lag made the incumbent president a \"lame duck\" or a \"lame duck\". The indication, he said, is that the current president can no longer issue effective and strategic policies.\"Because there is already a new president and a new vice president, even if they have not yet been appointed,\" in a statement in Jakarta, Saturday, June 25, 2022, quoted by Antara.Recently, the term lame duck has appeared in various political discussions. Describes Jokowi's power as president beginning to decline.So what is a lame duck?The phrase lame duck, aka lame duck, doesn't actually come from the political world. City of the book \"Dictionary of Brewer's Phrases and Fables\", This expression originates from the world of finance. Usually used in reference to a trader or broker who is unwilling or unable to pay for their losses.This expression also applies to people who default on payments and has existed since the 18th century in London, England. People like this are usually referred to or satirized with phrases that describe them waddling around like lame ducks.The term lame duck entered the political world and first appeared in the United States in 1863 to refer to \"declining politicians.\" The first president to be called a lame duck was Calvin Coolidge, during the second term of his administration. Calvin's administration would come under Senate control when Herbert Hoover became the next president.Phenomenon lame duck This happens because a politician is seen as having less influence over other politicians because his term is coming to an end soon. This condition occurs if the politician loses the election for the next term, does not run again, or because he or she is removed from office and is waiting for a replacement.Former spokesperson for the 11th Vice President of the Republic of Indonesia, Boediono, Yopie Hidayat, in the Sunday, February 18, 2024 edition of Tempo Magazine, revealed that the waiting time for Prabowo's inauguration was relatively very long. In the United States, for example, lame duck only lasts about two months. Elections were held in November, and in January of the following year a new president was installed.According to Yopie, too long a lame duck period in Indonesia can actually lead to serious legal problems. Additionally, in Indonesia there are no clear rules on what can or cannot be decided by a president who is nearing the end of his term.Towards the end of his term, he said, the president will certainly not make major decisions that will have a long-term impact. On the other hand, it is not certain that the new president will have the same views on the political choice, even though it is he who must implement it and bear the consequences.\"For example, if there is turbulence in the market that leads to the outbreak of a crisis. \"The lame-duck government doesn't have time to deal with this,\" he said.As for the 2019 presidential election, the transfer of power has not changed since Jokowi was elected for the second time. However, the conditions were different from those of the 2014 presidential election, where President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono or SBY was replaced by Jokowi from the then opposition party PDIP.At that time, the time between the presidential election and the inauguration was only three months. The presidential election was held on July 9, 2014, and then the KPU declared the elected couple Jokowi - Jusuf Kalla the winner on July 22, 2014. Only then were Jokowi and Jusuf Kalla inaugurated on October 20, 2014.Even though there was only a three-month gap, issues arose primarily related to the transition team. At that time, SBY reprimanded the Jokowi-Jusuf Kalla government transition team for going directly to each ministry without any coordination. The proposed transition concept, according to SBY, does not mean the creation of two joint governments during the leadership transition period.\"The current government is the United Indonesian Cabinet II (KIB II) government following the 2009 general elections. Until October 20, 2014, I am responsible for the government,\" SBY said at a plenary cabinet meeting at the Presidential Palace. , Friday September 5, 2014.Jokowi learned lessons from unpleasant experiences when he came to power. SBY's transfer of power in 2014, Jokowi said, required a year and a half of consolidation. The reason is that SBY does not want to be harassed at the end of his term. For this reason, Jokowi allowed Prabowo to transition to work immediately after his inauguration.\"In 2014, it took me a year to a year and a half to consolidate, which means that a year to six months of our time (to work) was lost. \"For this reason, I am very happy that This government transition process only takes 12 days to go well and run smoothly,\" Jokowi said in his speech at the BNI daily summit on Tuesday, October 8, 2024.Jokowi said an effective and smooth government transition was important to maintain optimism and stability, both political and economic. Prabowo will replace Jokowi when he is inaugurated by the MPR on October 20, 2024. Prabowo will be confirmed as president along with Vice President-elect Gibran Rakabuming Raka, Jokowi's son.",

    "title": "President of the United States: Andrew Johnson, the accidental US president post-Civil War",
    "content": "Editor's Note: This is part of a series of profiles taking a closer look at US presidents ahead of the 2024 presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.Andrew Johnson, the 17th president of the United States, ascended to the presidency following the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.A Southerner and a Democrat who remained loyal to the Union during the Civil War, Johnson faced the daunting task of leading the country during the tumultuous period of Reconstruction.His lenient approach to reuniting the nation and his clashes with Radical Republicans in Congress led to the first impeachment of a US president. Despite his controversial presidency, Johnson's time in office played a critical role in shaping post-war America.Early life and rise in politicsAndrew Johnson was born on December 29, 1808, in Raleigh, North Carolina, into a poor family. Orphaned at a young age, he received no formal education and was apprenticed to a tailor at age 10.However, Johnson taught himself to read and write and eventually became involved in local politics. In 1826, he moved to Greeneville, Tennessee, where he started his own tailor shop.Johnson married Eliza McCardle in 1827, and the couple had five children: Martha, Charles, Mary, Robert, and Andrew Jr. Eliza played a quiet but supportive role throughout Johnson's political career, although she was in poor health during his presidency.Johnson's political career began in 1829 when he was elected alderman in Greeneville. He quickly moved up the ranks, becoming mayor of Greeneville, a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives, and later serving in both the Tennessee Senate and the US House of Representatives.A champion of the common man, Johnson advocated for populist policies and opposed the interests of wealthy Southern elites, gaining a reputation as a defender of poor white farmers.In 1853, Johnson was elected Governor of Tennessee, where he focused on policies benefiting the working class, such as expanding public education.In 1857, he became a US senator, aligning himself with Southern Democrats who supported states' rights but opposed secession.Civil War and the US vice presidencyWhen the Civil War broke out in 1861, Johnson remained loyal to the Union, making him a unique figure in the South. As a US senator, he was the only Southern senator who refused to join the Confederacy.His loyalty earned him national recognition, and in 1862, US President Lincoln appointed him as Military Governor of Tennessee after Union forces regained control of the state. In this role, Johnson supported Lincoln's efforts to reunite the country and restore Southern states to the Union.In 1864, Lincoln, seeking to broaden his appeal to Southern Unionists and to signal a desire for reconciliation, selected Johnson, a Democrat, as his vice-presidential running mate.The Lincoln-Johnson ticket won the election, but Johnson's role as vice president was short-lived. Just six weeks into his second term, Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth on April 14, 1865, thrusting Johnson into the presidency.Johnson presidencyAndrew Johnson became president at one of the most challenging times in US history. The Civil War had ended, but the country was deeply divided, and the South lay in ruins. Johnson's main task was overseeing the Reconstruction of the Southern states and their reintegration into the Union.Johnson's approach to Reconstruction was lenient and conciliatory toward the former Confederate states. He implemented a plan known as Presidential Reconstruction, which allowed Southern states to rejoin the Union relatively easily.Johnson granted pardons to many former Confederate leaders and permitted the Southern states to form new governments with minimal interference from the federal government.His plan did not include significant protections for the newly freed African Americans, and Southern states quickly enacted Black Codes -- laws that severely restricted the rights of African Americans.Johnson's leniency toward the South and his opposition to civil rights for freed slaves put him at odds with the Radical Republicans in Congress, who sought to impose stricter conditions on the South and ensure the civil and political rights of African Americans.This conflict led to a power struggle between the executive and legislative branches.First impeachment in American historyJohnson's presidency is most famously remembered for his impeachment -- the first in American history.The conflict between Johnson and the Radical Republicans came to a head over the Tenure of Office Act, a law passed by US Congress in 1867 to restrict the president's power to remove certain officeholders without Senate approval.When Johnson attempted to fire US Secretary of War Edwin M Stanton, a Radical Republican ally, he violated the Tenure of Office Act.In response, the House of Representatives impeached Johnson on February 24, 1868, charging him with \"high crimes and misdemeanours.\" The trial moved to the Senate, where Johnson narrowly avoided removal from office by a single vote.Johnson's presidency was severely weakened by the impeachment trial, and he had little influence over policy for the remainder of his term.Johnson's domestic and foreign policyWhile Johnson's Reconstruction policies dominated his presidency, his administration also dealt with foreign and domestic affairs.One of the key achievements of his presidency was the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867, negotiated by US Secretary of State William H Seward. The acquisition was initially ridiculed as \"Seward's Folly\" but later proved to be a valuable addition to the United States.Domestically, Johnson attempted to veto several key pieces of legislation aimed at protecting African American rights, including the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Reconstruction Acts.However, Congress overrode his vetoes, and these laws laid the foundation for greater federal intervention in the South to enforce civil rights.Johnson post-presidency and legacyAfter his term ended in 1869, Johnson returned to Tennessee, where he remained active in politics. In 1875, he became the only former president to be elected to the US Senate, a testament to his enduring popularity in his home state.However, his time in the Senate was short-lived, as he died just a few months after taking office, on July 31, 1875, at the age of 66.Andrew Johnson's legacy is a subject of intense debate. His efforts to quickly reunify the country after the Civil War were overshadowed by his failure to protect the rights of newly freed African Americans and his lenient policies toward the former Confederacy.His presidency, marked by impeachment and conflict with Congress, is often seen as one of the most tumultuous in American history.Johnson was known for his simple, rustic background and his deep connection to his roots in Tennessee, a factor that influenced his political views and approach to governance.Despite his contentious presidency, Johnson's rise from poverty to the nation's highest office remains an extraordinary American story.",

    "content": "By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.HBO host Bill Maher suggested that Vice President Kamala Harris' prospects for winning the 2024 presidential election aren't looking too good less than a month out from Nov. 5.During Friday's episode of \"Real Time with Bill Maher,\" the comedian commented on the state of the race, declaring that the fact that the Democratic Party is having to prod Black men into supporting Harris is a bad sign.\"And I gotta say it's not looking that great for the Democrats,\" he said at the start of his show Friday night.KELLYANNE CONWAY: TRUMP VS. HARRIS: DON'T RULE OUT A 'NARROW LANDSLIDE'He continued, \"This is not a good sign, you know - when you have an African American candidate, you probably shouldn't be having to shore up your support among Black men, but that's what's going on.\"Harris' challenges with appealing to Black male voters were especially pronounced this week when former President Barack Obama ripped into Black men during a campaign stop in Pittsburgh for not being as enthusiastic about Harris' presidential bid as they were for his 2008 and 2012 political campaigns.\"We have not yet seen the same kinds of energy and turnout in all corners of our neighborhoods and communities as we saw when I was running,\" he said, elsewhere adding, \"I'm speaking to men directly -- part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.\"On his program, Maher mocked the fact that the campaign is going to deploy Harris' running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., to speak to Black male voters directly.\"Tim Walz is headlining a voter engagement event tonight with Black men. Who better to connect with young Black men than Tim Walz?\" he asked.\"Because apparently Michael Bublé was unavailable,\" he quipped to raucous laughter.BATTLEGROUND DEM WARNS TRADITIONAL VOTING BLOC BEING 'SPLIT' IN 2024He added another punchline: \"Meanwhile, Kim Kardashian's like, 'Hello?'\"Maher then brought up Obama's recent comments, saying, \"Obama even came out yesterday to scold. You know, he was scolding. Well, I don't know - last month at the convention, he was, 'No scolding!' Now he's scolding. He was saying, 'You gotta vote for Harris.'\"He concluded the point with one last joke, stating, \"But of course for some young - especially the younger Black men - it's tough choice. Harris is African American but Trump has a sneaker line.\"Later during the episode, Maher spoke to his guest panel, including conservative commentator Buck Sexton and CNN host Laura Coates, about the Harris campaign's problems more generally.Reading from recent report on Harris' polling, he said, \"At this point in 2020, Biden - with far fewer resources than Harris has - was ten points ahead of Trump, and in 2016, Hillary was six up. And she is only 2.6 up. Pennsylvania - Biden was up seven at this point. She's up one. Michigan - Biden was up eight and she's tied.\"",

Simmons. \"She possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.\"VP HARRIS RELEASING DETAILED MEDICAL REPORT, CHALLENGING TRUMP TO DO THE SAMEAdvisers to Harris encouraged her office to release her medical history and health information to put a spotlight on Trump's health and mental acuity, since the 78-year-old Republican nominee would be the oldest president at the end of his potential second term, according to a senior aide.President Biden, 81, withdrew from the 2024 presidential election in July amid pressure from the Democratic Party given concerns over his advanced age and visible fatigue. Since then, Democrats have sought to go on offense against Trump with what was once their election vulnerability.During an August interview with CBS News, Trump insisted that he would \"gladly\" release his medical records, noting at the time that he had a \"perfect score\" on a recent medical exam. He has not yet done so.The letter from Dr. Simmons calls Harris' most recent medical exam in April 2024 \"unremarkable.\" The vice president has no major health issues and \"maintains a healthy, active lifestyle despite her busy schedule,\" including daily exercise. Harris eats a \"very healthy diet,\" does not smoke and drinks \"only occasionally and in moderation,\" according to her doctor.TOP 5 FRIENDLIEST MOMENTS FROM KAMALA HARRIS' MEDIA BLITZ: 'THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES'\"Vice President Harris is a healthy 59-year-old female who has a medical history notable for seasonal allergies and urticaria,\" the letter states. Urticaria is a common skin condition that can cause itchy, red raised bumps or welts to appear on the skin. It can be triggered by certain foods, medications or stress. Harris takes Allegra to manage her allergies and urticaria, and for the past three years she has undergone allergen immunotherapy (ATI).Other details from the report include that Harris is nearsighted and wears corrective contact lenses, that she has a family history of colon cancer (her mother died of colon cancer in 2009) and that she is \"up to date on all preventative care recommendations, including colonoscopy and annual mammograms.\"WHY TRUMP IS HEADED INTO 'THE BELLY OF THE BEAST': THE STREATEGY BEHIND HIS BLUE STATE STOPSThe decision to release Harris' medical information comes after a New York Times report asserted that Trump has not been transparent with his own health, even after a would-be assassin's bullet grazed his head at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania this past July.Trump did not release his medical records in his first White House campaign in 2016, the report notes. Neither did the Trump White House release accurate updates on his condition after a 2020 COVID diagnosis, with reports detailing that the president was more sick than his doctors said in public, according to the report.\"In 2024, days before becoming the official Republican presidential nominee for the third time, he was grazed by a would-be assassin's bullet, yet his campaign did not hold a briefing on his condition, release hospital records or make the emergency physicians who treated him available for interview,\" the report said. It goes on to quote several medical experts who raise concerns that Trump could enter the Oval Office in a second term with several \"potentially worrisome issues.\"\nThe last health update from Trump came in November 2023, when his personal doctor, Bruce Aronwald, said in a letter Trump's \"overall health is excellent.\"\"His physical exams were well within the normal range and his cognitive exams were exceptional,\" Aronwald wrote.In response to a request for comment, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung pointed to the letter released by Aronwald and reports from former White House doctor Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, who treated Trump after the failed assassination attempt in Pennsylvania.\"President Trump has voluntarily released updates from his personal physician, as well as detailed reports from Dr. Ronny Jackson who treated him after the first assassination attempt,\" Cheung said.\"All have concluded he is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief. He has maintained an extremely busy and active campaign schedule unlike any other in political history, whereas Kamala Harris has been unable to keep up with the demands of campaigning and reveals on a daily basis she is wholly unqualified to be President of the United States. Her schedule is much lighter because, it is said, she does not have the stamina of President Trump. Polls are reflective of this.\"",

    "content": "Recent data suggests that Vice President Kamala Harris may carry a slimmer majority of the Black vote in the 2024 presidential election than previously anticipated.The New York Times acknowledged on Saturday that Harris has significant work to do in the next few weeks if she's going to achieve the same level of Black support as previous Democrat presidential candidates.In 2016, Hillary Clinton pulled 92% of the Black vote. In 2020, President Joe Biden pulled a smaller but still commanding 90%. According to the most recent NY Times/Sienna college poll from last week, Harris is only earning 78% support among Black voters. Over the last eight years, Black support for the Republican candidate has more than doubled since 2016 and currently stands at 15%.The steady drift of Black voters away from the Democratic Party can be traced to decades of taking the demographic for granted. The outlet spoke to Black Trump supporters who said that many have grown weary of the Democrats consistent playing of the \"race card\" while their neighborhoods and incomes degrade under Democratic Party rule.\"They sweep table scraps off the table like we're a trained dog and say, 'This is for you,'\" LaPage Drake, 63, of Cedar Hill, Texas, just outside Dallas, said of the Democratic Party. \"And we clap like trained seals.\"Mr. Drake, who owns a tree removal service, said he would back Mr. Trump. \"Regardless of how people call him racist and stuff, he is for the country of America,\" Mr. Drake said.Harris has attempted to do a better job of outreach to the younger Black male vote, touring historically Black colleges and universities and scheduling a town hall style event next week with popular podcast \"The Breakfast Club.\"The poll noted that 75% of Black voters feel Harris would do a better job of handling issues important to them than Trump. Yet that still leaves 17% who feel Trump would do a better job, a colossal jump from when the former president first ran eight years ago.The NY Times/Sienna poll surveyed 589 Black voters from Sept 29.

    "content": "With three-and-a-half weeks until Election Day, former President Trump is holding a rally in Southern California on Saturday.His campaign also announced this week that the Republican presidential nominee will hold a rally in New York City's Madison Square Garden later this month.On Friday, Trump stopped in Colorado, and on Tuesday he's scheduled to parachute into Illinois.It's been 40 years since a Republican carried New York in a presidential election, 36 years since California and Illinois went red in a White House race, and two decades since the GOP captured Colorado.The Closer: Former President Obama Hits The Trail For Harris In The Closing StretchWith time an extremely precious commodity for the presidential campaigns in the final stretch of a White House showdown in a margin-of-error race with Vice President Kamala Harris, many are wondering why Trump is stopping in blue states, which his chances of carrying are extremely slim to nonexistent.\n\"We just rented Madison Square Garden. We're going to make a play. We're going to make a play for New York. Hasn't been done in a long time. It hasn't been done in many decades,\" Trump said at a rally in Pennsylvania this week, hours after his campaign announced the New York City date.Check Out The Latest Fox News Polling In The 2024 Election\"We're making a play for New Jersey. We're making a play for Virginia,\" Trump continued, before adding that he's also aiming to compete in Minnesota and New Mexico.Despite the former president's bravado about expanding the electoral map, the latest Fox News Power Rankings in the 2024 presidential election rank New York, New Jersey, California and Colorado as solid Democrat, with Minnesota, New Mexico and Virginia as likely blue.Trump on Saturday will headline a rally in Coachella, a city in California's Riverside County southeast of Palm Springs that's best known nationally for a music festival that takes place nearby every April.\"President Trump's visit to Coachella will highlight Harris' poor record and show that he has the right solutions for every state and every American,\" Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement.The stop in Coachella may also benefit Trump with Latino voters -- who have been trending towards the GOP in recent years -- not only in southeast California, but more importantly in neighboring Arizona and Nevada, two of the seven crucial battleground states that will likely determine if the former president or Harris wins the 2024 election.Click Here For The Latest Fox News Power RankingsTrump's rally in Madison Square Garden on Oct. 27 will be his third major campaign event in Democrat-dominated New York this year.Last month, he packed the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, just outside of New York City. And he attracted thousands at a rally in NYC's borough of The Bronx in May.He also held a large rally in May along the shore in New Jersey.\"Choosing high-impact settings makes it so the media can't look away and refuse to cover the issues and the solutions President Trump is offering,\" a senior Trump campaign adviser told Fox News when asked about the strategy of holding October events in blue states. \"We live in a nationalized media environment and the national media's attention on these large-scale, outside-the-norm settings increases the reach of his message across the country and penetrates in every battleground state.\"Longtime Republican strategist Jesse Hunt, a veteran of multiple GOP presidential campaigns, noted that these stops in blue states are less about geography and more about the message.\"Trump is creating a lot of unique and interesting contrast situations that can then be beamed into a mass audience in states that they care about,\" Hunt said. \"You have to create compelling narratives, compelling contrasts. I think that's part of what Trump is doing.\"Hunt argued that Trump is a pro \"at creating these moments that penetrate our fractured media environment\" and that \"voters in Georgia, voters in North Carolina, are certainly going to consume news about Trump's event in Madison Square Garden.\"Pointing to veteran campaign strategists Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles, who are steering Trump's 2024 campaign, Hunt said they're \"a pretty smart team... and they're not going to waste his time.\"Seasoned Republican strategist Matthew Bartlett agreed that \"we are at a point where everything is nationalized.\"He argued that the Trump blue state events \"will spin an entire news cycle. It will give his supporters talking points. And I think there's admiration of going into the belly of the beast, to going into your opponent's territory.\"Bartlett added that \"of course, there's a downside.\"\"In the waning days, if this strategy proves ineffective, it could be similar to what Hillary Clinton did, which was mismanaged her time in the last few days of 2016, by not being in the critical swing states, not being in places where you have to drive turnout,\" he warned.",

    "title": "Real World Economics: Wanted: Political cover for the inevitable",
    "content": "As the 2024 presidential election campaign nears its end, an eerie aura pervades public discourse: Our nation is sleep-walking towards an economic crisis, yet neither candidate mentions, much less explores, the key problems that imperil us.Such studied ignorance is a measure of the brokenness of our nation's politics. Perhaps it is time for a high-powered national commission that could break the deadlock.The basic issue is that federal finances have been on an unsustainable course for 24 years. Annual federal deficits and the accumulated national debt grow larger and larger relative to what we produce.Economic history and comparative politics, not to mention common sense, tell us that at some point our lenders will stop taking IOUs. Taxes will have to be raised sharply. If some of those to whom we have promised payments are stiffed, the national economy will be thrown into crisis. And, given its status as the center of the global economy, that would mean a worldwide economic debacle as that which ensued after 1929.Yet politically, touching this third-rail could send shockwaves through markets. So we pretend it doesn't exist. But it does.There are two fundamental problems.First, total federal tax revenue relative to the total value of our nation's production are well below where they were in the last four fiscal years of the Clinton administration. That period, 1997-2001, was the last era in which our finances were comparatively sound.Secondly, the retirement of baby boomers and increases in the costs and panoply of medical treatments are blowing up our biggest spending programs, Medicare and Social Security, whose universal benefits are mandated by statute.How did we get here?On the tax revenue side, after a dizzying decade of tax rate fluctuations during the Reagan years, Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton asked for, and Congress passed, moderate tax increases. By 1997, these produced overall revenues greater than overall outlays. It seemed that sanity had returned to government. Not coincidentally, the eight Clinton years had the fastest average growth in inflation-adjusted GDP since the 1960s, a rate nearly twice as high as over the 23 years since. We threw that sustainability away with tax cuts in 2001, 2003 and 2017.And on the expenditure side, growing outlays in mandatory spending for Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and Supplemental Security income, along with defense spending for wars in the Mideast, caused budget deficits to spiral out of control.Any solution to the deficits that have grown inexorably since then must include restoring taxes to the relative levels we had in the decade up to 2001 as well as overhauls of the big mandatory spending programs. Yet except for a few politicians from both parties who are bold enough to suggest raising the retirement ages for Social Security, no one advocates major overhauls of that program or Medicare or Medicaid. Most dangerously, no one dares mention the obvious need for taxes to go up.Democratic Vice President Walter Mondale had done that in 1984 when running for president against Ronald Reagan. His stating the obvious in a speech killed his candidacy. George H.W. Bush, doing what clearly was needed, killed his reelection. So the subject has been political anathema for a third of a century.Responsible GOP officials understand budget and deficit realities. They know realistic tax rates must return. But none will give voice to reality without any political cover.That brings us to the tried and true political ploy of the blue-ribbon national commission.When some issue is so fraught with controversy that elected officials dare not touch it themselves, a bipartisan set of safely retired public figures can read reports, hear testimony and hash over alternatives before issuing a useful compromise report. This is politically safe. It sometimes is effective.Results are mixed. President Lyndon Johnson appointed such a commission headed by Chief Justice Earl Warren to investigate the killing of John F. Kennedy. Their report created as many questions as it answered.In 1967, Johnson named another commission, headed by Illinois Gov. Otto Kerner, to investigate the causes of rioting and civil unrest. The Kerner Commission report was a definitive milepost in understanding racial discrimination, injustice and poverty. It remains a vital document for understanding our nation's history.Ronald Reagan asked his Attorney General Ed Meese to lead a panel investigating pornography and its effects. The report is largely forgotten.But Reagan also appointed soon-to-be Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan to lead another commission, one charged with putting Social Security on a sustainable footing in the face of the then-foreseen demographic stresses from the baby boom cohort. The results were generally good, even if subsequent Congresses perverted key recommendations, thus creating the problems we face now.George W. Bush appointed a commission headed by New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean to investigate the 9/11 attacks. Its 585-page report was generally good and fostered useful changes in government structure and procedures. But his later panel to look at partial or full privatization of Social Security was a dud.So history is a mixed bag, but the option should be explored. There also is an economic argument for appointing such panels to supplement politics-as-usual.Tangentially, it is one suggested by the work of Jon Elster, a Norwegian philosopher and political thinker. Starting as a Marxist theoretician, Elster's thought broadened. He co-created \"rational choice theory\" and is one of the founders of behavioral economics, a discipline for which Israeli-American psychologist Daniel Kahneman got the Economics Nobel Prize in 2002.One topic on Elster's broad palette of work is that of creating constraints to motivate desired behaviors under stress. An example comes from the myth of Ulysses and the Sirens. Ulysses and his war-worn crew wanted to get home after years of war. But their course led them past Sirens, goddesses whose irresistibly beautiful singing lured mariners and their boats onto rocks. Ulysses yearned to hear their fabled singing. He had his crew lash him to the mast and then plug their own ears. Unable to hear the seductive music, they rowed and steered for home. Ulysses, roped to the spar, could not grab the helm to steer a suicidal course. So he enjoyed the chorus while the ship reached home safely.Sensible politicians from both parties know that restoring U.S. federal finances to stability must include some tax increases as a key component. But political Siren songs tempt them to do otherwise. They need a mast to which they can be bound to resist resorting to campaign demagoguery that dooms reform. A well-structured blue-ribbon commission could provide such a mast, such a prudent restraint.Who would be on it? Health permitting, how about retired New Jersey Republican Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and retired Oklahoma Democratic Gov. David Boren as co-chairs? Martin Feldstein and Alan Greenspan as Republican government finance economists with Joel Slemrod and Len Burman as Democrats. Former Senate majority leaders Democrat Tom Daschle and Republican Bill Frist? Former Treasury Secretaries Larry Summers and Henry Paulson? Nebraskan ex-senators Bob Kerry and Chuck Hagel? Retired Judges J. Michael Luttig and Richard Posner? Politicos can go on with pairings of respected and experienced moderates roughly balanced between the two parties including politicians, administrators and scholars.Make the panel large enough so that there can be working groups tasked with taxes, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and so on. Give them an ample budget for full-time researchers and open hearings around the country. Ask them to report back in 18 months. The goal? Providing political cover for the inevitable recommendations that tax increases or restorations plus cuts in spending must play a part in avoiding consequential fiscal disaster -- coupled with the very real conclusion, with examples, that without action, disaster is unavoidable.It is impossible to say if such a commission would be fruitful and the Kerner and Greenspan commissions were, or duds like those tasked with pornography and Social Security privatization. But open hearings and interim reports to Congress might create space for more honesty and less demagoguery on the part of people still holding elective office. There is little to be lost and possibly much to be gained.",

    "title": "Presidents of the United States: Ulysses S Grant, the US soldier-president",
    "content": "Editor's Note: This profile is part of a series taking a closer look at US presidents ahead of the 2024 presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.Ulysses S Grant, the 18th president of the United States, is remembered for his military prowess as the Union general who led the North to victory during the Civil War and his two terms as president during one of the nation's most challenging periods, Reconstruction.His presidency, while marked by efforts to heal the nation and promote civil rights for African Americans, was also marred by corruption scandals within his administration.Despite the controversies, Grant's dedication to preserving the Union and promoting equality has secured his legacy as a significant figure in American history.Military careerHiram Ulysses Grant was born on April 27, 1822, in Point Pleasant, Ohio, to a family of modest means. He was the eldest of six children born to Jesse and Hannah Grant. His father worked as a tanner, and although Ulysses disliked the work, his father pushed him toward education.At 17, Grant entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, where an error in his paperwork listed his name as Ulysses S Grant. He accepted the name change, later joking that the \"S\" stood for nothing.Grant graduated from West Point in 1843, ranking 21st in a class of 39. He served with distinction during the Mexican-American War under General Zachary Taylor and General Winfield Scott. Grant saw combat in several key battles and gained valuable military experience.Grant married Julia Dent in 1848, and the couple had four children: Frederick, Ulysses Jr, Nellie, and Jesse. Julia was a steadfast companion throughout Grant's military and political career, and the couple shared a close relationship.After Grant's death, Julia remained active in promoting his legacy and lived until 1902. The Grant family has continued to hold an important place in American history, with several of his descendants engaging in public service.After the war, however, he struggled with boredom in peacetime assignments, leading to a brief resignation from the army in 1854.For several years, Grant lived in relative obscurity, working as a farmer and a clerk to support his family. He faced financial difficulties and struggled to find success in civilian life. However, the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861 would change the course of his life.Civil War leadership and rise to fameWith the start of the Civil War, Grant rejoined the army, initially serving as a colonel of the 21st Illinois Infantry Regiment. His decisive and bold leadership soon earned him promotions, and he became known for his willingness to take the fight to Confederate forces.His early victories at Fort Henry and Fort Donelson in 1862 gave the Union much-needed momentum in the Western Theater of the war. After the Battle of Fort Donelson, Grant's demand for \"unconditional surrender\" from the Confederates earned him national fame and the nickname \"Unconditional Surrender Grant.\"In 1863, Grant's military career reached new heights with his brilliant campaign to capture Vicksburg, a Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River. The victory at Vicksburg was a turning point in the war, splitting the Confederacy in two and solidifying Grant's reputation as the Union's most effective general. Later, Grant led Union forces to victory in pivotal battles such as Chattanooga.In 1864, US President Abraham Lincoln appointed Grant as General-in-Chief of all Union armies, and he directed the Overland Campaign against General Robert E Lee's forces in Virginia.His relentless strategy, though costly in terms of casualties, ultimately led to the surrender of Lee at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865, effectively ending the Civil War.Presidency: Challenges of ReconstructionGrant's military heroism made him a national icon, and in 1868, he was elected as the 18th President of the United States. He ran as the Republican candidate, advocating for the continued protection of African American civil rights and a strong Reconstruction policy in the South.His campaign slogan, \"Let us have peace,\" captured the public's desire for unity and healing after the war.As president, Grant worked to enforce the Reconstruction Acts, ensuring that former Confederate states adhered to federal laws and provided civil rights to newly freed African Americans.He was a staunch supporter of the 15th Amendment, which granted African American men the right to vote, and used federal troops to suppress violent white supremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan. Under his administration, the Department of Justice was established in 1870 to protect civil rights and combat racial violence in the South.Despite his commitment to civil rights, Grant's presidency was marred by widespread corruption scandals. Although Grant himself was known for his personal integrity, many of his political appointees were involved in bribery, fraud, and other illegal activities.The Credit Mobilier scandal, the Whiskey Ring, and other episodes damaged his administration's reputation. Grant's loyalty to friends and associates often prevented him from addressing the corruption more effectively.Grant's struggles in officeIn foreign policy, Grant's administration sought to strengthen America's international standing. His efforts to annex the Dominican Republic were unsuccessful, but he successfully resolved a long-standing dispute with Great Britain over damages caused by British-built Confederate ships, leading to the Treaty of Washington in 1871.The treaty improved relations between the two countries and established a precedent for peaceful arbitration of international disputes.However, economic difficulties also plagued Grant's presidency. The Panic of 1873, a severe financial depression, led to widespread unemployment and suffering.The economic downturn eroded support for Reconstruction, as many Northern voters turned their attention to their own financial struggles, leaving Southern African Americans more vulnerable to discrimination and violence.A post-presidency world-tourAfter leaving office in 1877, Grant embarked on a two-year world tour with his wife, Julia Dent Grant, visiting Europe, Asia, and Africa. Upon returning to the United States, Grant's reputation was restored to some degree, and he was welcomed as a national hero.However, financial misfortune struck the Grants again when a business partnership in which Grant invested heavily went bankrupt due to his partner's embezzlement.To support his family, Grant began writing his memoirs, which were published by Mark Twain. His memoirs, completed just days before his death, became a literary success and are still regarded as one of the best presidential autobiographies.Grant died on July 23, 1885, from throat cancer at the age of 63. His funeral was a national event, and he was laid to rest in Grant's Tomb in New York City, the largest mausoleum in North America.Legacy of Ulysses S GrantUlysses S Grant's legacy is complex. As a general, he is remembered as one of the most effective military leaders in American history, whose strategy and determination helped preserve the Union.As a president, his administration's achievements in protecting African American civil rights during Reconstruction were groundbreaking, even as his presidency was tainted by scandals.In recent years, historians have reevaluated Grant's presidency, acknowledging his commitment to civil rights and his role in shaping post-Civil War America.Despite the scandals, Grant's dedication to equality and justice, both as a soldier and a president, remains a significant part of his legacy.",

    "content": "Stevie Wonder has endorsed Kamala Harris in her bid to become the next US president.Harris, who is currently serving as vice president under Joe Biden, is running against Republican candidate Donald Trump, with voting set to take place on 5 November.Wonder, the legendary musician behind hits such as \"Superstition\" and \"Sir Duke\", recorded a video with filmmaker Spike Lee in which he throws his support behind Harris.In a clip shared to X/Twitter by Harris's team, Wonder can be seen speaking about his relationship with Harris.\"I was excited about Kamala years before people knew who she was,\" the 74-year-old musician says. \"I'm very happy for the future.

    "title": "How Did Immigration Politics Get So Toxic?",
    "content": "How Did Immigration Politics Get So Toxic?Fiona HarriganOctober 12, 2024 at 12:00 PMIn April 1980, two candidates were leading the race for the Republican presidential nomination -- Ronald Reagan, who went on to win the election, and George H.W. Bush, who became his vice president. They participated in a presidential forum that month in Houston, and the very first question from the border-state audience touched on the topic of illegal immigration.\"Do you think the children of illegal aliens should be allowed to attend the Texas public schools free,\" asked the questioner, \"or do you think that their parents should pay for their education?\"The problem of illegal immigration \"has to be solved,\" Bush replied. But because \"we have kind of made illegal some kinds of labor that I'd like to see legal,\" he continued, \"we are creating a whole society of really honorable, decent, family-loving people that are in violation of the law.\"\"Why don't we work out some recognition of our mutual problems , make it possible for them to come here legally with a work permit, and then, while they're working and earning here, they pay taxes here?\" Reagan pitched. \"And when they want to go back, they can go back. And they can cross. And open the border both ways by understanding their problems.\"Compare that exchange to the current state of America's border politics. The Republican Party's official platform calls for the deportation of \"millions\" of illegal migrants and the implementation of \"strict vetting\" to \"keep foreign Christian-hating Communists, Marxists, and Socialists out of America.\" It refers to an ongoing \"migrant invasion\" that must be stopped, including through means as drastic as stationing troops along the southern border.Democrats, never consistent doves on the border, have also warmed to more restrictionist policies in the lead-up to the 2024 election. They rallied behind a bill that would have significantly restricted access to the asylum process and given the president the power to \"shut down\" the border when crossings hit a certain number. Before dropping out of the race, President Joe Biden touted executive actions he took to button up the border -- a stark contrast to his more humane-sounding promises as the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate.Many of the loudest voices in the conversation defend their volume by saying the border has never been this chaotic, insecure, or porous. It's true that border apprehensions (arrests of migrants crossing into the country illegally) are shattering records. It's also true that asylum courts are severely backlogged, cities and states are struggling to accommodate newcomers, and the media paint the borderlands as a region in crisis. It's easy to simply blame the most recent president for whatever is going wrong at the border.But none of that fully explains why the U.S. is so bad at handling this issue at this specific moment, and why it seems like border politics have never been more toxic.Border management and border rhetoric have hit crisis levels because the nation's policy tools were designed to handle completely different migration patterns than we see today. Congress hasn't meaningfully updated the nation's immigration system in more than 40 years. During that time, border crossers have shifted from being mostly single adult Mexican male laborers to a patchwork of children, adults, and families coming from more than 150 countries for a variety of reasons. The situation has changed dramatically, but politicians keep using 1980s tools to address 2020s problems without considering why they're not working.Border crackdowns feel like an easy solution to something that touches so many complex policy issues, from drug overdoses to national security to economic worries. It's no wonder that the 2024 presidential election has increasingly turned into a referendum on who has the most hawkish bona fides. But as voters and politicians become more and more inflexible in their views on what can and should happen at the border, the situation there -- and the debate around it -- will only get worse.A Different EraIn the years following Bush and Reagan's 1980 exchange, unauthorized migration along the U.S.-Mexico border grew more common and visible. By the middle of the decade, apprehensions there exceeded 1 million every year.The first of two modern eras of unauthorized migration was underway. According to a January paper by the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute (MPI), this period extended from the 1980s to the early 2010s, and \"the border security approach that emerged during this period reflected the characteristics of migrants crossing the border at the time.\"Back then, \"the Southwest border was a question of Mexican migrants coming from a contiguous country, typically single young males looking to work in the United States and looking to avoid being arrested or being apprehended by the Border Patrol,\" says Doris Meissner, a senior fellow at the MPI who served as commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) under President Bill Clinton. \"Up until probably 2014, 97 to 98 percent of crossings at the southwest border were from Mexico.\"By 1984, Reagan agreed that \"our borders are out of control.\" The perception of violence and disorder in the border region in the '70s and '80s led Congress and the executive branch to reconsider how the U.S. should handle border enforcement and the country's unauthorized migrant population, culminating in the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA).Like many of today's border bills, the IRCA focused primarily on illegal immigration. Unlike many of today's border bills, it was a bipartisan compromise. It punished U.S. employers for hiring undocumented immigrants and it increased Border Patrol staffing, but it also legalized nearly 2.7 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States. It passed the House 238-173 and the Senate 63-24. Support and opposition didn't fall cleanly along partisan lines: Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) backed the bill, but then-Reps. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Harry Reid (D-Nev.) didn't.The law's effects were mixed. The hiring provisions proved difficult to enforce and the border security measures weren't funded until years later. Broadly taken to be a one-time measure, the amnesty was especially controversial: \"The five-year gap between the qualifying date and the date of the law's enactment left many settled immigrants in the country without status, and critics charged that the law increased the incentive for people to migrate in hopes of future amnesties,\" the MPI noted in 2011.\"Thus,\" says the more recent MPI report, \"the act ultimately came to generate political controversy for granting immigration benefits to large numbers of people who had entered the United States illegally, while not achieving the 'border control' it promised.\"Border talk got tougher in the 1990s. \"All Americans,\" Clinton argued in his 1995 State of the Union address, \"are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country.\" The administration, he continued, had \"moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens.\"Those talking points sound just like the ones we hear today, but this was all happening against the backdrop of a more manageable migration pattern: By and large, young single men were coming from Mexico to look for work in the United States. That made enforcement pretty straightforward in the government's eyes. Throughout the 1990s, the U.S. and Mexico began to collaborate more on border security. The Clinton administration surged personnel and resources to the border, spent billions on migrant detection and removal efforts, and ushered in a 1996 law that created the modern deportation apparatus. That law passed both chambers of Congress by wide margins.\"The '96 bill was mostly a partisan bill, that in its final form dealt only with illegal immigration,\" says National Foundation for American Policy Executive Director Stuart Anderson, who served as executive associate commissioner for policy and planning and counselor to the commissioner at the INS under President George W. Bush. \"Supporters of that bill had tried to also cut legal immigration, but there had been a strong pushback and a coalition...prevented the cuts in legal immigration.\"Border enforcement began to change dramatically in the new millennium. In FY 2000, border apprehensions hit a then-historic high of 1.6 million. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks of 2001, Bush temporarily closed U.S. borders. The investigations that followed the attacks revealed gaps in the government's border management apparatus and raised questions about who, exactly, was crossing the border. \"Border security,\" says the MPI, \"became a key focus of the domestic policy response to 9/11.\"That response produced many tools and practices that politicians now see as essential pieces of border management. \"It became impossible to have a liberalizing immigration legislation go through Congress,\" says Anderson. \"Everything became focused on more anti-terrorism and more security.\" Lawmakers laid the groundwork for the Border Patrol staff and budget to become huge. The Bush administration deployed the National Guard to the border. Federal agencies began to use militaristic surveillance tools, including drones and aerostats (tethered airships), to monitor the borderlands.In 2006, the Secure Fence Act authorized and partially funded the construction of border fencing. It also set a standard that continues to distort expectations for border management: It defined \"operational control\" of the border as \"the prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States.\"The bill was unlike today's efforts in two key ways. First, it had strong bipartisan support. It passed the Senate 80-19, with 25 Democratic senators -- including Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton -- voting yes. Second, it passed with that Mexico-focused enforcement goal in mind.Both factors help explain why lawmakers were willing to tackle immigration reform at the same time. Those reform efforts \"reflected a centrist consensus around addressing three main elements of the immigration enterprise: further growth of border security resources, a path to citizenship for unauthorized migrants already in the country, and the establishment of a guest worker program for Mexican seasonal workers,\" according to the MPI. A reform bill introduced by Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) died; so did one from Sens. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.).The government never fully stopped migration during the first era of border enforcement, but it developed partially effective tactics. Most border crossers were single adults from Mexico without asylum claims to adjudicate, so it was easy simply to send them home.That all began to change in the 2010s.Changing Flows, Changing NarrativesIn 2014, Meissner notes, the number of Central Americans started to overtake the number of Mexicans. While the border was once an issue of \"single males trying to work in the United States,\" she continues, in the 2010s migrants were \"more likely unaccompanied minors and family groups and people seeking asylum.\" That meant they were looking for \"a Border Patrol agent so that they could file a claim for relief in the United States.\"In other words, we moved from a period when border crossers were predominantly people trying to avoid detection to one where most were actively trying to encounter authorities. Border crossings weren't necessarily up, but arriving migrants were suddenly coming from a larger number of countries and presenting claims for humanitarian protection, which required different legal and logistical approaches than the prior migration waves. In the MPI's framework, this was the second -- and current -- era of modern border enforcement.\"How could the U.S. border security enterprise, by then the most advanced and well-resourced in the world, face such deep difficulties with these migrants, the vast majority of whom were not seeking to evade apprehension?\" asks the MPI. \"The answer resides in the profound mismatch that has developed between the border apparatus the United States had built and this new form of mass migration.\"Rampant violence, gang activity, and political instability drove migrants to leave the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala en masse. In just three months in summer 2014, the Obama administration apprehended more than 40,000 unaccompanied children and adults traveling with kids. Many came to the U.S. to seek asylum or other protections based on persecution or other negative conditions back home.Migrants can make an asylum claim only on U.S. soil or at a port of entry, and they need to pass a \"credible fear\" test before their case can progress to an immigration court. (The \"vast majority\" of Central American migrants who came to the U.S. since 2014 have \"met the standard,\" notes the MPI.) While applicants wait for their asylum cases to be adjudicated, they're generally released into the country and allowed to attend school and find jobs.Immigration courts were already extremely backlogged before the 2014 migrant wave, but wait times became years longer as thousands of new cases joined the queue. This meant asylum seekers could spend ages building lives in the U.S. without knowing if they could stay.Meanwhile, members of Congress were giving up on the most recent meaningful effort to overhaul the nation's immigration system. The bipartisan bill produced in 2013 by the \"Gang of Eight\" -- four Republican and four Democratic senators -- was ambitious, offering a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants, expanding employment-verification measures, building out work visa programs, and bolstering border security.It's hard to say which was more representative of the long-gone mood -- a quote from one of the bill's sponsors that proclaimed 2013 \"the year of immigration reform,\" or the fact that the senator who said it was the South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham.The Gang of Eight's bill passed the Senate by a margin of 68-32, with 14 Republicans joining all 52 Democrats in voting yes. But then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) refused to take it up in his chamber. \"Border security and interior enforcement must come first,\" congressional Republicans wrote in a January 2014 statement, pushing for a \"step-by-step, common-sense approach\" instead of \"a single, massive piece of legislation.\" Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), one of the Gang of Eight, rejected the idea that Democrats would support piecemeal bills that didn't offer a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.The room for compromise began to shrink. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) lost his primary race in 2014, and his willingness to embrace immigration reform had been one point of attack for his Tea Party opponent. \"Having a compromise position doesn't necessarily benefit someone politically if they're in a district or state where their only risk is that someone can attack them for being a compromiser or not being harsh enough on immigration,\" says Anderson. \"The polarization has made compromise less likely.\" In mirror-image political obituaries, NBC called Cantor \"a casualty of immigration reform\" and Politico said Cantor's loss \"kill immigration reform.\"By the time Obama left office, border apprehensions were hovering around two-decade lows. But two things were clear: The border apparatus was faltering and political interest in fixing it was waning.'A Dumping Ground for Everybody Else's Problems'Border discourse was already falling apart at the seams, but the rise of Donald Trump ripped it apart completely.To a huge extent, Trump's political stardom was powered by the perception he helped create of a chaotic southern border. \"The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems,\" he warned in his June 2015 presidential announcement speech before offering his infamous assessment of border crossers: \"They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\"\"That difference in 'Is immigration, if we can manage it effectively, a good thing for the country or is immigration a threat to the country' -- that was a very important dividing line,\" Meissner notes.\"Whether his anti-immigration rhetoric, etc., was the reason he won is debatable,\" Anderson adds. But \"it certainly led to people feeling that it was fine to engage in that rhetoric, and that maybe it even makes you more successful.\"Once Trump became president, he did things at the border that others had long rejected because they weren't practical or legal. His administration ran with the ideas that the border was best ruled with an iron fist and that it could be tamed through brute force. The most visible example of that was the \"big, beautiful wall\" he promised on the campaign trail, which rested on the harebrained idea that it would be possible to fully barricade the rugged and hazardous 2,000-mile border between the U.S. and Mexico. The most tragic example, though, was the cruel policy to deter migration by forcibly separating thousands of children from their parents at the border.Congressional inaction on immigration helped create this situation. \"I think the fact that there hasn't been legislation has made more presidents turn to using executive authority,\" Anderson says. \"It makes sense that voters end up turning to see presidents being responsible for more things.\"Unauthorized border crossings were low early in Trump's presidency, but they began to rise again in late 2017. Like the 2014 wave, these newcomers didn't fit into the demographics that the existing border management tools had been designed for. Unaccompanied children and families arrived, as did \"caravans\" of thousands of people at a time. The challenge pushed the administration only further toward old-school methods. It \"sought to reinstate mass prosecution as a response to unauthorized migration,\" a tactic used and abandoned decades prior, reports the MPI. The result was the \"zero-tolerance\" program, \"in which all adults caught crossing the border illegally would be criminally prosecuted.\"Zero tolerance and family separations didn't change why Central Americans were fleeing, and they continued to arrive at the border. \"Paradoxically,\" the MPI observes, by 2019, \"the most border-security-focused administration in history was facing record numbers of border apprehensions.\"The Trump administration shifted the goalposts yet again in 2020. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, it started denying migrants the opportunity to apply for asylum at the border, instead expelling them to Mexico or their home countries. It carried out those expulsions by relying on a provision of public health law -- Section 265 of Title 42 -- that had been seldom used until that point. Though the public justification for the order was that migrants risked spreading COVID-19, reporting on the administration's policy discussions has made it clear that the Title 42 order was implemented for political reasons, not medical ones. Millions of migrants were expelled under the order, which remained in place under Biden until 2022. Repeat border crossings spiked.The basic expectations of what a president could and should do at the border had shifted. The bipartisan middle on the issue was fading away, as compromise became more of a political liability. Now, during times of high crossings, the general public could point to a time when the president simply \"shut down the border\" and it seemed to have worked.'What a Paralyzed Place'Given all his bluster, it's easy to forget that Trump oversaw his fair share of border chaos. The number of migrants who snuck into the country illegally without getting caught by the Border Patrol increased every year of his term, according to a Cato Institute analysis. \"Sometimes you see people believe that you can just sort of 'close the border,'\" says Anderson, \"and politicians kind of lead to that notion by saying things implying that it's just a matter of political will. Well, Trump certainly had a lot of political will, yet illegal entry, if you measure apprehensions, actually doubled from FY 2016 to FY 2019.\"The obvious lesson from the Trump years is that even the most hardcore enforcement can only go so far in the modern era. This has not been Biden's takeaway.Biden maintained much of Trump's legacy at the border as crossings rose. He kept the pandemic-era Title 42 order in place well after it was proven ineffective. He allowed border wall construction to continue in South Texas. He revived many aspects of his predecessor's \"transit ban,\" which barred migrants from applying for asylum in the U.S. if they didn't do so in another country before reaching the border.A major mistake the Biden administration made was not \"explaining to people from the beginning that this was a refugee crisis across the region,\" says Anderson. \"It basically said, 'We're going to be judged completely on the numbers.'\" Administration officials, members of Congress, and the general public have graded Biden's performance on the border against the persistent, unrealistic standards set decades prior and reawakened during the Trump years. It's no wonder he went for the outdated playbook.Earlier this year, Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), and Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.) introduced a bipartisan border bill, the most ambitious compromise effort since the Gang of Eight's failed 2013 legislation. It was tough on migrants, aiming to raise the standard for who qualified for asylum and to provide an authority for the Department of Homeland Security to \"shut down\" the border if crossings reached a certain level.When the Senate vote came, it was Democrats who rallied around the bill, in part because they wanted to gain some credibility on border security in an election year. And it was Republicans who killed it, heeding House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who promised that the bill would \"be dead on arrival\" in his chamber, and Trump, who called on Congress to reject the bill if it wasn't \"perfect.\"\"That's really an example of...what a paralyzed place we're in,\" says Meissner. \"It's the first time in 11 years that there has been a truly bipartisan effort to enact legislation and it foundered within hours of its being introduced. Over politics.\"The no voters argued that Biden had the tools to close the border without Congress' help. Biden seemingly proved their point in June when he unveiled sweeping asylum restrictions at the Mexican border, including a measure similar to the bipartisan bill's border shutdown authority. It was Trumpian logic: Do something tough at the border regardless of the legality or sensibility. Biden's order rests on legal justifications that were rebuked when Trump used them to try to back up several immigration actions, and it's already being challenged in court.There's a reason why \"border czar Kamala Harris\" has caught on as shorthand for criticizing the vice president's record now that she's the Democratic nominee for president. The phrase is rooted in the idea that we know what needs to be done to address the border and that certain politicians just lack the willpower to use the tools available to them. It's also rooted in the view that a small group of people have become the primary decision makers on the border. (Harris, for her part, has bought into this.)That's correct, but it shouldn't be the case. As Congress fails to update the nation's border management tools, it's largely been up to the executive branch to handle things. It's filling a vacuum that shouldn't be there. Predictably, this has deepened the perception among presidents and voters that the border can and should be ruled by fiat, and it has given members of Congress cover for failing to do their jobs.The situation is getting even more complicated: Last year, for the first time ever, more than half of people crossing the border illegally came from countries other than Mexico and the Northern Triangle. Until lawmakers adjust to this reality, the border will be a chaotic place -- and politicians will be able to misrepresent and weaponize it.The post How Did Immigration Politics Get So Toxic? appeared first on Reason.com.",

    "title": "What you need to know about the 2024 US presidential election",
    "content": "The 2024 US presidential election is unlike any other before it.The Republican candidate, former President Donald Trump, was convicted of a crime and faced two assassination attempts. The Democratic candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris, rose to the top of the ticket after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July.With just over three weeks until the November 5 election, opinion polls show a tight race, including in the seven battleground states that will decide the contest.Harris' candidacy re-energised the Democratic Party, sparking a surge in fundraising and enthusiasm from groups such as young voters, women and voters of colour that Biden lacked. If elected, Harris, the daughter of a Jamaican father and a South Asian mother, would be the first woman and second person of colour to serve as US president.Harris, 59, is widely seen to have bested Trump, 78, in their combative September 10 debate, putting him on the defensive with a stream of attacks about his fitness for office and myriad legal woes. But some likely voters say they still want to hear more about her policies and what her presidency would look like.Trump, who served as president from 2017-2021, continues to have an advantage on the economy, a top voter concern. He also has maintained support among voters who prioritize a secure US border with Mexico.Trump survived an attempt on his life during a July 13 rally in Pennsylvania, when a gunman's bullet grazed his ear. He was targeted a second time by an alleged assassin in September while playing golf on his private Florida course. The gunman was apprehended before any shots were fired.In May, Trump became the first former president to be convicted of a crime when he was found guilty on 34 felony counts relating to a scheme to cover up an alleged affair with a porn star. He is due to be sentenced after the election.Both candidates tapped relative political unknowns as their vice presidential running mates, with Harris selecting Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a former member of Congress, and Trump choosing first-term US Senator JD Vance of Ohio.Robert F. Kennedy Jr., 70, a scion of the prominent political family, had been running as an independent candidate, but he left the race in August and endorsed Trump.Biden, 81, decided not to run for re-election after a faltering debate performance against Trump in June sparked concerns about his mental acuity and resulted in calls from party leaders and donors to exit the race.Trump has refused to say he would abide by this year's election results, and he continues to falsely claim that Biden's victory over him in the 2020 election was fraudulent. His allies are laying the groundwork for a significant poll-watching effort and potential post-election legal challenges.Since becoming the Democratic candidate, Harris has tried to draw sharp contrasts with Trump, positioning herself as a next-generation leader with an eye toward the future while casting him as an agent of \"chaos.\"Harris has been able to draw a contrast as well with Biden, whom voters also viewed as someone who may have grown too old for the job.On policy, however, she has largely stuck with Biden on issues such as the economy, the Gaza conflict, immigration and abortion rights.Harris has put forth proposals that would cut taxes for a large swath of voters and pledged new investments in child care and healthcare. Polls show she has gained some ground on Trump on the economy.However, inflation continues to be a sticking point after peaking in 2022. While the inflation rate has since eased, voters remain concerned about high prices for food and housing.Harris has pointed to federal investments in infrastructure, clean energy and chip manufacturing that she says will generate long-term job growth.Trump and his campaign contend Americans were better off economically during his time in the White House, pointing to inflation and high interest rates under Biden and Harris' watch.Trump has made tariffs and tax cuts the key elements of his economic pitch to voters. He has said he would cut federal spending, which Republicans blame for stoking inflation and triggering consumer price spikes, and trim back federal regulations.Trump also has said he would revive stricter immigration policies from his time in office to stem the record flow of migrants into the US from Mexico, and would conduct mass deportations.Trump has claimed, without providing evidence, that the influx of migrants has led to a rise in violent crime. Studies show immigrants are less likely to engage in criminality than native-born Americans.As a rebuttal to charges that he is a danger to democracy, Trump has accused the Biden White House of weaponising the Justice Department in order to prosecute him and prevent him from winning another term. The Justice Department says it acts without political bias.On foreign policy, Trump embraces what he calls an \"America First\" agenda that seeks to avoid international entanglements. He has pledged to keep the country out of \"forever wars\" and claims he could end the Ukraine-Russia conflict within 24 hours.Read: Melania defends abortion as Donald Trump says states should decide, Guardian reportsWHERE DO HARRIS AND TRUMP STAND ON ABORTION?Democrats have made abortion rights central to their 2024 campaign, two years after the Supreme Court - powered by a conservative majority that Trump installed - overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision and ruled that abortion was not constitutionally protected.Opinion polls show most Americans do not favour strict limits on reproductive rights, and Democrats are hoping threats to those rights will encourage millions of women and independents to vote their way this year.Harris has argued for federal legislation that would restore the constitutional right to abortion.Trump has said the matter should be left to individual states and that he does not support a national ban on the procedure. He supports exceptions for rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother.At the June debate with Biden, Trump said he would \"not block\" access to abortion medication as president despite moves by some Republican-led states to restrict the use of the drugs.Since 2021, the Biden administration has grappled with record numbers of migrants caught illegally crossing the US-Mexico border.Harris was sent by Biden to serve as a liaison between the US and Central American nations that served as origin points for migration to the border. Republicans have attempted to cast her as a \"border czar,\" but she was never tasked with overseeing border-security efforts.In June, as polls showed immigration to be a top issue for the election, Biden implemented a new series of restrictive security measures that permit the government to quickly deport or turn back migrants who enter the country illegally without allowing them to claim asylum.The measures bore resemblance to Trump-era border policies, prompting criticism from liberals. But they have resulted in dramatically fewer border crossings.In February, Trump urged congressional Republicans to back away from a bipartisan bill that gave his party many of the border-related measures it sought in order to avoid giving Biden a policy victory.Biden - and now Harris - have been heavily criticized by many Democrats for the administration's steadfast support of Israel in its yearlong conflict with Hamas in Gaza.The Biden administration has called for the Israeli government to temper its assault on Gaza, where more than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to health officials in the enclave. However, at the same time the Biden administration continues to supply Israel with military munitions.Harris backs efforts to reach a ceasefire deal that would end the hostilities in exchange for a return of hostages taken on October 7, 2023, when Hamas militants invaded southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, according to Israeli figures. But those efforts have been complicated by the expansion of the conflict into Lebanon.Trump and Republicans also back Israel and have accused pro-Palestinian protesters of being anti-Semitic. But Trump has urged Israel to \"finish up\" the war or risk losing global support.The Biden administration has said it wants to \"de-risk\" and not \"de-couple\" its relationship with China and work to keep the competition between the world's No. 1 and No. 2 economic powers from escalating into conflict. Even so, the White House in September imposed more tariffs on Chinese goods such as steel and aluminium products and EV batteries.Biden has sworn to protect Taiwan from any Chinese attack.Trump favours a policy of strategic ambiguity to deliberately create uncertainty about how the U.S. would act if there was a Chinese invasion of the democratically governed island.While some Republicans view China as a rising national security threat, Trump largely has characterized the Asian giant as an economic rival and has vowed to impose further tariffs on Chinese imports.Biden and Harris have been a fierce advocate of providing weapons and other assistance to Ukraine in its war with Russia, while Trump has repeatedly expressed doubts about whether such aid is in the U.S. national interest.Trump in April declined to lobby against passage of a $95 billion bipartisan aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan spearheaded by Republican House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, even as it was opposed by Trump's allies in Congress.But at the September debate with Harris, Trump declined to say whether Ukraine should win the war and has since suggested it should have capitulated to Russia to prevent the invasion.In February, Trump made waves when he suggested the US should not defend NATO countries that do not meet their obligations to contribute to their national defence.Because many states vote dependably for Democrats or Republicans in presidential elections, the outcome usually rests on a handful of states where the election is truly competitive.Polls show Trump and Harris are neck and neck in the seven swing states: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina.With 19 electoral votes, Pennsylvania is the biggest prize among the battleground states that will decide the election.",

I'm very happy because I know and believe that she will be the next president of these United States.\"Not to make you guys feel bad, but it takes a woman,\" he adds. \"But not just any woman, a wonderful woman.

    "title": "Election 2024: Here are the issues Arizona voters care the most about",
    "content": "Arizona will be one of the most fiercely contested states when it comes to the 2024 presidential election, four years after President Joe Biden won the Grand Canyon State's 11 electoral votes by just 0.3 percentage points. The state saw a multitude of election challenges from former President Donald Trump.The Washington Examiner is following five key issues voters care about as they prepare to vote for the next president of the United States. The specific issues being tracked are social security, crime, abortion, economy, and immigration.The issues were chosen with the help of the Associated Press issues tracker. The Washington Examiner subsequently compared five of the key issues in Google Trends on a state-by-state basis, revealing which issues are most important to voters in swing contests.Here, you can track the importance of these various concerns to Arizona voters over a rolling 30-day period.CrimeConcerns over crime have remained a huge concern for Arizona voters, ranking as the most searched issue in the state.After the COVID-19 lockdown, crime rose in 2021 and 2022 but fell back down in 2023. Crime is 13% lower than it was in 2022. Nonaggravated assault, larceny, and crimes involving drugs and narcotics, as well as drug equipment, were the most common forms of crime seen throughout the state. Arrests are also up 6.29%.2024 ELECTIONS LIVE UPDATES: LATEST NEWS ON THE TRUMP-HARRIS PRESIDENTIAL RACEAn Arizona State University study shows that despite the influx of immigrants, there was no significant difference in the relationship between violent crimes or gang activity between illegal immigrants and U.S. citizens. Approximately 9% of all arrestees in Maricopa County (population 4.6 million) were illegal immigrants.Since statistics don't show large numbers of crimes in regard to immigrants despite Arizona being the only border swing state, it leaves immigration to be an issue more intertwined with Social Security than anything else.Social SecurityIn Arizona, Social Security is a huge concern, charting at No. 2 for voters.There are almost 1.3 million Arizonans age 65 and up, 18% of the state's population. The concern that Social Security reserves will no longer be fully funded by 2035 if the government does not take action to prevent it, according to the Social Security Administration, is a very pressing matter.At a Social Security roundtable in July, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) pitched multiple ideas for maintaining Social Security, such as cutting spending on foreign wars and eliminating Social Security for illegal immigrants. However, statistics show that immigrants contribute largely to Social Security funds.Gosar's Social Security conversation turned into worries that the influx of immigrants would put further strain on Social Security, worrying voters about the reliability of the government-funded retirement program. However, there is noncitizen eligibility for Social Security that immigrants can partake in if they are in a qualified category and meet the requirements.Featured Local SavingsAbortionAbortion was the third most searched issue in the state, yet abortion, in particular, turned Arizona into a political battleground this year. It skyrocketed and became the most searched topic on Sept. 11 following the presidential debate the night before.After the reversal of Roe v. Wade in 2022, the state passed a law that prevented abortions past 15 weeks and required a parent or guardian to provide written consent to the procedure for minors. A minor can pursue judicial bypass of consent, but there is still a mandatory wait time of 24 hours after the patient attends the required ultrasound and counseling appointment. The state has exceptions for the life of the mother but not for rape or incest.In April 2024, the Arizona Supreme Court revived an abortion ban the nation hadn't seen since 1864, but Gov. Katie Hobbs (D-AZ) signed legislation to repeal it in May, leaving the 15-week abortion law in place.In August, it was announced that a constitutional amendment, the Arizona Abortion Access Act, will be placed on the ballot this November to protect and expand abortion rights up to fetal viability, approximately 24 weeks of gestation.EconomyWorries over the state of the economy ranked second to last. The unemployment rate in Arizona as of November 2023 was 4.3%, placing the state 10th in the nation. The economy is growing, with a 4.9% increase in gross domestic product, equalling $510.6 billion in goods and services, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Bureau of Economic Analysis.The industries that have seen the most growth over the last year are the retail industry and construction, both amounting to a 21% increase. Real estate grew 5.1% and manufacturing increased 4.3%, but wholesale trade and education fell roughly 3.5% each.There are more successful women-owned businesses in Arizona than anywhere else in the country, and Arizonans have also seen a stark decrease in inflation rates, with August 2024 rates dropping to 2.3% in contrast to August 2022 rates seeing 13% inflation.ImmigrationDespite Tucson seeing the highest levels of immigration for the southern border this year, the issue doesn't seem too pressing to Arizona citizens compared to other topics.Nearly half of all Arizona immigrants are naturalized. The total population is 964,200 immigrants. In 2022, immigrants accounted for 16.2% of the labor force and 20.4% of entrepreneurs. Immigrant businesses saw a total business income of $2.2 billion, had a spending power of $28.4 billion, and paid $9.1 billion in taxes.\nThe top countries of origin for Arizona immigrants are Mexico, India, Canada, the Philippines, and Vietnam.In June, lawmakers approved a November ballot measure, the Secure the Border Act, that would make crossing the border without prior authorization, including the process of seeking asylum, a state crime. The law wouldn't have any impact on those fleeing persecution.",

    "content": "(Web Desk): Renowned Indian musician AR Rahman has recorded a 30-minute performance video in support of Kamala Harris, a candidate for the upcoming US presidential elections.The initiative aims to enhance Harris's popularity ahead of the elections scheduled for November 5.By recording this video, AR Rahman has become the first international artist from South Asia to endorse a US presidential candidate, according to Express news.Shekhar Narasimhan, chairperson of the Asian American Pacific Islanders (AAPI) Victory Fund, stated, \"With this performance, AR Rahman has added his voice to a group of leaders and artists standing for progress and representation in America.\"The AAPI Victory Fund is a political committee focused on encouraging and mobilising eligible voters.Shekhar Narasimhan further emphasised that the performance is not merely a musical event but also a call to action for communities to participate and vote for the future they wish to see.A teaser video has also been released, featuring AR Rahman and MR Rangaswami, founder of Indiaspora, aimed at energising activist engagement.According to a press release, the show will include some of AR Rahman's most beloved songs and messages promoting support for Kamala Harris and commitment to the AAPI community.The video recording will be aired on the AAPI Victory Fund's YouTube channel on October 13 at 8 PM.Taylor Swift endorses Kamala Harris in the 2024 Presidential racePreviously, Singer Taylor Swift also endorsed Kamala Harris after her debate against Republican rival Donald Trump, calling the Democratic nominee a \"steady-handed, gifted leader\" who could lead the country with calm rather than chaos.In a post on Instagram, Swift told her over 280 million followers that she would vote for the US vice president in the November 5 election, marking the biggest celebrity endorsement yet for Harris. Polls indicated that the race was essentially tied between the two candidates.In her post, Swift stated, \"I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I'm voting for Kamala Harris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.\"Swift was pictured with her cat in the post, which she signed as \"childless cat lady,\" in a dig at Trump's running mate JD Vance, who in a 2021 interview called some Democrats \"a bunch of childless cat ladies.\"Vance had since clarified that it was merely a \"sarcastic remark.\"Swift also expressed admiration for Harris' running mate Tim Walz, describing him as someone \"who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman's right to her own body for decades.\"Reproductive rights had become a key issue for voters since the US Supreme Court ended the constitutional right to abortion two years earlier.IVF fertility treatments were also thrust into the spotlight after an Alabama court ruled earlier that year that frozen embryos were considered people.Harris, who supported abortion rights, cast Trump as a threat to reproductive rights in the country following his appointment of Supreme Court justices who helped overturn the Roe v. Wade ruling in 2022.",

    "title": "Election 2024: Here are the issues Arizona voters care the most about - Conservative Angle",
    "content": "Arizona will be one of the most fiercely contested states when it comes to the 2024 presidential election, four years after President Joe Biden won the Grand Canyon State's 11 electoral votes by just 0.3 percentage points. The state saw a multitude of election challenges from former President Donald Trump.The Washington Examiner is following five key issues voters care about as they prepare to vote for the next president of the United States. The specific issues being tracked are social security, crime, abortion, economy, and immigration.The issues were chosen with the help of the Associated Press issues tracker. The Washington Examiner subsequently compared five of the key issues in Google Trends on a state-by-state basis, revealing which issues are most important to voters in swing contests.Here, you can track the importance of these various concerns to Arizona voters over a rolling 30-day period.Concerns over crime have remained a huge concern for Arizona voters, ranking as the most searched issue in the state.After the COVID-19 lockdown, crime rose in 2021 and 2022 but fell back down in 2023. Crime is 13% lower than it was in 2022. Nonaggravated assault, larceny, and crimes involving drugs and narcotics, as well as drug equipment, were the most common forms of crime seen throughout the state. Arrests are also up 6.29%.2024 ELECTIONS LIVE UPDATES: LATEST NEWS ON THE TRUMP-HARRIS PRESIDENTIAL RACEAn Arizona State University study shows that despite the influx of immigrants, there was no significant difference in the relationship between violent crimes or gang activity between illegal immigrants and U.S. citizens. Approximately 9% of all arrestees in Maricopa County (population 4.6 million) were illegal immigrants.Since statistics don't show large numbers of crimes in regard to immigrants despite Arizona being the only border swing state, it leaves immigration to be an issue more intertwined with Social Security than anything else.In Arizona, Social Security is a huge concern, charting at No. 2 for voters.There are almost 1.3 million Arizonans age 65 and up, 18% of the state's population. The concern that Social Security reserves will no longer be fully funded by 2035 if the government does not take action to prevent it, according to the Social Security Administration, is a very pressing matter.At a Social Security roundtable in July, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) pitched multiple ideas for maintaining Social Security, such as cutting spending on foreign wars and eliminating Social Security for illegal immigrants. However, statistics show that immigrants contribute largely to Social Security funds.Gosar's Social Security conversation turned into worries that the influx of immigrants would put further strain on Social Security, worrying voters about the reliability of the government-funded retirement program. However, there is noncitizen eligibility for Social Security that immigrants can partake in if they are in a qualified category and meet the requirements.Abortion was the third most searched issue in the state, yet abortion, in particular, turned Arizona into a political battleground this year. It skyrocketed and became the most searched topic on Sept. 11 following the presidential debate the night before.After the reversal of Roe v. Wade in 2022, the state passed a law that prevented abortions past 15 weeks and required a parent or guardian to provide written consent to the procedure for minors. A minor can pursue judicial bypass of consent, but there is still a mandatory wait time of 24 hours after the patient attends the required ultrasound and counseling appointment. The state has exceptions for the life of the mother but not for rape or incest.In April 2024, the Arizona Supreme Court revived an abortion ban the nation hadn't seen since 1864, but Gov. Katie Hobbs (D-AZ) signed legislation to repeal it in May, leaving the 15-week abortion law in place.In August, it was announced that a constitutional amendment, the Arizona Abortion Access Act, will be placed on the ballot this November to protect and expand abortion rights up to fetal viability, approximately 24 weeks of gestation.Worries over the state of the economy ranked second to last. The unemployment rate in Arizona as of November 2023 was 4.3%, placing the state 10th in the nation. The economy is growing, with a 4.9% increase in gross domestic product, equalling $510.6 billion in goods and services, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Bureau of Economic Analysis.The industries that have seen the most growth over the last year are the retail industry and construction, both amounting to a 21% increase. Real estate grew 5.1% and manufacturing increased 4.3%, but wholesale trade and education fell roughly 3.5% each.There are more successful women-owned businesses in Arizona than anywhere else in the country, and Arizonans have also seen a stark decrease in inflation rates, with August 2024 rates dropping to 2.3% in contrast to August 2022 rates seeing 13% inflation.Despite Tucson seeing the highest levels of immigration for the southern border this year, the issue doesn't seem too pressing to Arizona citizens compared to other topics.Nearly half of all Arizona immigrants are naturalized. The total population is 964,200 immigrants. In 2022, immigrants accounted for 16.2% of the labor force and 20.4% of entrepreneurs. Immigrant businesses saw a total business income of $2.2 billion, had a spending power of $28.4 billion, and paid $9.1 billion in taxes.\nThe top countries of origin for Arizona immigrants are Mexico, India, Canada, the Philippines, and Vietnam.In June, lawmakers approved a November ballot measure, the Secure the Border Act, that would make crossing the border without prior authorization, including the process of seeking asylum, a state crime. The law wouldn't have any impact on those fleeing persecution.",

    "title": "What Are 'Inauthentic Influencers,' and What's Their Role in an Election Where Democracy Is on the Ballot?",
    "content": "At the end of the poll, the user is prompted to enter credit card information on a page similar to other reported scams that promise free American flags and then make unsolicited charges to users' cards.As candidates ramp up messaging ahead of the election, both Democrats and Republicans are leaning into the influencer economy, pushing their messages about how each will lead the country if elected in November. But, another kind of influencer has been running ads on popular social networks and may have changed the way you think about political subjects without you even realizing it.s to push misleading claims and, often, scams.Collabstr analyzed the latest reports from the Institute for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship's ElectionGraph project to illustrate how so-called inauthentic influencers have sought to manipulate the decisions of voters ahead of the 2024 presidential election.s run on Meta platforms, including Facebook and Instagram. It's worth noting that Neo4j performed its analysis before Biden stepped down as the Democratic Party candidate.s with no disclaimer.In many cases, researchers found these networks pushing factually inaccurate and misleading claims as well as outright scams. Sometimes they're linked by common credentials like phone numbers and addresses, connections that aren't obvious to the users who see their ads in their feeds.Inauthentic influencers potentially reach millions with manipulative contentUltimately, the IDJC identified 158 networks of these accounts collectively representing $8.5 million in ad spending and 504 million impressions from September 2023 through April 2024.An impression is a count of every time a post appears on a user's screen while scrolling on a social network -- whether or not they liked, shared, commented, or interacted with it at all. It provides the broadest possible picture of the impact a single post may have had on users.For comparison, the analytics service Databox estimates that the entire apparel and footwear industry achieved 460,000 impressions via Facebook ads in one month in 2023. If extrapolated over the period of the IDCJ study, that could amount to roughly 3.68 million impressions -- a fraction of the more than 500 million impressions made by inauthentic influencers.Researchers categorized pages according to independent reviews by team members, Google searches to determine political party affiliation, and the Ad Fontes media bias scale. The team found that conservative-leaning pages spent $2.1 million more on ads over the period studied and recorded 315.4 million more impressions than progressive-leaning pages. And accounts falling into these ideological categories targeted different groups of Meta users across Facebook and Instagram.Targeting older users in highly populous and swing statesThose partisan pages were equally likely to target older users over younger ones with their posts, but there were differences in the gender of users targeted. Researchers drew a parallel between how progressive pages aligned with national political trends in targeting more women with their ads than men and how conservative-leaning pages targeted men more heavily.The ads tended to push misleading information about different topics based on their ideological leanings, too. Among conservative influencer networks identified, immigration, the economy, safety, and foreign policy were the top issues. For progressive pages, the economy was an important issue, too, along with health and social issues, including abortion access, according to researchers.MAGA swag and health benefits scamsAside from Donald Trump-related swag and financial scams from conservative-leaning pages, researchers found that progressive-leaning pages also commonly pushed health benefits-related scams to users they targeted with ads.Facebook has since shut down the Patriot Sanctuary page and others identified in research from the IDJC, which makes its database of political ads on Meta available publicly. Researchers warn, however, that when one page is closed, another tends to pop up in its place.Data from Meta also paints an incomplete picture of the networks of dishonest actors that could be working to fleece concerned citizens and manipulate voters. The company is the only major ad platform or social network that allows approved organizations access to its advertising data for study. Social networks, including X, formerly known as Twitter, and TikTok, do not offer the same access.\"It underscores that tech platforms need to do more to allow academics and journalists access to platform data so that political actors can be held to account with the American public,\" lead researcher Jennifer Stromer-Galley said in a statement.",

    "title": "The Post-Biden Presidential Quest by West: A Heartbreaking Gift to the Far Right",
    "content": "A bit of ancient wisdom has it that the road to hell is paved by good intentions. So is the road to fascism, the closest modern variety of hell on earth. Yet fascists are not alone in their mad drive, both here and abroad, to destroy the last vestiges of liberal democracy and replace it with a totalitarian tyranny of unbridled militarism, racism and imperialism. Among those facilitating this nefarious outcome in the USA are three presidential candidates smugly professing to be anti-fascist and progressive, even socialist: Jill Stein, M.D, of the Green Party; Claudia de la Cruz, M.A., of the Party for Socialism and Liberation; and Cornel Ronald West, Ph.D, of the newly-hatched Justice for All Party. None has a snowball's chance in hell of garnering, either individually or collectively, anywhere near 5% of the vote in any state, let alone winning; but each can and will dilute the vote for the only viable anti-MAGA candidate, Kamala Harris, perhaps even sufficiently to catapult Trump back to the White House for a second regime, this time an openly fascist one. Because of its resonance in the African-American community, the quixotic presidential quest by Cornel West presents the greatest danger and threat.As was the case in the 2020 presidential election, African-American voters play a critical role in this one. Before thankfully withdrawing, Biden only had 64% of Black voters behind him, and was consequently headed for a decisive defeat. Harris, by sharp contrast, enjoys the support of over 80% of Black voters, a dramatic jump in popularity which makes having the first woman and first bilineal person of color as POTUS a distinct possibility. If not for West's candidacy, that historic outcome would be a probability, if not certainty. No wonder Trump stated in early September that West is \"one of my favorite candidates\"He takes 100% .\"Despite its lofty claims of promoting truth, love, justice and other pro-socialist ideals, the quest by West is locked in the dialectically opposite direction. Promoted in reality, but not rhetoric, is the antithesis of socialism, a return of MAGA fascism with a vengeance to the White House. In this post-Biden election, every vote for West is, in effect, a vote for Trump, a classic illustration of good intentions paving the way to hell. It is inconceivable that this truth is not known, though evidently not appreciated, by Dr. West. What is certainly known, and even welcomed, is the tremendous support, financial and otherwise, his campaign has received from Republican operatives and MAGA cult members.Financing the West QuestWithin a month after announcing his bid for the presidency, this time as an Independent, West received a hefty campaign donation of $3,300 from Harlan Crow, the notorious right-wing billionaire fan and funder of archconservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. After initially defending \"brother Harlan\" and welcoming his donation, West returned it in late October. Not returned was another $3,300 donation in late July 2023 from a certain Jeffrey Moe, a small business owner, who also made considerable donations to several MAGA candidates (e.g. $2,200 to Stewart Jones, congressional candidate for SC-District 3, co-sponsor of state legislation which would make women who had an abortion eligible for the death penalty; and $6,600 to Thomas Massie, identified as Kentucky's most conservative Congressman) as well as several Republican PACs (e.g. American Liberty Coalition, Americans United for Freedom, Forever Free PAC, ad nauseam). Moe gave the West campaign another $3,300 after Harris became the Democratic nominee. Steve Nielson, an employee of Martinez Oil Refining, regularly donated $1000 to West's presidential quest on the 29th of nearly every month in 2024. Martinez Oil is the defendant in several lawsuits charging it with illegal toxic releases. Ervin Seamster, senior pastor and visionary of the Light of the World Church of Christ, a large rigidly fundamentalist evangelical church in Dallas, is also among West's donors of $3,300, the individual maximum amount legally permissible.GOP petition canvassers for WestDespite these and other campaign donations from individuals associated with right-wing causes, the bulk of West's support from the Far Right came in the form of in-kind contributions to seek and secure ballot status, particularly in battleground states. A small army of Republican lawyers and MAGA operatives, not West's \"love warriors\", provided the requisite signature-gathering personnel and legal expertise to secure ballot status for the West candidacy in several states. \"If we can get him  on the ballot, he could take a percentage point away \", the rabid Islamophobe and former organizer for the Virginia Republican Party, Scott Presler, was quoted as saying while gathering signatures for West outside a Trump rally in North Carolina. MAGA Republicans put that anti-democratic intent into action nationwide.In Wisconsin, it was the Blair Group Consulting which paid Republican operatives to gather signatures for West. The head of BGC, David Blair, was the 2016 national director of Youth for Trump. At least two of his circulators of West nominating petitions, Abigail Draiss and Reyna Tomasak, graduated from Liberty University's Campus Leadership Program, an incubator for Far Right zealots. Another BGC canvasser for West, Simon Molina Herrara, worked for the Ron DeSantis presidential campaign, as well as promoted events in North Carolina for US Representative Madison Cawthorn, arguably the most reactionary member of the 117th Congress. The Vice-President of Field Operations at BGC, Arik Amudsen, an Oklahoma delegate to the 2024 RNC, coordinated signature gathering for West in Arizona; he was joined by Dausin Olberding, 2020 field director of Iowa Trump Victory. In Arizona and North Carolina, Wells Marketing, another Republican firm, registered more than 170 and 200 individuals, respectively, to serve as paid circulators for West. Accordingly, it is estimated that only 3,000 of the 30,000 signatures submitted to North Carolina election officials came from West's \"love warriors\".Also active in petition gathering for West in North Carolina and Arizona as well as Alabama was People Over Profit, a nonprofit registered in Virginia this year by Republican operatives Cabell Hobbs and Timothy Beall. As CFO of Rightside Compliance, Beall facilitated the receipt of $1.8 million from various Republican sources, such as Ron DeSantis' SuperPac, Never Back Down. Hobbs served as treasurer for several Republican campaigns, most recently Ted Cruz for Senate. In August, he admitted to the FEC that the Cruz campaign had taken in 43 illegal donations. Also giving the West quest a big boost in North Carolina this summer was the Republican outfit Blitz Canvassing, which secured some 13,000 signatures for West. Blitz is also heavily funded by Never Back Down. Its President, Andrew Bell, managed the unsuccessful race of Republican Dino Rossi for Washington's 8th Congressional District, but did succeed in helping get Kim Wyman re-elected as once the only state Republican officeholder on the West Coast. In Maine, National Ballot Access helped get West on the ballot despite its Secretary of State acknowledging that \"some signatures on West's petition were indeed collected fraudulently\". Petition circulators for West in suburban Washington enticed voters by claiming the petition were to help get Trump on the ballot. No stranger to repeated use of deceptive tactics, Mark Jacoby's firm, Let Voters Decide, pushed to get another West, rapper Kanye West, on the ballot to dilute Biden's 2020 vote. Jacoby, who is closely affiliated with Wells Marketing, was once convicted of voter fraud.GOP lawyers for WestGathering sufficient valid nominating signatures was the first hurdle cleared for West by Republican operatives. Winning legal challenges to submitted petitions was the second. A small legion of lawyers, all Republicans and members of the National Republican Lawyers Association (with one possible exception), took on that task with mixed results. Foremost among West's attorney armada was Matthew Haverstick, managing partner of the Philadelphia-based Kleinbard law firm, which provided at least $22,000 of legal services for the RNC in mid-2022 and $11,000 to promote MAGA Congressman Scott Perry. Haverstick individually donated $8,000 to the Senate Republican Campaign Committee and $2,500 to the right-wing Keystone Alliance PAC in January 2004. Haverstick re-entered West's legal defense in early October, arguing in federal court that his client had been illegally denied ballot access in Pennsylvania; this very belated effort failed on October 10. The certified ballot list in this absolutely crucial battleground state was officially finalized on September 16.Representing West in Arizona was attorney Paul Hamrick, a graduate of Faulkner University, a fundamentalist Christian University in Alabama which is \"committed to the centrality of Jesus and His cross\" and only permits men in church leadership. Also representing West in Arizona was Brett W. Johnson and Amanda A. Reeve of the law firm Snell & Wilmer. Reeve is a former Republican state legislator and was the deputy chair of the Bush/Cheney campaign in 2003-04. Snell & Wilmer received considerable compensation for its legal services from the RNC ($40,000 and $90,000 in 2024 and 2022, respectively) and the NRSC ($39,000 and $180,000 in 2024 and 2022, respectively). Representing West in Michigan was John Bursch, former state solicitor general under GOP attorney general Bill Schuete. He is also the Vice-President for Appellate Advocacy for Alliance Defending Freedom, a far right organization founded by fundamentalist Christian leaders such as James Dobson and R. James Kennedy. ADF argued against same-sex marriage before the US Supreme Court. In Georgia, West's legal wranglings to get on the ballot were managed by Bryan Tyson, head of Elections Law Group which received at least $10,000 from the RNC in 2014. Another Republican lawyer used by West, this time in North Carolina, was Phil Strach, who successfully challenged the North Carolina Board of Elections decision to disallow West on the state ballot. The ruling was made by U.S. District Judge Terrance Boyle, who once was a legislative assistant to racist U.S. Senator Jesse Helms. Supporting West in the North Carolina case were amicus curiae briefs filed by the RNC and the state's Republican Party. Similarly, Michigan's Judge James Redford overruled a decision by the state's Bureau of Elections to bar West from ballot status. Redford is the former chief legal counsel for the administration of Republican Governor Rick Snyder. In his unsuccessful 2014 bid as a Republican for the state Supreme Court, Redford was heavily supported financially by the notorious DeVos family.The Battleground StatesAs of mid-October, polls indicate that Harris has 49.4% and Trump has 46.4% of the projected presidential vote nationally. However, the race is closer within the seven battleground states. Fortunately, the West/Abdullah ticket is not on the ballot in Georgia, Arizona and Pennsylvania, so that campaign will not directly dilute the Harris/Walz vote there. As the battle for Pennsylvania emerged as the Gettysburg of the 2024 presidential election, West adamantly refused to be barred from the fight. Determined to be the key spoiler in the Keystone State, he appealed his ban from the battle in two state courts, including the PA Supreme Court, to federal court, and thankfully lost again. The absence of West on the PA ballot is especially important since the Harris-Trump gap is only 2%; 3% of the PA voters remain undecided; West was polling at 2%; and Harris had only 70% (compared to Trump's 11%) of the projected Black vote, leaving a considerable percentage of Black voters in PA up for grabs.",

    "title": "Trump ahead of Harris in handling Ukraine and Middle East conflicts, say voters in seven critical battleground states: WSJ Poll shows",
    "content": "Former President Donald Trump holds a significant edge over Vice President Kamala Harris in handling major international conflicts, according to a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) poll of voters in seven critical battleground states that could determine the 2024 presidential election.The poll, released Friday, shows Trump ahead in foreign policy, particularly in the management of two key global conflicts. A total of 50 per cent of voters in these states believe Trump is better equipped to handle the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, while 39 per cent back Harris on the issue. In the Israel-Hamas conflict, Trump maintains a similar advantage, with 48 per cent of respondents favoring his approach compared to 33 per cent for Harris.The WSJ poll, conducted between September 28 and October 8, surveyed 600 registered voters in each of the seven states, with a margin of error of 4 percentage points per state.The close results reflect other recent national polls, indicating a highly competitive race ahead of the November 5, 2024 election. Earlier this week, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Harris with a slight lead over Trump nationally, garnering 46 per cent support compared to Trump's 43 per cent.While Trump's strength lies in his perceived ability to manage international conflicts, particularly in foreign policy and security matters, he is also favoured on key domestic issues such as the economy and immigration. Harris, on the other hand, is seen as stronger on social issues, with more voters supporting her positions on housing, healthcare, and social welfare.As both candidates focus on the swing states, the fight for these key regions is expected to be crucial in determining the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. The battle for voters in these pivotal states could ultimately decide the next occupant of the White House.",

    "title": "How voting before Election Day became so widespread and so political",
    "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Voters had plenty to argue about in the 1972 election, but they overwhelmingly agreed that when it came time to vote, they would do so in person on Election Day.The act of voting was largely a communal experience that year, when roughly 95% of voters went to their local polling places and completed and submitted their ballots in person on a single day, according to a census survey at the time.That number would fall gradually over the next 50 years as states provided Americans with more options on how and when to vote.By 2022, only about half of the electorate voted at the polls on Election Day. The share of people voting before Election Day spiked to more than 70% in 2020, and votes cast by mail surpassed those cast on Election Day for the first time ever. That year, many states enacted emergency measures to temporarily expand vote-by-mail options to protect voters from the spread of COVID-19.\"We've been on an upward trend of early voting over time as more states have adopted early voting options and voters have embraced them,\" said University of Florida political science professor Michael McDonald, who tracks voter turnout and early voting. \"That's resulted in a greater share of early votes being cast each election cycle.\"For most of that time, advance voting was a nonpartisan feature of elections, but a deep chasm formed between the parties on advance voting during and since the 2020 presidential election.Voting before Election Day is much more common today than it was roughly 50 years ago. Yet it is highly politicized as voting in the 2024 presidential election is already underway.Advance voting refers to the range of options that people have to vote before Election Day, whether by mail or in person at an election facility.The term \"early voting\" can refer collectively to all voting that takes place before Election Day. Sometimes it refers explicitly to votes cast in person at local election offices or voting centers before Election Day.To avoid confusion, The Associated Press generally uses terms like \"advance voting\" or \"pre-Election Day voting\" to refer to that broader category and \"early in-person voting\" for the narrower one. \"Absentee voting\" usually refers to ballots cast by mail.Voting before Election Day includes both voting by mail and in-person voting conducted before Election Day.Early in-person voting tends to mimic the experience of voting in person on Election Day, down to the type of voting equipment used and the locations serving as voting centers. The main difference is that the voting is conducted before Election Day. The length of early in-person voting periods varies by state.Mail voting can be further divided into at least two smaller categories: \"no-excuse absentee voting,\" where any voter may request a mail ballot for any reason, and \"excuse-required absentee voting,\" where only voters with a valid excuse as to why they cannot vote in person on Election Day may vote by mail.Requiring an excuse to vote absentee, such as travel or illness, used to be the norm in most states. Today, a shrinking handful of states still require voters to provide an authorized excuse.A third category of mail voting is a hybrid of mail voting and early in-person voting: in-person absentee voting, where a voter submits (and sometimes fills out) a mail ballot in person at an elections office.A small but growing number of states conduct their elections predominantly by mail. Those states, plus a few others and the District of Columbia, automatically send every registered voter a ballot.Variations of absentee voting and voting over multiple days have been part of American elections since the nation's founding. Today's system of mail voting and early in-person voting took root more than a century ago. In 1921, Louisiana paved the way for a formalized early in-person voting system when its constitution specified that \"the Legislature may provide a method by which absentee voting will be permitted other than by mail.\"Voting by mail is even older, but relatively few voters were allowed to take advantage of it as of 1972. Just two years later, Washington became the first state in the nation to allow any voter to request a mail ballot for any reason.By 2005, more than half the states adopted no-excuse absentee voting. Today, only Alabama, Mississippi and New Hampshire provide neither early in-person voting nor no-excuse absentee voting.Yes, but it wasn't always that way.Voting before Election Day steadily grew more popular in both Democratic and Republican-controlled states after 1972. Although there was a partisan split in some states that sometimes varied from election to election, polling from Gallup shows that nationwide there was little partisan divide on advance voting between 2004 and 2016. But the survey showed that voters' plans to use early voting sharply diverged along party lines in the 2020 presidential election.AP's VoteCast survey of the 2020 electorate found a similar result, with additional details on how the choice of voting method divided the electorate. About two-thirds of the votes cast by mail in that election were for Democrat Joe Biden, compared with about one-third for Republican President Donald Trump. In contrast, Trump won about two-thirds of the in-person Election Day vote, compared with about one-third for Biden.When it came to early in-person voting, there was a near-even split, with Trump having only the slightest advantage.Biden overperformed among those casting votes before Election Day, especially among mail-in voters, even in many states that Trump won by a wide margin, VoteCast showed.\"This is just an across-the-board, national phenomenon,\" McDonald said.These patterns continued in the 2022 midterm elections, with Democrats accounting for the bulk of the mail vote, Republicans casting most of the Election Day vote and Republicans holding a small advantage in early in-person voting.McDonald noted that party behavior on pre-Election Day voting was, if anything, the opposite before 2020.\"People who voted by mail tended to be more Republican than the people who voted in-person early,\" he said, but those patterns \"were suddenly turned upside down\" during the pandemic.During the 2020 election, Trump repeatedly disparaged, politicized and undermined mail voting, going as far as to block funding to the U.S. Postal Service to thwart its ability to process mail ballots he claimed without evidence were susceptible to widespread tampering.Trump's messaging on mail balloting has been somewhat inconsistent. At times he has said \"absentee voting\" is \" good. \" But he also has claimed that mail voting is ripe for fraud, something not borne out by decades of mail voting conducted in every state. Trump himself has cast mail ballots on multiple occasions, including in the 2020 primaries.Trump's rhetoric seems to have taken a toll on Republican confidence in mail voting. An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in 2023 found that 58% of Republicans were not very or not at all confident that mail votes would be counted accurately, compared with 32% in 2018. Among Democrats, confidence in the counting of mail ballots increased, from 28% saying they were very or extremely confident in 2018 to 52% in 2023.\"We need to wait and see how 2024 plays out before we make definitive statements about what the early voting is telling us\" about the election, McDonald said.Absentee voting in some states began as early as mid-September, and more than half the states had begun some type of voting by Oct. 1.Associated Press writer Maya Sweedler contributed to this report.",

This will result in 17 airings this season, including 14 simulcasts with ESPN and three games exclusively on ABC. The decision was a joint effort between the NFL and Walt Disney Company, which owns ABC and ESPN. Other added games include Baltimore at Tampa Bay, Tampa Bay at Kansas City, Houston at Dallas, Baltimore at Los Angeles Chargers, and New Orleans at Green Bay.Also Read: Travis Kelce is Reportedly Constructing a Custom-Built Man Cave Beneath His $6 Million Kansas City ResidenceNFL and Disney are expanding MNF simulcasts on ABCDisney is implementing a strategy that gained popularity during the Hollywood labor strikes to apply it to its regular business.The company plans to simulcast six ESPN's \"Monday Night Football\" broadcasts on ABC, aiming to increase viewership and ratings. The move will also move a Wednesday-night offering, \"Scamanda,\" to a different time slot. ABC will now air \"Monday Night Football\" on October 14, 21, November 4, 18, 25, and December 23, along with eight regular or post-season games. This move is expected to boost viewership and ratings.Disney and the NFL have agreed to ten additional simulcasts on ABC to protect the network from viewership shortfalls due to writer and actor strikes. This year, the NFL approved these scheduling changes, which are only in effect for the current TV season, despite no labor shortage causing concern.Disney faces challenges in retaining audiences as they shift from traditional broadcast and cable TV to streaming video. Sports programming remains a popular choice for advertisers and distributors, and the NFL encourages media partners to extend game broadcast reach. ABC has promoted a new series, \"Scamanda,\" based on a true-crime podcast, and will delay the last episodes of \"Wheel of Fortune\" featuring Pat Sajak, who recently stepped down from the role.The decision to add \"Monday Night Football\" to ABC was influenced by ratings and audience. Last season, the show had its most-watched run in 23 years, surpassing previous ESPN and ABC seasons. The addition of games allows ABC to run its traditional schedule without pre-emptions due to the 2024 presidential election and some \"MNF\" games already scheduled to appear on ABC.

    "content": "The Democratic Party has reportedly closed a campaign office in Tempe, Arizona, after it was targeted with gunfire overnight on three separate occasions over the past month.Speaking to USA Today, Lauren Kuby, a Democratic state Senate candidate, confirmed the office had been closed, with its activities transferred to alternative undisclosed locations. The newspaper reported the office had been struck by bullets and BB gun pellets three times overnight in as many weeks. The office was closed and empty at the time of all three incidents and there are no reports of any casualties.Concern about political violence in the United States soared after an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania on July 13 which left the Republican presidential nominee lightly injured in one ear, and killed one attendee. In a separate incident in September, a man, identified as Ryan Wesley Routh, was arrested after allegedly pointing a rifle through the fence of Trump's golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida. He has pled not guilty to a number of charges including attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate.The Arizona Democratic campaign office targeted in the shootings was located on Southern Avenue west of Priest Drive. The three shootings took place on September 16, September 23 and October 6. All three incidents are being investigated by the Tempe Police Department, which has advertised a $1,000 reward from Silent Witness for any information which leads to a suspect being arrested or indicted.In a statement referring to the most recent incident, a Tempe Police Department spokesperson said: \"On  around 12:30 a.m., the Democratic National Committee campaign office was struck by what appears to be gunfire. No one was inside the building. This is now the third incident at the campaign office.\"Silent Witness said the shootings involved \"BB Gun and firearm rounds,\" adding: \"All three incidents have occurred between 12 a.m. and 1 a.m. Investigators are seeking any assistance regarding these incidents.\"A flyer produced by Silent Witness, and circulated by Tempe police, includes a photograph of a potential suspect's car which is described as \"possibly a 2008-2013 silver Toyota Highlander with a sunroof, roof rack and 5 spoke rims.\" The organization also released a photograph from after the October 6 shooting which appeared to show a bullet hall in the Democratic Party office's window.Newsweek contacted the Democratic Party of Arizona for comment via email on Saturday outside of regular office hours.Speaking to Newsweek after the second shooting on September 23, Sean McEnerney, the Arizona Democratic National Committee coordinated campaign manager, said: \"Overnight, several shots were fired into our Tempe Democratic Party coordinated campaign office.\"We are grateful to Tempe Police for coming quickly to the scene and are fortunate no one was present or injured.\"Arizona is one of a number of key battleground states that are expected to determine who wins the 2024 presidential election. The state backed Trump in 2016 before switching its allegiance to Joe Biden in 2020.

I hope you and your loved ones are doing well.This year's elections are high stakes at the global, national, state and local levels. Though we all suffer from campaign media fatigue, we have to persevere and remember why we do the work we do and why it's important to participate in the decisions of who leads our city, our state and our country and what values we live through the laws we pass.Though they are a few in number, there are some people in politics genuinely trying to make the world a better place. We should support them. Laws that reach the ballot that make things better - we should support them. Laws that are mean and hateful toward the poor or working class - we should reject them.This voter guide relies on word of mouth and personal connections. Please share with your family, friends and networks. Be sure to vote and work to make the world a better place. I hope this guide is helpful for you.Peace, Empowerment and Wellness,Jeremiah Jeffries, A Public School Teacher for True Social Justice\"Not everyone who disagrees is an enemy and not everyone who agrees (or looks like you) is a friend.\" - Rafiq KalamId-Din Sr., 1975This is not an endorsement. I can not do that given that she has been one of the main voices of the Biden administration who supports the current oppression and genocide in Gaza and the Middle East and has opposed the self determination efforts of people of color around the world. Kamala stood by President Biden when the United States became the lone nation to veto and oppose Palestinian statehood at the UN, while propping up Israel's aggression toward Palestine and now Lebanon. Kamala has also stood by and supported Biden's foreign policy that actively utilizes the current Palestinian humanitarian crisis as a sound bite while simultaneously using Israel's right to national defense as an excuse to further provide weapons and funding to Israel as they commit genocide against the Palestanian people and bomb and kill innocent civilians in the region. And though Kamala is not president or in charge of U.S. foreign policy, she is an influencer and big voice in government and unfortunately has not had the courage to use her platform to advocate for stopping the genocide or violent agreession of Israel in any meaningful way. In fact she has only supported it.Foreign policy is only one major aspect of governance for the country. Here at home she has supported some good legislation around labor, student loan debt and Medicare. So me being the optimist and maybe even willfully naive, my hope is that as the first Black woman and potentially the most powerful person in the world, she will be different and her leadership will be distinct and separate from her predecessor. Unfortunately right now it's feeling like more of the same. If she wins she will have the opportunity to move the United State towards being a nation that promotes justice and does right by the people of this nation and the poor and oppressed around the world. We'll see.Nationally, there is the electoral college, but locally and for the state candidates and initiatives, it's a direct popular vote!!! Your vote counts and directly helps determine the outcome of elections.VOTE #3 NO Endorsement: All other candidates have not proven themselves capable or shown that they are anything other than self interested with little regard for the working people of San Francisco.The SF Board of Education is in charge of our local public schools. Due to chronic underfunding of public education, we are always navigating a financial crisis and being under threat of a state takeover, by the very same people who chose to underfund us in the first place.Public schools are always under attack politically, because it's considered one of the main factors in what allows people to have and exercise power in their lives. Education can lead to a strong desire for justice and equality. The attacks on schools and educators have been on-going and relentless nationally and locally. We need to elect knowledgeable and experienced people to lead our schools toward a system that serves and is responsive to the needs of our children and families. We need to elect only people who have a genuine connection to our public schools and are connected to the youth and families in our community and in our city.Matt Alexander, longtime educator - teacher, principal, co-founder of June Jordan School for Equity and organizer with Faith in Action, Matt has served well as a knowledgeable and compassionate leader on the Board of Education who is reflective and active in engaging communities and working to meet their needs.Virginia Cheung, director of Advancement for Wu Yee Children's Services. Virginia has been working in early childcare administration for over seven years, is a parent and will bring a new voice to the School Board.Aliya Chisti Rooted in San Francisco, Aliya is a former educator and policy analyst who oversees the Free City College program, a voice for students and knowledgeable about what CCSF needs.Alan Wong Born and raised in San Francisco, Alan is knowledgeable and cares about CCSF. His leadership has not been as inclusive as it needs to be, but he is supported and accountable to labor.District 1: Connie Chan Re-elect Connie Chan. She has lots of experience working on policy and has the values that represent San Francisco well. She has been working to serve San Francisco for many years as a public servant, her children go to public schools and she has shown her commitment to San Francisco and to making it a place for families.District 3: Ranked Choice: #1 Sharon Lai* #2 Moe Jamil*District 5: Ranked Choice: #1 #2 & #3 Dean Preston - Re-elect The only choice for District 5, Dean has represented his district and the city well and should be re-elected.District 7: Ranked Choice: #1 #2 & #3 Myrna Melgar - Re-elect Myrna Melgar's knowledge of housing, planning and community development has served her well on the board. Myrna is independent and cares about San Francisco. Her years of work in the community serving young people and their families and policy experience continue to inform her work on the Board and she has served her district and city well.District 9: Ranked Choice: #1 #2 & #3 Jackie Fielder - The only choice for District 9 Supervisor is Jackie Fielder! She is a strong woman of color with a heart of service. She supports a public bank and has concrete solutions and plans to address the wealth gap and housing gap to create more wealth and opportunity for working class people.District 11: Ranked Choice: Surprisingly there are three qualified candidates you can rank! Each brings a different set of skills, experience and community connection. Each also brings with them some concerns about accountability to whom and for what. I ranked in order of most likely to be a bridge builder between communities and least likely to fall into SF politics as usual.*Please know that these are simply suggestions to bring out the best outcome. This does not mean alignment of values or personal integrity or constitute an endorsement.Propositions: Lettered propositions are local for San Francisco, and numbered propositions are statewide for California.These are the laws and policies that matter. This is where we help shape the city we want!Prop A: YES - Schools Improvement and Safety Bond: This bond will pay for needed updates to help bring and protect clean water in school and make needed repairs to school buildings, classrooms and children's play areas at schools. This also helps SFUSD build a central food hub to help provide food to our children.Prop B: YES - Community Health and Medical Facilities, Street Safety, Public Spaces, and Shelter Bond: This bond will provide needed funds to support the repair and renovation and improve the health and safety of San Francisco streets and service facilities.Prop C: Yes - Inspector General for San Francisco: This measure creates an Inspector General position in the controllers offices and expands the oversight and enforcement power of the Controller's Office to investigate financial problems and corruption. This is a good step to better government.Prop D: NO!!! - City Commissions and Mayoral Authority: This measure is very dangerous, deceptive and problematic. It eliminates the opportunity for the public to participate in government. It removes any oversight of police conduct and gives the mayor complete control over every department in the city without any oversight from the Board of Supervisors or the public. This will over politicize every department in the city making every position appointed by the mayor. It will create a layer of politics over every aspect of city management. Say NO to this power grab by the police and the mayor who want no accountability.Prop E: Yes - Creating a Task Force to Recommend Changing, Eliminating, or Combining City Commissions: This measure allows the city to convene a taskforce to review and make recommendations to increase efficiency in city commissions and bring any major structural or policy changes to the voters.Prop F: NO! - Police Staffing and Deferred Retirement: This measure will allow SFPD to keep and bring back retired police to make large amounts of overtime pay with no employment accountability. In addition this measure would have the city pay five years of interest on top of the retirement they already receive. We don't need more old cops who can act with impunity and no consequences. This measure is too costly and keeps the same cops who need to retire coming back. VOTE NO on PROP F.Prop G: Yes - Funding Rental Subsidies for Affordable Housing Developments Serving Low Income Seniors, Families, and Persons with Disabilities: This measure is a short term relief, not a long term solution. Better rent control and vacancy controls are needed to significantly address the housing affordability crisis. We do too much to enable greed.Prop H: Yes - Firefighter Retirement: This measure will make the retirement age 55 years old for SF firefighters.Prop I: Yes - Retirement Benefits for Nurses and 911 Operators: This measure would recognize the work nurses and 911 operators do and allow them to contribute more to their retirement.Prop J: Yes - Funding Programs Serving Children, Youth, and Families: Both the current mayor and superintendent are not the best to lead this initiative' however, it does increase the city's commitment to San Francisco's children and youth.Prop K: No -Permanently Closing the Upper Great Highway to Private Vehicles to Establish a Public Open Recreation Space: This measure reduces access to the beach and recreation on the Great Highway at Ocean Beach area for people with disabilities and seniors. This is not good city planning.Prop L: Yes -- Additional Business Tax on Transportation Network Companies and Autonomous Vehicle Businesses to Fund Public Transportation: UBER, LYFT and WAYMO need to contribute more to SF. They are currently allowed to surge prices in an unlimited way, taking advantage of riders when convenient. The least they can do is pay an appropriate business tax to fund public transportation costs for the streets they use for profit.Prop M: Yes - Changes to Business Taxes: This measure will change some of the weights and thresholds for our business gross receipt taxes to support small business resulting in a loss of revenue for the city (for three years) allowing more small businesses to thrive. But the measure will ultimately increase revenue in the following years from larger, more profitable businesses.Prop N: No - First Responder Student Loan and Training Reimbursement Fund: This measure will exclude educators, nurses and so many who need student loan relief,while at the same time taking away needed revenue to provide critical city services. This is not a solution and takes on what should be the responsibility of the state of California. While I support student loan relief, it should come from the state and federal government.Prop O: Yes - Supporting Reproductive Rights: This measure will protect the privacy of people seeking medical attention, provide better signage and helpful online resources to people in need regarding reproductive health. The measure also creates a way for the city to collect private funding and increase the rental spaces available for reproductive health clinics.Prop 2: Yes - Repair and Construction Bond for Public Schools and Community Colleges: Allows the state to raise and borrow money to repair and build for public schools and community colleges across the state.Prop 3: Yes - Constitutional Right to Marriage: for all peoples regardless of race or genderProp 4: Yes - Safe Drinking Water, Wildfire Prevention and Climate Protection Bond: Allows the state to borrow money to repair and build for safe public drinking water, climate and wildfire protection across the state.Prop 5: YES - Allow Voters to Fund Affordable Housing and Public Projects Locally with 55% of voter approval: Restores voting power to a majority of California voters to fund affordable housing and various public works projects locally with 55% of the vote.Prop 6: Yes - Eliminates Slavery in Prisons: This proposition will not allow prison labor to be exploited by corporations or any private interest. This is long overdue considering slavery is a violation of human rights even of those in prisonProp 32: YES - Raises Minimum Wage in California to $17/hour in 2024 and $18/hour in 2025: Finally minimum wage in California will get a boost to match the high cost of living and recent inflation that is strapping the working class of this country.Prop 33: YES - Allows Rent Control to Be Set Locall: Expands the power of local government to enact rent control and vacancy control to help the affordability crisis locally.Prop 34: NO - Restricts Spending of Prescription Drug Revenue by Certain Health Care Providers: This proposition would restrict the funding of safety net health care providers who serve and offer prescription drug discounts and services to California's most vulnerable and low income people and leave massive funding gaps in other areas. It also burdens health care providers with unnecessary administrative and reporting tasks that would overwhelm especially smaller clinics for access to funds that they could not then use to support the newly required administrative tasks. This measure is too restrictive and does not allow money to go where it is most needed in the healthcare system.Prop 35: Yes - Provides Permanent Funding for Medi-Cal Health Care Services: This proposition will keep in place current funding sources for some Medi-Cal health care programs and services.Prop 36: No - Allows Felony Charges and Extreme Penalties for any Theft, Shoplifting and Possessing Certain Drugs: This proposition would allow people who steal any item valued less than $940, as small as a candy bar, with a felony (federal crime) and increase jail and prison sentences for theft and certain drug use. This proposed law would ensure that anyone who has ever felt desperate enough to steal, no matter how small, could be given a federal charge that would make it harder for them to find honest work or turn their lives around. This is a mean spirited law to penalize the poor, desperate, depressed and vulnerable for failures of our system to provide affordable housing, adequate jobs, living wages and much needed mental health services. While shoplifting and petty crime are a problem, this goes too far and will create more problems, expand our prison population and overtax our broken judicial system.",

    "title": "Ripple Co-Founder Donates $1 Million in Crypto to Kamala Harris Campaign",
    "content": "Future Forward USA PAC's use of crypto highlights a shift towards digital assets in political fundraising.Chris Larsen, Ripple's co-founder, has donated $1 million to support Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign. The donation was made in cryptocurrency, making it his first known cryptocurrency contribution to Harris' campaign. Larsen's donation to Future Forward USA PAC consisted of around 1.75 million XRP tokens.The donation comes at an important moment for both Ripple and the 2024 US presidential race. Ripple has been involved in a legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) since 2020.The SEC argues that Ripple raised $1.3 billion through unregistered digital asset sales. While the courts ruled in Ripple's favor for XRP secondary market transactions, Ripple's sales to institutional investors were found to violate securities laws.Larsen's support for Harris is important because of the high-profile court case. As crypto becomes more important in politics, it's clear that crypto policies will shape future administrations. Both Kamala and Trump are now accepting crypto donations. Donald Trump has pledged to support the crypto industry.Future Forward USA, one of Harris' most prominent PACs, has now received $200 million, with contributions from Larsen and other notable figures like Reid Hoffman and Michael Bloomberg. The PAC accepts crypto donations through Coinbase Commerce, which are converted into stablecoins to protect the funds from market volatility. Larsen's contribution gives Harris' campaign a boost, highlighting the growing importance of digital assets in politics.Cryptocurrency has become an important topic in the highly anticipated 2024 US presidential election. Kamala Harris' support from Chris Larsen may increase her appeal to pro-crypto voters. The evolving regulatory landscape will likely see further alignment between digital assets and politics.",

    "title": "What does the Catholic Church teach about lying?",
    "content": "As with any U.S. election season, the 2024 presidential election is filled with endless \"fact checks\" and accusations of falsehoods against various politicians. Separating lies from facts is ultimately up to the voter and lying may seem unimportant these days in the grand scheme of things, but what does the Catholic Church teach about it?Unsurprisingly, after 20 centuries, the Church has a lot to say about lying, one of the most common phenomena of the human experience.One of the Ten Commandments is \"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor\" and the Catechism of the Catholic Church states: \"Lying is to speak or act against the truth in order to lead someone into error\" (No. 2483).\"By injuring man's relation to truth and to his neighbor, a lie offends against the fundamental relation of man and of his word to the Lord,\" the catechism continues.The catechism notes in No. 2484 that a lie's severity \"is measured against the nature of the truth it deforms\" and that one must consider \"the circumstances, the intentions of the one who lies, and the harm suffered by its victims.\" A lie that constitutes a venial sin \"becomes mortal when it does grave injury to the virtues of justice and charity.\"Some of the Church's most towering thinkers have similarly condemned lying. St. Thomas Aquinas said lying was \"directly and formally opposed to the virtue of truth.\"St. Augustine, meanwhile, argued that \"whoever shall think there is any sort of lie that is not sin, will deceive himself foully, while he deems himself honest as a deceiver of other men.\"There seems to be little disagreement among moral authorities as to the wrongness of lying in general. But there has been some debate as to whether or not some types of falsehoods can be justified in certain circumstances, such as when telling some or all of the truth would bring about unjust harm against innocents.One fabled example concerns St. Athanasius, who legend has it was rowing away from his persecutors on a river. When he encountered a group of searchers who asked if he knew where Athanasius was located, he reportedly responded: \"He's not far away!\" after which he was able to flee.Other examples involve similarly extreme circumstances, such as if a murderous villain demands to know the location of an innocent person he intends to kill.Patrick Lee, a professor of philosophy at Franciscan University of Steubenville in Ohio, told CNA: \"My view is that St. Thomas and St. Augustine and the catechism are right, that all lying is wrong.\"He acknowledged that there are \"difficulties\" in that prohibition, such as the famous example of someone hiding Jewish refugees in their home and having to respond to Nazis searching for them.Still, \"the rules are really, really clear in Scripture,\" he argued. He cited Jesus' sharp words in John 8 in which Christ points out that Satan \"does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him,\" that in lying the devil \"speaks according to his own nature,\" and that he \"is a liar and the father of lies.\"\"It really does sound like you have an obligation to the truth,\" Lee said. Satan, he argued, \"is the source of lying -- all lying.\"Nevertheless, there have been attempts among Catholic thinkers over the years to justify some forms of lying or dishonesty. The Jesuits many years ago popularized the practice of \"mental reservation,\" a controversial philosophical principle that critics have argued is tantamount to lying.Jimmy Akin, a senior apologist at Catholic Answers, told CNA that when practicing mental reservation, \"one says something that is technically true but withholds or reserves part of the truth.\"(Story continues below)\"On the basis of this partial disclosure of truth, the person to whom one is speaking may draw an incorrect conclusion, but one would not have said something technically false and thus not lied,\" he said.An example of mental reservation could be when an abusive husband demands to know where his wife is hiding. The woman's protector might respond, \"I have not seen your wife,\" while thinking to himself, \"...in the last 30 seconds.\"\"The concept of mental reservation has been criticized on the ground that many mental reservations involve telling a truth in a deliberately misleading way and thus involve deliberate deception, making them functionally equivalent to lying,\" Akin said.Akin noted that in recent years some Catholic moral theologians \"have been exploring other theories that seek to balance the importance of truth-telling with the seeming practical need to use deception in some circumstances.\"\"This may be in part a response to the totalitarian regimes that arose in the 20th century and the need to deceive them in order to protect human life,\" he said.The idea of using falsehoods to save innocent victims from violent aggressors received renewed attention several years ago when Pope Francis admitted that, as a young priest in Argentina, he participated in what it could be argued were false and duplicitous actions as part of efforts to work against the dictatorship there.Akin wrote in 2013 that the faithful should be \"cautious of drawing implications from this,\" in part because \"people can and do make mistakes.\" Additionally, at the time, Francis \"was not yet pope and did not have the responsibility and the graces of that office.\"He pointed out to CNA, however, that at one point the Catechism of the Catholic Church qualified its prohibition on lying: It previously held that \"to lie is to speak or act against the truth in order to lead into error someone who has the right to know the truth.\" The \"right-to-know\" proviso was removed in 1997.\"To my knowledge, the Holy See didn't comment on the reason for the change,\" Akin said, \"but it presumably was to avoid adopting one, specific, recent theory of lying when others were still legitimate also.\"The older directive \"seemed to support a theory in moral theology that would permit lying in cases where the person had no right to know the truth, such as in the famous example of lying to Nazis about the location of hidden Jewish individuals,\" Akin said.Lee said lying represents a fundamental betrayal of the person to whom you are telling the falsehood.\"You're inviting someone to trust you that what you're saying is in your mind,\" he said. \"So you, in a way, betray that trust. You ask them to believe you in the sense that what you're saying is what you think. You're presenting a false self and blocking community with them.\"Akin, meanwhile, pointed out that \"historically, the most prominent view has been the one supported by St. Thomas Aquinas.\"\"He held that lying is intrinsically wrong as a perversion of the human faculty of speech, which he saw as oriented toward communicating truthful information in a way that would preclude lying,\" Akin said.\"On his view, lying is never permissible, and so one could not lie to Nazis about hiding Jews in one's attic. One would have to do something else.\"\"Examples of things a non-exception-making Thomist might do include shutting the door in the Nazis' faces without saying anything or using a mental reservation of some kind,\" he said.\"The difficulty for the Thomist,\" Akin pointed out, \"is finding something that would be effective (if you shut the door, the Nazis may just kick it in and search the house) and that would not involve deliberate deception (as many mental reservations do).\"",
