    "title": "Your guide to the presidential candidates' views on abortion",
    "content": "Abortion rights, always a polarizing issue in American politics, became an electoral tinderbox in 2022 after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision to create a federal right to abortion access. Democrats have seized upon the issue of women's bodily autonomy, notably in the 2024 presidential election, in part because it could motivate the critical bloc of suburban women voters in swing states.The prospect of women not having access to abortion was theoretical in many voters' minds until the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which set in motion a domino effect of widely varying laws about abortion in the states. As of June, 14 states had enacted total bans on the medical procedure, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research organization that supports abortion access.Other states have enacted restrictions at various stages in pregnancy. The end result of all of the laws is many American women traveling to receive reproductive care, more than 171,000 in 2023, according to the institute. ProPublica reported on Sept. 16 that two Georgia women died after being unable to access legal abortion and timely medical care there, including a 28-year-old single mother who traveled to another state to obtain a prescription for a medical abortion, but then had rare complications because the fetal tissue was not fully expelled from her body.Care that is routinely provided in such situations was significantly delayed, resulting in Amber Nicole Thurman getting a sepsis infection that caused her blood pressure to plummet and her organs to fail, according to the ProPublica report. Twenty hours later, after doctors decided to operate, her heart stopped. A state committee focused on pregnancy-related fatalities concluded that her death was \"preventable.\"Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris weighed in the day after the report was published, saying that such tragedies are the direct result of former President Trump's Supreme Court appointees who voted to strike down Roe.\"This young mother should be alive, raising her son, and pursuing her dream of attending nursing school,\" the vice president said in a statement. \"In more than 20 states, Trump Abortion Bans are preventing doctors from providing basic medical care. Women are bleeding out in parking lots, turned away from emergency rooms, losing their ability to ever have children again. Survivors of rape and incest are being told they cannot make decisions about what happens next to their bodies. And now women are dying. These are the consequences of Donald Trump's actions.\"There have also been multiple reports of woman suffering miscarriages and other medical emergencies who struggled to get care.Republicans, including Trump, have claimed that Harris and running mate Tim Walz support allowing babies to be killed after they are born. Trump repeated that false assertion during the September presidential debate.\"It's an execution,\" Trump said, claiming that Democrats support allowing babies to be killed in the final months of pregnancy and after they are born.It is illegal to kill babies after they are born in every state, and extremely rare late-term abortions typically occur because the baby's health is severely compromised and the baby is not viable, or because of threats to the health of the woman.Abortions after 21 weeks, considered late-term pregnancies, account for less than 1% of abortions, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 80% of abortions occur in the first nine weeks of pregnancy, and 6% occur during the second trimester.In the aftermath of the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, questions immediately arose about whether Congress would enact legislation protecting abortion access across the nation or a federal measure prohibiting such rights.Trump has vacillated on whether or not he would sign a federal abortion ban, but he has said that he would support a federal prohibition after a certain length of pregnancy. The former president has also stated that Americans broadly support the issue being decided by the states, which is decisively refuted by all reliable public polling.\"Look, this is an issue that's torn our country apart for 52 years,\" Trump said during the debate. \"Every legal scholar, every Democrat, every Republican ... they all wanted this issue to be brought back to the states where the people could vote, and that's what happened.\"Each individual state is voting. It's the vote of the people,\" Trump said.Harris argues that Trump is untrustworthy on the issue, and she vocally supports federal legislation allowing abortions until a fetus could survive outside the uterus, and later if required for medical reasons. The first White House official to visit an abortion clinic, Harris has called Trump's actions on abortion \"unconscionable.\"\"It's insulting to the women of America,\" Harris said. \"Understand what has been happening under Donald Trump's abortion bans. Couples who pray and dream of having a family are being denied IVF treatments. What is happening in our country, working people, working women who are working one or two jobs who can barely afford child care as it is, have to travel to another state, to get on a plane, sitting next to strangers to go and get the healthcare she needs.\"A president's power to reshape the Supreme Court took on greater importance when Trump narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016. Senate Republicans refused to even consider President Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to fill the seat of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia after Scalia died in February 2016 -- nine months before the election.That set the stage for Trump to fill Scalia's seat and two others -- the last of his picks, Amy Coney Barrett, was confirmed just a week before the 2020 election -- paving the path to Roe being overturned, which the former president frequently boasts about.\"Now it's not tied up in the federal government,\" Trump said. \"I did a great service in doing it. It took courage to do it, and the Supreme Court had great courage in doing it, and I give tremendous credit to those six justices\" who voted to overturn the landmark abortion ruling.Harris has lashed out at Trump for appointing the justices who supported overturning federal protection for abortion rights.\"Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade -- and they did exactly as he intended,\" she said.",

    "title": "Why the presidential debate is a turning point for betting markets",
    "content": "The presidential debate is a pivotal moment in any U.S. election campaign. It's more than just candidates going head-to-head -- it's a showdown between them and the expectations of millions of voters.These debates can also shake up the political betting markets, particularly regarding the futures bet on the presidential election, where odds can shift dramatically depending on a candidate's performance.The presidential debates: Their powerOne of the few times candidates can directly communicate with millions of voters before election day in real time is in presidential debates. Debates are a critical turning point in many elections, both in terms of candidates shoring up the strengths of their campaigns or exposing their weaknesses. Voters want more than just policy details, they want to know how well a candidate will perform on the stage, in demeanor, on personality, and how well they can think on their feet. A debate performance can be a building block to a candidate's confidence or a source of doubt regarding a candidate's ability to lead.Fast forward to today's social media and real-time reaction era, debates have even more impact, especially when you bet on the election. For example, certain moments, whether gaffes, wit-filled answers, or policy turns, can spread like wildfire, influencing public opinion virtually in an instant. There is a lot at stake and one misstep during a debate can be a killer for a campaign.Political betting markets and how they are affected by debatesLike presidential polling, political betting markets respond to what happens in these debates. That has meant bettors and analysts watch debate performances looking for clues that could shift the 2024 presidential election odds. A good performance in the debate can help a candidate rise in the betting markets, while a bad performance can see their odds lose ground.The shifting odds reflect the changing dynamic of the race and often make it tougher for anyone making a futures bet on the presidential election because of the many factors leading up to the vote taking place.BetUS and other betting platforms are very close to all these changes and will keep it up to date with the latest odds, letting political bettors know how well each candidate performs in the debates, but also what the public and the media think about the performance.Factors that influence debate outcomesSeveral factors determine whether a candidate's debate performance will be seen as successful or damaging:Public perception: Policy points can matter less than how a candidate present themself. Specific policy details aren't necessarily what voters connect with; they respond more to confidence, poise, and a clear message.Memorable moments: A debate can be defined by gaffes or a standout moment. One-liners, or major missteps, can overshadow policy discussions and dominate the post debate conversation.Fact-checking: Fact-checking is now a critical part of how the public sees the world. If candidates are caught lying or making bogus claims and statements, they can be stomped on immediately by the voters and the media.Handling pressure: Debates are high pressure environments and candidates have to show they can take it; that they can answer tough questions, take personal attacks and unexpected developments in their stride without losing their cool.What it means in 2024This will be one of the most contentious and closely watched elections in recent history and will happen on a deeply polarized political landscape. Even after the most recent debates, early polling data and 2024 presidential election odds indicate it is going to be a highly-competitive race.",

    "title": "Venezuela: UN Rights Council Extends Probe as Crisis Deepens - Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)",
    "content": "Diplomatic Pressure Remains Essential Amid Post-Electoral Repression(Geneva) -The United Nations Human Rights Council, in extending its Venezuela probe, has sent a clear message to those responsible for ongoing abuses, including in the context of post-electoral repression, that they will be held to account, Human Rights Watch said today.On October 11, 2024, the council adopted a resolution extending the mandate of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission (FFM) on Venezuela for two years. The mission was among the first international bodies to assert that Venezuelan authorities have engaged in serious human rights violations that could amount to crimes against humanity. The resolution also asks the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue to monitor and report on the human rights situation in the country.\"The decision to extend the fact-finding mission's mandate is pivotal given the heightened post-electoral repression in Venezuela,\" said Juanita Goebertus, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. \"Through this resolution, council members have sent the message that they won't stand by as Maduro's forces kill and abuse people to stay in power and that they are committed to holding Venezuelan authorities accountable for their crimes.\"The Human Rights Council established the FFM in 2019 to investigate \"extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions and torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment since 2014,\" with a view to \"ensuring full accountability for perpetrators and justice for victims.\" Its mandate has been renewed twice, in October 2020 and October 2022.In September, 30 national and international organizations defending human rights in Venezuela, including Human Rights Watch, urged the council to renew the mandate of the FFM again this year.The resolution, presented by a group of regional governments -- Canada, Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Guatemala, Paraguay, and Uruguay -- was adopted by a vote of 23 to 6, with 18 abstentions. An increase in supportive votes compared to the last resolution in 2022 suggests growing international concern about the deepening rights crisis.This time, Cuba, Belarus, and Russia introduced hostile amendments that would have undermined the initiative, including amendments that, if adopted, would have terminated the Mission's mandate, labeled Venezuelans on the move purely as migrants and not refugees, and weakened the high commissioner's ability to provide timely updates on the developing human rights situation in Venezuela to the Council. Council members overwhelmingly voted to reject all these proposed amendments.This resolution also asks the mission to investigate repression following the July 2024 presidential election, including violence by pro-government armed groups known as colectivos.The resolution expresses alarm at \"worsening human rights violations and abuses and increasing restrictions of civic and democratic space, particularly in the presidential elections.\" It notes that a \"Venezuelan-led solution requires respecting the will of the Venezuelan people.\"On July 28, Venezuelans voted in the presidential election in large numbers, despite irregular government actions and human rights violations. International observers raised serious concerns about the announcement by Venezuela's electoral authority that Nicolás Maduro had been re-elected president.Following the announcement, thousands of protesters took to the streets in largely peaceful protests to demand a fair counting of the votes. People, including in low-income areas traditionally supportive of the Chavismo political movement from which Maduro emerged, protested in large numbers. Authorities responded with violence and widespread abuses, including killings, arbitrary detention and prosecution, and harassment of critics.Human Rights Watch received credible reports of 23 killings of protesters and bystanders and identified evidence linking security forces and colectivos with several of these killings. As of September 30, the local group Foro Penal reported 1,767 \"political prisoners\" who had been arrested since July 29, including 67 adolescents who remain behind bars.In its most recent report to the council, in September, the FFM said that following the elections, the government had \"reactivated and intensified the harshest and most violent mechanisms of its repressive apparatus,\" generating a \"widespread climate of fear among the population.\"The FFM concluded that they had reasonable grounds to believe that some of the violations they have investigated over the past year \"were committed following the same course of conduct that the mission qualified in previous reports as crimes against humanity.\" In previous reports, the mission has identified people \"at presidential and ministerial level,\" as well as \"the directors of the security and intelligence entities,\" who should be investigated for their criminal responsibility in that regard. It also consistently highlighted the judiciary's involvement and the state's repressive tactics targeting opposition members or those perceived as such, alongside the lack of real reform in law enforcement institutions.Following the adoption of this resolution, foreign governments should take further steps to support the Venezuelan people, Human Rights Watch said. The European Union and the US government should continue to use their leverage, including targeted sanctions, to press the Maduro government to respect the will of the people and human rights.The governments of Presidents Gustavo Petro in Colombia and Luíz Inacio Lula da Silva in Brazil should continue assertive efforts to urge Maduro to respect the will of the people, as expressed in the polls, and to respect human rights. They should also explore ways to encourage Maduro's international allies, including Cuba, to refrain from supporting repression.Governments should also support the ongoing investigation of the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court into crimes against humanity in Venezuela and ensure that the court has the resources it needs to support work across its docket. They should also expand access to asylum and other forms of international protection for Venezuelans leaving their country in line with international standards.",

    "title": "Kamala Harris Has a Plan for Black Men. Trump Never Did",
    "content": "\"Black Vote, Black Power,\" a collaboration between Keith Boykin and Word In Black,examines the issues, the candidates, and what's at stake for Black America in the 2024 presidential election.On Monday Kamala Harris unveiled a new agenda for Black men. The plan is extensive, but I want to highlight 10 specific steps she would take as president that would empower Black men with the tools we need to build wealth, provide for our families, and lead our communities.Number 1. Business Loans. Black Americans are twice as likely to be denied credit by banks, so Harris would provide 1 million fully forgivable loans of up to $20,000 to Black entrepreneurs and others who have historically faced barriers to starting a new business or growing an existing one.Number 2. More Jobs Without College Degrees. Harris would eliminate unnecessary degree requirements and promote pathways for those without college degrees for 500,000 federal jobs.Number 3. More Black Male Teachers. As a former high school English and social studies teacher, I know it's important for young Black males to see Black men in front of the classroom as role models and mentors. Only 1% of public school teachers are Black men, so Harris would create pathways for more Black men to become teachers, including apprenticeship programs and loan forgiveness.RELATED: Obama's Challenge to Black Men -- Don't Fall for Trump's LiesNumber 4. Health Care. My uncle, who had sickle cell disease, died last year, and I know several Black men my age who have been recently diagnosed with prostate cancer. And don't get me started on the mental health needs of the Black men in my family and community. I see it every day. We've been traumatized by an unfair criminal justice system and a world that demonizes us instead of understanding us. Fortunately, Harris would launch a National Health Equity Initiative focused on Black men that addresses sickle cell disease, diabetes, mental health, and prostate cancer.Number 5. Weed Equity. Black men have been disproportionately arrested and incarcerated for marijuana-related charges. Now that cannabis is becoming more socially acceptable and profitable, it's only fair that we benefit from the changing system that hurt us. Vice President Harris not only wants to legalize recreational marijuana but also create opportunities for Black Americans to succeed in this new industry.Number 6. Ban the Box. I have a law degree, and yet when I lived in Harlem, I was still stopped on the street, arrested, and locked up in jail. I know Black men have been targeted by a racist criminal justice system. Harris would work with Congress to require businesses to limit the unnecessary use of criminal arrest histories, convictions, and credit scores in employment decisions.RELATED: 10 Ways to Be a Better Black VoterNumber 7. Mentorship Programs. Harris would expand funding for community mentorship programs with a proven track record of helping young Black men succeed. She will also support programs like My Brother's Keeper.Number 8. Support Black Farmers. Harris would continue to support Black farmers and ranchers who have been denied access to capital. As vice president, she already distributed funding to thousands of Black farmers and ranchers in a $2 billion relief package.\nNumber 9. Relieve Medical Debt. My stepfather passed away in April 2020 , with a mountain of medical debt. Vice President Harris plans to work with states to relieve medical debt, which is the leading cause of bankruptcy in America, and disproportionately hurts Black Americans.And Number 10. Crypto Protection. More than 20% of Black Americans, including me, have owned cryptocurrency assets. I lost money in crypto, but the high-risk, high-reward crypto markets provide opportunities outside of the existing stock market for many Black men. A Harris administration would support a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency and other digital assets to protect Black men who invest in these assets.Question 1. Why didn't she do this in the last four years? Because she's not the president. She's the vice president. Trump was actually a president, and he did none of these things in his four years in office.Question 2. But why do some of these policies say Black men \"and others\"? Why aren't they all Black-specific? Well, because Trump's Supreme Court Justices and federal judges keep striking down programs that focus on Black people? Trump's Supreme Court ended race-specific affirmative action in college admissions. A Trump-appointed federal judge forced the Minority Business Development Agency to help white people. Another Trump-appointed federal judge blocked a disaster relief program for Black farmers. And two Trump-appointed federal judges in Georgia blocked a private program by the Fearless Fund to help Black women in business.RELATED: With a Trump Win, Republican Judges Will Rule the Courts -- and Our LivesIf Trump's judges won't allow a private group of Black women to help each other, do you think they're going to let a government program that only helps Black men and excludes others? No. But this is what happens when we don't vote. So we have to create clever ways to get around the Trump MAGA Republican bans on helping Black people.Question 3. Yeah, but why does it feel like Democrats only care about Black women? Yes, Joe Biden elevated two very prominent Black women in the past four years:VP Kamala Harris and Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. But the Democratic Party is filled with Black men in positions of power and leadership. The highest-ranking Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives is Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who will become the first Black Speaker if Democrats win the House in November. The highest ranking leader in the military is Lloyd Austin, the first Black Secretary of Defense. Two of the three Democratic Black U.S. senators -- Raphael Warnock and Cory Booker -- are Black men. The Democratic governor of Maryland, Wes Moore, is a Black man. The mayors of New York City, Chicago, and Atlanta are all Black men in the Democratic Party. And the only Black person ever elected president, Barack Obama, is also a Black man.And Question 4: But isn't Trump better for Black men? Was he better for Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, and Korey Wise -- the Exonerated Five teenagers who went to prison when Trump led a lynch mob against them for a rape they did not commit, and then refused to apologize after they were exonerated by DNA evidence? Was he better for the Black casino workers who sued him for racial discrimination? Was he better for Colin Kapernick and the NFL players he attacked for taking a knee? Was he better for Eugene Goodman, the Capitol Police Officer who had to fend off a mob of angry white Trump supporters who tried to take over the Capitol on January 6? Was he better for the Haitian American Black men in Springfield, Ohio, who were subjected to death threats because of Trump's lies about them eating dogs and cats? Was he better for Marcellus Williams, the Black man who was executed by the State of Missouri last month because Donald Trump's three Supreme Court Justices refused to agree with the Democratic Justices to stop the execution? Was he better for the Black farmers denied relief by his judges? Was he better for the Black men who died while he mismanaged the COVID pandemic? And will he be better for the Black youth who will be harassed by the police when he brings back stop and frisk?Kamala Harris wants to help Black men build wealth, provide for our families, and lead our communities. Trump wants to use us as political pawns in his angry MAGA campaign. Those are the choices. Choose wisely.Keith Boykin is a New York Times-bestselling author, TV and film producer, and former CNN political commentator.

    "title": "A devastating hurricane doesn't dramatically change how people vote - but in a close election, it can matter",
    "content": "North Carolina and Florida are changing administrative rules and, in some cases, issuing emergency funding that is intended to make it easier for people in areas damaged by Hurricanes Helene and Milton to vote.The recovery in both states is expected to extend far beyond the November 2024 election period. The majority of the people in the affected communities in North Carolina and Florida voted for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in 2020, making some election analysts wonder if some Trump supporters will be able to cast their ballots.Amy Lieberman, a politics and society editor at The Conversation U.S., spoke with Boris Heersink, a scholar of voters' behavior after a natural disaster, to better understand if and how the recent hurricanes could shift the results of the 2024 presidential election.A massive hurricane disrupts people's lives in many important ways, including affecting people's personal safety and where they can live. Ahead of an election, there are a lot of practical limitations about how an election can be executed - like if a person can still receive mail-in ballots at home or elsewhere, or if it is possible to still vote in person at their polling location if that building was destroyed or damaged.Another issue is whether people who have just lived through a natural disaster and will likely be dealing with the aftermath for weeks to come are focused on politics right now. Some might sit out the election because they simply have more important things to worry about.The other side of the equation, which is what political scientists like myself are mostly focusing on, is whether people take the fact that a natural disaster happened into consideration when they vote.Two scholars, Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels, have argued that sometimes voters are not great at figuring out how to incorporate bad things that happened to them into a voting position. In some cases, it is entirely fair to hold an elected official responsible for bad outcomes that affect people's lives. But at other moments, bad things can happen to us without that being the fault of an incumbent president or governor. And voters should ideally be able to balance out these different types of bad things - those it is fair to punish elected officials for, and those for which it isn't fair to hold them responsible.After all, a devastating hurricane is terrible, but it is not Kamala Harris' fault that it happened. But Achen and Bartels argue that voters frequently still punish elected officials for random bad events like this.Their most famous example is the consequences of a series of shark attacks off the New Jersey coast in the summer of 1916. As a result of those attacks, the New Jersey tourism industry saw a major decline. While these findings are still being debated, Achen and Bartels argue that Jersey shore voters subsequently voted against Woodrow Wilson in the 1916 presidential election at a higher rate than they would have had the shark attacks not happened. They argue that voters did this even though Wilson had no involvement in the shark attacks.Scholars like John Gasper and Andrew Reeves argue that voters mostly care whether elected officials respond appropriately to a disaster. So, if the president does a good job reacting, voters do not actually punish them at all in the next election. However, voters can punish elected officials if they feel like the response is not correct.The fact that Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana in 2005 was not the fault of then-President George W. Bush. But the perceived slowness of the government response is something a voter could have held him responsible for.Colleagues and I have shown that how people interpret the combination of a disaster and the government response is likely colored by their own partisanship.We looked at both the effects of Superstorm Sandy on the 2012 presidential election and natural disasters' impact on elections more broadly from 1972 through 2004. One core finding is that when presidents reject state officials' disaster declaration requests, they lose votes in affected counties - but only if those counties were already more supportive of the opposite party.If there is a strong positive government response, the incumbent president or their party can actually gain votes or lose voters affected by a disaster. So, Republicans affected by the hurricanes could become more inclined to vote against Harris if they feel like they are not getting the help they need. But it could also help Harris if affected Democrats feel like they are getting enough aid.The major takeaway is that if the government responds really effectively to a natural disaster or other emergency, there is not a huge electoral penalty - and there could even be a small reward.That is not irrelevant in a close election. If Republicans in affected areas in North Carolina feel the government response has been poor and it inspires them to turn out in higher numbers to punish Harris, that could matter. But if they feel like the response has been adequate, research suggests either no real effect on their support for Harris - or possibly even an increase in Harris voters.Scholars mostly assume that people affected can tell whether the government response was good or not. Trump and other Republicans are falsely saying that the response is slow and falsely claiming that Federal Emergency Management Agency money is being spent on immigrants who are not living in the country legally. There does not appear to be a slow government response to the hurricane in North Carolina, and there's no evidence the response is insufficient in Florida, either.So, the question now is whether voters affected by these hurricanes will respond based on their actual lived experiences, or how they are told they are living their experience.",

    "content": "Donald Trump raged about the new film \"The Apprentice\" on Monday, calling the movie a \"pile of garbage\" made by \"human scum.\"The former president and GOP presidential nominee was fired up in his early-morning Truth Social post, where he railed against the screenwriter, journalist Gabe Sherman, and hoped that the \"fake and classless\" film would be a box office bomb.\"It's a cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country,\" Trump wrote in his post, which has a time stamp of 12:48 a.m. EST.Directed by Ali Abbasi, \"The Apprentice\" stars Sebastian Stan as a young Trump making a name for himself as a New York real estate developer, with \"Succession's\" Jeremy Strong as his mentor Roy Cohn.Premiering at this year's Cannes Film Festival, the controversial biopic portrays Trump as an amphetamine-addled slumlord, and includes a scene where he rapes his first wife, Ivana Trump (played by Maria Bakalova).Appearing to dispute the depiction in his post, Trump called Ivana \"a kind and wonderful person,\" and said he \"had a great relationship with her until the day she died.\"Ivana Trump, a Czech model turned businesswoman, did use the word \"rape\" to describe an incident detailed in her and Donald's high-profile 1990s divorce case, but later recanted the allegation. She died in 2022.In his Truth Social post, Trump attacked Sherman as \"the writer of this pile of garbage\" and \"a lowlife and talentless hack, who has long been widely discredited.\" He said Sherman \"chose to ignore\" what he said were the facts about his and Ivana's relationship.\"So sad that HUMAN SCUM, like the people involved in this hopefully unsuccessful enterprise, are allowed to say and do whatever they want in order to hurt a Political Movement, which is far bigger than any of us,\" Trump wrote.The former president's legal team tried and failed to block the film's release earlier this year, leaving \"The Apprentice\" struggling to find a distributor in the U.S.And though he was unable to stop the film from hitting theaters, Trump appears to be getting his wish regarding the box office.\"The Apprentice\" opened on Friday to weak ticket sales, taking in a meager $1.6 million, according to The Associated Press.",

    "title": "Could massive Trump crypto best be a ploy to challenge 2024 results?",
    "content": "Less than a month out from the 2024 presidential election, polls are tight in the race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.But over on prediction markets, the gap between Harris and Trump widened recently. On Polymarket, a crypto-fueled offshore marketplace that offers bets on the presidential election, Trump has jumped out to a huge lead.Another market, Predictit, is favoring Trump as well, but by a narrower margin.Trump's massive lead on Polymarket has some convinced the site isn't running a crypto betting pool, but rather an election influence operation, setting the stage for Trump to take office regardless of the results in November.The market there shows a 55% chance he will win and a 44.6% chance Harris will lose. For each candidate, gamblers can buy \"yes\" or \"no\" votes based on who they think will win or lose.Those predictions have been boosted recently by conservative influencers online as proof that Harris' campaign is flailing.But some liberals are pushing back against Polymarket as \"proof\" of shifting voter sentiment, pointing to the fact that it was funded by a key Trump booster.In May, Polymarket announced it raised $70 million in two recent rounds of investment, with a big boost coming from Founders Fund, a venture capital outfit led by Trump 2016 backer Peter Thiel.Thiel has been a crucial funder of Trump's vice presidential pick Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) over the years. Vance worked for Thiel in 2017 and Thiel funded Vance's own firm Narya Capital in 2020. In 2022 Thiel donated $15 million to Vance's successful Senate race in Ohio.Thiel, who previously spoke out against democracy, has declined to publicly support any candidate in 2024. Vance reportedly has been pressuring him to donate to Trump.Online, some people are pointing to the jump in support for Trump on the prediction market as evidence that Polymarket might be putting a heavy finger on the scale to create a narrative of inevitability about Trump getting elected.Others say that even if the strategy doesn't result in a Trump victory, it could lay the seeds for a narrative that the election was rigged against Trump.\"Polymarket is owned by Peter Thiel,\" posted @Cmmnsensedspnsr on X. \"The same Peter Thiel who is personally backing JD Vance and many other conservative causes. Polymarket is not independent, not unbiased, and skewing its data to favor one person over another.\"\"connect the dots: GOP Russian link backer Peter Thiel funded Polymarket, which is banned in the US, and hired @NateSilver538 ahead of the election to create an 'alternate' narrative about election being widely favored 4 Trump. This narrative would then be picked up by right-wing,\" added @SomaliAmerica, referring to former FiveThirtyEight founder Nate Silver, who joined Polymarket in July.Silver has also been a left-wing boogeyman over the years and sparked ire earlier this summer when he released his new election model predicting Trump would win.Betting on elections is against the law in the United States, which is why Polymarket operates offshore. In 2022, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) fined Polymarket $1.4 million for operating illegal event markets.In 2023, some Democratic senators wrote a letter to the CFTC warning another prediction market called Kalshi could potentially impact the election.\"Billionaires could expand their already outsized influence on politics by wagering extraordinary bets while simultaneously contributing to a specific candidate or party,\" they predicted. \"These bets could sway the outcome of our elections, undermining the voices of voters. If citizens believe that the democratic process is being influenced by those with financial stakes, it may further exacerbate the disenfranchisement and distrust of voters already facing our nation.\"Volume on Polymarket for the election is over $1.8 billion, and a plurality of it is coming from the Trump side. Gamblers spent $500 million on votes on Trump, and just over $370 million on the Harris side.That's led some people to point to some of the biggest movers in the markets as potentially buying shares for Trump to distort the market in his favor. One user, Fredi9999, has over 14 million yes shares as of Monday afternoon.\"The user is a fervent and wealthy supporter, crypto & tech savvy, who wants to back up his belief that Trump will win with a lot of money,\" posted @Domahhhh last week about Fredi, when he had around 8 million shares.Wrote one about the numbers, \"This smells like desperation. A single whale can shift the odds dramatically on polymarket. They're simply laying the groundwork for another 'stolen election' narrative,\" they said, flagging Elon Musk's tweet that called Polymarket \"More accurate than polls.\"Others were similarly convinced that the market movement was part of a plot.\"Political betting markets have always been skewed to the right, but now the billionaires are actively manipulating them to create the illusion that Trump has a clear advantage so that they can claim that the election was 'stolen' cheated if/when he loses,\" posted @BostonJerry.But other posters were more sanguine and viewed the prediction narrative as a distraction.\"People need to get out and vote and not pay attention to this nonsense -- the veracity of their ✌🏽\"polling\"✌🏽 is beyond questionable,\" wrote @rwiley55.",

Emmy and Tony winner Jeremy Strong also stars as driven and vicious lawyer and political fixer Roy Cohn, who mentors him. Maria Bakalova, an Oscar nominee for Borat Subsequent Moviefilm, plays Trump's late ex-wife, Ivana Trump.Trump laid into the film and its makers in ad hominem attacks. He and his team have threatened legal action against The Apprentice before, saying the film \"is pure malicious defamation.\" The Apprentice includes a controversial scene in which Stan's Trump assaults Ivana both physically and sexually. (Per a divorce deposition acquired by the biographer Harry Hurt III, Ivana accused her ex-husband of raping her in 1989, but then walked back the claim in 1993, saying that she did not want the word \"rape\" to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense, and telling CNN in 2015 that a Daily Beast story about her earlier allegations was \"totally without merit.\")On Truth Social, Trump maintained that he and his late wife had a healthy relationship. \"My former wife, Ivana, was a kind and wonderful person, and I had a great relationship with her until the day she died,\" he wrote. He ended his screed with his familiar refrain: \"MAGA2024!\"",

    "content": "United States presidential election approaches, three recent national polls reveal a tightly contested race between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.As the 2024 United States presidential election draws closer, three recent national polls highlight a closely contested race between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.With just over three weeks remaining until Election Day, these surveys reveal a tightening competition. Trump is making notable gains against Harris, who replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee earlier this year.The polls indicate that the race between Trump vs. Harris is now within the margin of error, reflecting a shift in momentum that could play a crucial role in the final days of the campaign, as mentioned in a report by Fox News.Here's a closer look at the latest survey results and what they suggest about the current state of the race.A recent ABC News/Ipsos poll of likely voters shows a narrow lead for Harris, at 50% compared to Trump's 48%. This marks a significant shift from last month when Harris held a six-point advantage over Trump. The poll reflects the narrowing gap between the two candidates, with Trump gaining ground as the campaign enters its final phase.Similarly, an NBC News survey of registered voters nationwide reveals a dead heat between the two candidates, each with 48% support. This represents a reversal from the previous month when Harris held a five-point lead. The tight numbers suggest that Trump's support has solidified as Election Day approaches, especially among his core base.Also Read : Agatha All Along Episode 6: Release date and time for US & UK | What to expectMeanwhile, a CBS News/YouGov poll of likely voters gives Harris a slim three-point edge over Trump, at 49% to 46%. This is down from a four-point advantage just a month ago, indicating that the race remains extremely competitive, as mentioned in a Fox News reportThe departure of President Joe Biden from the 2024 race significantly altered the dynamics of the election. After a challenging debate performance against Trump in late June, Biden withdrew from the race, prompting a quick rally around Harris as the new Democratic standard-bearer.Her campaign saw an initial boost in enthusiasm, with increased fundraising and positive shifts in favorability ratings, allowing her to gain a lead over Trump.However, as the campaign transitioned from summer into fall, Harris's momentum has slowed. Her favorability ratings have slipped, and the perception of her candidacy as a continuation of the Biden administration has persisted among voters.This shift has coincided with a resurgence of support for Trump, particularly among Republican voters returning to their party's nominee.Political analysts are divided on whether Trump's recent gains indicate true momentum or if they reflect a natural closing of the gap as Election Day approaches.David Paleologos, Director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center, emphasized the need for more data before drawing firm conclusions. \"It could be momentum, or it could be the natural closing of the gap in a very polarized country,\" he explained.Also Read : Rising tensions between Biden's and Harris's teams weeks before U.S electionsRepublican pollster Neil Newhouse, known for his work on GOP presidential campaigns, highlighted the challenges facing Harris. He argued that Harris's campaign is at risk of losing its initial advantage, saying she is \"on the verge of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory\" as her image falters and Trump gains traction.While national polls are valuable in understanding the overall race, the outcome of the 2024 presidential election will ultimately hinge on a handful of key battleground states. States like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Georgia, which played decisive roles in President Biden's 2020 victory, are once again under the spotlight.Polls from these swing states suggest that the Trump vs. Harris contest is also extremely close in these critical areas.Is Kamala Harris losing among Black Men?As per latest reports, Harris support has lowered among Black men but she is still ahead of Trump.When is the US Polls 2024?US Elections 2024 will be held on November 5.",

    "content": "The Las Vegas Review-Journal has officially endorsed former President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, citing his strong policy achievements during his time in office. Despite acknowledging voter dissatisfaction with the current political landscape, the editorial board argues that Trump's accomplishments are too significant to overlook.In a statement published Sunday, the newspaper recognized the frustration many Americans feel with their presidential options but pointed to Trump's economic and foreign policy successes as key reasons for their endorsement.\"Although many voters are dissatisfied with their choices for president, the policy results of Donald Trump's years in office are too strong to ignore,\" the editorial declared. \"From job creation to national security, Trump delivered real results that benefited the nation.\"The Las Vegas Review-Journal, one of the largest and most influential newspapers in Nevada, has a history of leaning conservative. Still, its endorsement of Trump, despite his polarizing persona, highlights the enduring appeal of his policy record to certain voter segments.During his tenure, Trump's administration saw significant tax cuts, record-low unemployment rates prior to the pandemic, and trade deals like the USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement), which replaced NAFTA. These accomplishments were praised by the paper as examples of Trump's effectiveness as a leader.While some critics point to Trump's controversial rhetoric and divisive political style, the editorial board emphasized that voters should focus on the substance of his policies rather than the noise surrounding his personality.\"Trump's approach may not have always been conventional, but the results speak for themselves,\" the paper stated. \"His economic policies strengthened the country, and his foreign policy initiatives ensured that America remained a dominant global player.\"This endorsement comes at a crucial moment in the 2024 campaign, with Nevada positioned as a key battleground state. Trump's appeal to working-class voters and his promises to address economic challenges have resonated with many Nevadans, particularly in the Las Vegas area, which has seen fluctuating economic fortunes in recent years.Despite the paper's praise for Trump, it acknowledged the dissatisfaction many voters feel toward both major candidates. \"The electorate is tired of the political bickering and personal attacks that have dominated the national conversation,\" the editorial said. \"But when it comes to delivering tangible results, Donald Trump stands out.\"However, the endorsement is not without controversy. Many Trump critics argue that his leadership style has contributed to the nation's deepening political divisions and question his ability to lead the country toward unity. Still, the Review-Journal remains firm in its belief that his policies were effective and can be again.The endorsement concluded by urging voters to focus on policy outcomes over personalities as they head to the polls in 2024. \"America needs strong leadership, and Donald Trump has proven he can provide it,\" the paper declared. \"This election is about results, and his track record is impossible to ignore.\"As Trump continues to rally support across the country, the endorsement from the Las Vegas Review-Journal could play a pivotal role in swaying undecided voters in Nevada and beyond.",

It is often viewed as the final opportunity for voters to participate, with many having already voted through early voting or by mail.In some states, mail-in ballots must be received by Election Day to be counted, while in others, as long as the ballots are postmarked by this date, they can be counted if they arrive later.Out of 538 electoral votes from the 50 states and the District of Columbia, this year's election will hinge on seven key battleground states: Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, often regarded as the crucial \"final boss.\"Pennsylvania has played a pivotal role in recent elections.Eight years ago, it was the last state called for Republican candidate Donald Trump before his victory was sealed with Wisconsin in the early hours after Election Day. Four years later, Democratic candidate Joe Biden's narrow win in Pennsylvania -- by about 80,000 votes out of more than 6.8 million cast -- was decisive, occurring four days after the polls closed.Winning Pennsylvania provides a crucial advantage, making it a central focus in campaign strategies.Nearly all of the approximately 160 million ballots cast in this year's U.S. election will be paper-based, and the vast majority will be tallied using machines.Election officials stress the importance of these machines, noting that without them, hand-counting such a large volume of ballots would be much more time-consuming, significantly more expensive for taxpayers, and prone to human error, which would require additional time and resources to correct.Despite this, the desire for human oversight remains strong. In Georgia, for instance, a recent directive from the state's election board sparked controversy by requiring poll workers to hand-count the total number of ballots. This ongoing debate underscores the tension between the efficiency of machines and the public's desire for human involvement in maintaining election integrity.Election recounts can be triggered by law, requested by a candidate, or ordered by a court, but they rarely alter the final result. According to Deb Otis from the nonpartisan organization Fair Vote, \"Recounts typically shift only a very small number of votes.\"On average, recounts change the vote margin by just 0.03 percentage points, with the largest shift -- 0.11 points -- occurring in a 2006 Vermont state auditor race. In that case, a 137-vote lead for Republican Randy Brock flipped to a 102-vote win for Democrat Thomas Salmon after a recount.It has become increasingly uncommon to know the results of a presidential election on Election Day itself -- particularly on the East Coast. The extended counting process became more widespread following the contested 2000 presidential election, which took 36 days to resolve George W. Bush's victory in Florida through a Supreme Court ruling.In 2016, Trump wasn't declared the winner until 2:29 a.m. ET the day after Election Day. In 2020, Joe Biden's victory wasn't confirmed until the Saturday after Election Day, when he secured the necessary 270 electoral votes by winning Pennsylvania.This delay extends beyond presidential races. The large number of U.S. representatives from California -- where mail-in ballots can be counted for weeks after Election Day -- often prolongs the wait to determine which party will control the House of Representatives.As voting methods have changed, with more people opting for mail-in or early voting, waiting for final results has become the norm in U.S. elections, especially in close contests.",

    "content": "Vice President Kamala Harris will conduct her first-ever Fox News interview on Wednesday, which will be conducted by the network's chief political anchor, Bret Baier.The news of Harris's first sit-down interview with the network comes as the 2024 presidential election is in less than a month, with both candidates seeking to shore up their support ahead of Election Day. The interview will air on Fox News's Special Report with Bret Baier on Wednesday at 6 p.m. Eastern time, according to a news release from the network.Baier will conduct the interview in Pennsylvania, arguably the most sought-after state in the Electoral College.In recent weeks, both Harris and former President Donald Trump have conducted rallies and interviews, with Harris appearing on the Call Her Daddy podcast and doing a sit-down interview on 60 Minutes. Trump, meanwhile, has turned down the opportunity to do a 60 Minutes interview, instead doing interviews on The Hugh Hewitt Show and a number of other podcasts.On the same day of Harris's interview with Baier, Fox News will also air a town hall with Trump featuring a women-only audience, which will be moderated by network anchor Harris Faulkner. This town hall will be pretaped and air on Faulkner's show The Faulkner Focus at 11 a.m. ET.\nBoth Fox News and CNN have offered to host one more debate between the two presidential candidates, though the former president resoundingly rejected both offers, citing how early voting is already underway in a number of states. He also pointed to Harris's comment on The View talk show about how she would not have done anything differently over the last 3 1/2 years.Harris has argued that Trump's staff is the reason he will not do another debate, as his staff believes \"he's just not ready.\" Her attacks mirror the ones that Trump lobbed at President Joe Biden prior to suspending his reelection bid, which was preceded by concerns over Biden's mental fitness to continue serving as president.",

    "content": "Plan aims to protect crypto investors, faces criticism for narrow focus.Vice President Kamala Harris has unveiled a plan to support a cryptocurrency regulatory framework as part of her \"Opportunity Agenda for Black Men,\" signaling a potential shift in the Democratic approach to digital assets.What Happened: The proposal, released less than a month before the presidential election, acknowledges the growing importance of cryptocurrencies among Black Americans. According to Harris' team, over 20% of Black Americans currently own or have previously owned crypto assets.\"Vice President Harris appreciates the ways in which new technologies can broaden access to banking and financial services,\" the campaign stated in the plan.Harris' proposal aims to ensure that \"owners of and investors in digital assets benefit from a regulatory framework so that Black men and others who participate in this market are protected.\"This move aligns with Harris' broader economic vision, which she outlined in an 80-page plan last month. In that document, she expressed support for innovative technologies like AI and digital assets while emphasizing consumer and investor protection.It comes as polls between Harris and GOP candidate Donald Trump tighten and 66% of respondents in a CBS survey voice a pessimistic outlook for the country's direction.Read Also: Mark Cuban Questions Trump's Motive Behind WLFI Token Sale -- Former Prez Failed In The 'Bitcoin IQ Test,' Says Max KeiserWhy It Matters: The proposal has faced criticism from some industry leaders. Cleve Mesidor, founder of the National Policy Network of Women of Color in Blockchain, expressed concern about the narrow focus on Black men and the framing of their role in the crypto space.\"It is perplexing that the Harris-Walz policy team opted not to meet with diverse leaders in crypto, but instead is rolling out a policy that narrowly frames crypto around Black men only and proposes a regulatory framework limiting Black men to consumers instead of producers,\" Mesidor told The Block.As the election approaches, Harris' stance on crypto regulation could become a key differentiator in the race, especially given Trump's pledge to end what he calls an \"unlawful and un-American crackdown\" on the U.S. crypto industry.Harris' initiative comes at a crucial time as the 2024 presidential election looms. Her campaign has received significant support from the crypto community, including a $1 million donation in XRP from Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen.The election, featuring Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, presents a unique scenario for the cryptocurrency market. As Bitcoin remains stable despite the election's proximity, several analysts are predicting an imminent uptrend regardless of the outcome.Read Next:Mark Cuban To Replace Gary Gensler Under Harris Administration?

    "title": "'It's a Nail-Biter!' Nate Silver's Latest Poll Shows Harris with 51% Chance to Win, Donald Trump Grabs 275 Electoral Votes! - EconoTimes",
    "content": "Nate Silver's latest 2024 presidential election forecast paints a razor-thin race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. According to Silver's projections, Harris holds a slight edge with a 51% chance of winning, while Trump follows closely behind with a 49% chance, making it one of the closest election forecasts in recent history.Despite Harris' slight edge in the probability of winning, Trump leads in the projected electoral vote count, securing 275.5 votes to Harris' 262.5. The difference, though narrow, indicates that Trump could once again win the Electoral College while losing the popular vote -- an outcome reminiscent of his victory in 2016.The forecast, published on Silver's website, has sparked heated debates among political analysts and voters alike. Trump's lead in electoral votes suggests that he maintains strong support in key swing states that will ultimately decide the election. On the other hand, Harris' higher overall chances indicate that she could still win if the right combination of states swings in her favor.The forecast comes at a time when both candidates are gearing up for what is shaping up to be a highly contentious race. Trump, who remains a polarizing figure, has continued to rally his base with promises of economic reform and immigration crackdowns. Meanwhile, Harris has been working to solidify her position as the face of the Democratic Party, with a focus on social justice and economic equality.Nate Silver's model, which has a reputation for accurately predicting election outcomes, takes into account a wide range of factors, including polling data, historical trends, and voter demographics. Silver's latest projections indicate that while Trump has strong backing in states like Florida, Texas, and Ohio, Harris is performing well in key battleground states such as Pennsylvania and Michigan.Political analysts warn, however, that the race is far from over. With over a year until Election Day, voter sentiment can shift dramatically, particularly as debates, scandals, or new policy announcements unfold. Both campaigns are expected to pour significant resources into swing states, making every electoral vote critical.Trump's lead in the electoral count has sparked concerns among Democrats, many of whom remember the 2016 election, when Hillary Clinton won the popular vote but lost the presidency due to the Electoral College system. Harris' team is reportedly focusing on turning out voters in critical states, knowing that even a small shift could alter the election's trajectory.\"This is the closest we've seen,\" one analyst remarked, pointing to the razor-thin margins. \"It's a nail-biter, and both sides know it. The fight for every vote in swing states is going to be fierce.\"As the 2024 race continues to heat up, Silver's forecast serves as a reminder that the outcome is anything but certain. With just a small margin separating Harris and Trump, the next several months will be crucial in determining who will ultimately emerge victorious.",

    "title": "'Donald Trump Takes the Lead!' New Poll Shows Trump Surging Ahead of Kamala Harris in Crucial Battleground States - EconoTimes",
    "content": "A new general election poll conducted by HarrisX shows former President Donald Trump edging ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris in key battleground states. The poll, released on October 13, reveals that Trump holds 48% of voter support compared to Harris' 46%, a two-point lead that could have significant implications for the 2024 presidential election.The poll, which surveyed likely voters across critical battleground regions, highlights the narrow margin that separates the two contenders as the race intensifies. Trump's lead, though slim, signals his continued strength in states that will be crucial in determining the outcome of the next presidential election.The HarrisX poll shows that Trump has managed to gain momentum in these battlegrounds, solidifying his position among core Republican voters while making inroads with key independent groups. Despite ongoing legal challenges and controversies surrounding his previous administration, Trump's appeal to voters who prioritize issues such as the economy and immigration remains strong.This latest poll comes amid increased speculation about whether Vice President Harris will officially enter the race if President Joe Biden decides not to seek re-election. Harris has faced mixed approval ratings throughout her vice presidency, and this close polling result highlights the challenges she may face in a head-to-head contest against Trump.While Harris has made strides with key Democratic constituencies, including women and minority voters, her narrow gap with Trump in battleground states indicates a highly competitive race ahead. Democrats will need to rally significant support in these areas to close the gap and secure a victory.Political analysts note that these battleground states -- often including swing states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin -- have played a decisive role in previous elections, making them critical to the success of any candidate. In 2020, Biden managed to flip several of these states in his favor, but Trump's current lead suggests that the political landscape remains highly fluid.A two-point lead may not seem insurmountable for Harris, but it underscores the challenge she faces in uniting the Democratic base while appealing to swing voters in key regions. With the 2024 election still over a year away, both candidates will have ample time to court voters and shape their campaigns around the pressing issues of the day.As the poll results continue to reverberate, both Trump and Harris are likely to double down on their efforts to secure support in these crucial states. For Trump, this lead is a clear sign that his base remains energized and ready to back his return to the White House. For Harris, it's a signal that she must work to shore up her support among undecided voters and turn the tide in her favor.The race for the presidency is expected to remain competitive, and as this latest poll indicates, the path to victory will run through the battleground states once again.",

    "content": "Maronite Catholic priest recovering from injuries after attack at rectory in Philadelphia Home\"Local News\"What does the Catholic Church teach about lying? Local News What does the Catholic Church teach about lying? Catholic News Agency 2024-10-14 Catholic News Agency / October 14, 2024 / 0 0 Shares Facebook Twitter Pinterest WhatsAppBy Daniel PayneCNA Staff, Oct 12, 2024 / 06:00 amAs with any U.S. election season, the 2024 presidential election is filled with endless \"fact checks\" and accusations of falsehoods against various politicians. Separating lies from facts is ultimately up to the voter and lying may seem unimportant these days in the grand scheme of things, but what does the Catholic Church teach about it?Unsurprisingly, after 20 centuries, the Church has a lot to say about lying, one of the most common phenomena of the human experience.One of the Ten Commandments is \"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor\" and the Catechism of the Catholic Church states: \"Lying is to speak or act against the truth in order to lead someone into error\" (No. 2483).\"By injuring man's relation to truth and to his neighbor, a lie offends against the fundamental relation of man and of his word to the Lord,\" the catechism continues.The catechism notes in No. 2484 that a lie's severity \"is measured against the nature of the truth it deforms\" and that one must consider \"the circumstances, the intentions of the one who lies, and the harm suffered by its victims.\" A lie that constitutes a venial sin \"becomes mortal when it does grave injury to the virtues of justice and charity.\"Some of the Church's most towering thinkers have similarly condemned lying. St. Thomas Aquinas said lying was \"directly and formally opposed to the virtue of truth.\"St. Augustine, meanwhile, argued that \"whoever shall think there is any sort of lie that is not sin, will deceive himself foully, while he deems himself honest as a deceiver of other men.\"There seems to be little disagreement among moral authorities as to the wrongness of lying in general. But there has been some debate as to whether or not some types of falsehoods can be justified in certain circumstances, such as when telling some or all of the truth would bring about unjust harm against innocents.One fabled example concerns St. Athanasius, who legend has it was rowing away from his persecutors on a river. When he encountered a group of searchers who asked if he knew where Athanasius was located, he reportedly responded: \"He's not far away!\" after which he was able to flee.Other examples involve similarly extreme circumstances, such as if a murderous villain demands to know the location of an innocent person he intends to kill.Patrick Lee, a professor of philosophy at Franciscan University of Steubenville in Ohio, told CNA: \"My view is that St. Thomas and St. Augustine and the catechism are right, that all lying is wrong.\"He acknowledged that there are \"difficulties\" in that prohibition, such as the famous example of someone hiding Jewish refugees in their home and having to respond to Nazis searching for them.Still, \"the rules are really, really clear in Scripture,\" he argued. He cited Jesus' sharp words in John 8 in which Christ points out that Satan \"does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him,\" that in lying the devil \"speaks according to his own nature,\" and that he \"is a liar and the father of lies.\"\"It really does sound like you have an obligation to the truth,\" Lee said. Satan, he argued, \"is the source of lying -- all lying.\"Nevertheless, there have been attempts among Catholic thinkers over the years to justify some forms of lying or dishonesty. The Jesuits many years ago popularized the practice of \"mental reservation,\" a controversial philosophical principle that critics have argued is tantamount to lying.Jimmy Akin, a senior apologist at Catholic Answers, told CNA that when practicing mental reservation, \"one says something that is technically true but withholds or reserves part of the truth.\"\"On the basis of this partial disclosure of truth, the person to whom one is speaking may draw an incorrect conclusion, but one would not have said something technically false and thus not lied,\" he said.An example of mental reservation could be when an abusive husband demands to know where his wife is hiding. The woman's protector might respond, \"I have not seen your wife,\" while thinking to himself, \"...in the last 30 seconds.\"\"The concept of mental reservation has been criticized on the ground that many mental reservations involve telling a truth in a deliberately misleading way and thus involve deliberate deception, making them functionally equivalent to lying,\" Akin said.Akin noted that in recent years some Catholic moral theologians \"have been exploring other theories that seek to balance the importance of truth-telling with the seeming practical need to use deception in some circumstances.\"\"This may be in part a response to the totalitarian regimes that arose in the 20th century and the need to deceive them in order to protect human life,\" he said.The idea of using falsehoods to save innocent victims from violent aggressors received renewed attention several years ago when Pope Francis admitted that, as a young priest in Argentina, he participated in what it could be argued were false and duplicitous actions as part of efforts to work against the dictatorship there.Akin wrote in 2013 that the faithful should be \"cautious of drawing implications from this,\" in part because \"people can and do make mistakes.\" Additionally, at the time, Francis \"was not yet pope and did not have the responsibility and the graces of that office.\"He pointed out to CNA, however, that at one point the Catechism of the Catholic Church qualified its prohibition on lying: It previously held that \"to lie is to speak or act against the truth in order to lead into error someone who has the right to know the truth.\" The \"right-to-know\" proviso was removed in 1997.\"To my knowledge, the Holy See didn't comment on the reason for the change,\" Akin said, \"but it presumably was to avoid adopting one, specific, recent theory of lying when others were still legitimate also.\"The older directive \"seemed to support a theory in moral theology that would permit lying in cases where the person had no right to know the truth, such as in the famous example of lying to Nazis about the location of hidden Jewish individuals,\" Akin said.Lee said lying represents a fundamental betrayal of the person to whom you are telling the falsehood.\"You're inviting someone to trust you that what you're saying is in your mind,\" he said. \"So you, in a way, betray that trust. You ask them to believe you in the sense that what you're saying is what you think. You're presenting a false self and blocking community with them.\"Akin, meanwhile, pointed out that \"historically, the most prominent view has been the one supported by St. Thomas Aquinas.\"\"He held that lying is intrinsically wrong as a perversion of the human faculty of speech, which he saw as oriented toward communicating truthful information in a way that would preclude lying,\" Akin said.\"On his view, lying is never permissible, and so one could not lie to Nazis about hiding Jews in one's attic. One would have to do something else.\"\"Examples of things a non-exception-making Thomist might do include shutting the door in the Nazis' faces without saying anything or using a mental reservation of some kind,\" he said.\"The difficulty for the Thomist,\" Akin pointed out, \"is finding something that would be effective (if you shut the door, the Nazis may just kick it in and search the house) and that would not involve deliberate deception (as many mental reservations do).\"Tags:Daniel PayneTen Commandments Previous post Voting with our Faith Next post This is the most recent story.

It turned into a campaign promo for Donald Trump when Bill referenced the murder of nursing student Laken Riley. José Antonio Ibarra, a 26-year-old Venezuelan illegal alien, has been charged with her murder.\"You had a case in Georgia not very long ago. They made ad ad about a young woman who had been killed by an immigrant. Yeah, well, if they had all been properly vetted, that probably wouldn't have happened,\" Clinton told the audience.It doesn't take a political science expert to know that Bill is aiming that remark straight at Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.\"But if they are properly vetted and that doesn't happen - America's not having enough babies to keep our population up, so we need immigrants that have been vetted to do work - there wouldn't be a problem,\" Clinton continued.In the latest Gallup poll, voters still say the economy is the number one issue in the 2024 presidential election. 45% say that terrorism and national security are \"extremely important\" issues in the upcoming election. 41% say immigration is extremely important.Who do voters think would solve the immigration issue?Trump holds a nine-percentage point lead (54-45%) over Harris on this issue with voters.Meanwhile, you have former President Bill Clinton saying the same thing outloud with cameras rolling.

A survey conducted from October 4 to 8 by ABC in collaboration with Ipsos indicates that Harris is leading Trump by 2 percentage points.The 2024 US presidential election is scheduled for November 5. Initially, the Democratic Party was set to be represented by current President Joe Biden. However, after a poor performance in the June debate against Trump, pressure mounted within the Democratic ranks for Biden to step aside. On July 21, Biden announced his decision to withdraw from the race, endorsing Harris as the Democratic nominee. Her candidacy was subsequently ratified by delegates during the Democratic National Convention held in Chicago.As the election date draws near, both candidates face a tight race, with opinion polls and betting markets painting a picture of a highly competitive campaign.",

    "title": "Trump faces third assassination attempt in California - BLiTZ",
    "content": "In a events on October 12, law enforcement officers in Coachella, California, arrested a man outside a rally for former US President Donald Trump, foiling what authorities have described as a third assassination attempt on the life of the Republican frontrunner.The suspect, Vem Miller, a 49-year-old Las Vegas resident, was found in possession of a loaded handgun, a shotgun, and a high-capacity magazine, raising concerns about the safety of political figures in an increasingly polarized nation.The Riverside County Sheriff's Office revealed in a statement on October 13, that Miller had been apprehended at a checkpoint near the rally venue. Miller had attempted to pass through security by presenting fake VIP and press credentials, which immediately aroused suspicion. Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco emphasized that Miller's counterfeit press passes were unusual enough to prompt immediate action from law enforcement. \"We probably stopped another assassination attempt,\" Bianco told The Press-Enterprise, noting that Miller's possession of illegal firearms added weight to the alarming situation.Miller has been described by authorities as a \"sovereign citizen,\" a term used to identify individuals who belong to an anti-government movement that rejects the authority of federal, state, and local laws. These individuals often assert that they are not subject to government jurisdiction, leading them to ignore legal standards and regulations.Sheriff Bianco also revealed that Miller is a registered Republican with an educational background that includes a master's degree from the University of California, Los Angeles. In 2022, Miller ran unsuccessfully for the Nevada State Assembly. However, at this time, it remains unclear whether his political affiliation or extremist ideology motivated the apparent assassination attempt on Trump's life.Miller was subsequently released on $5,000 bail after being charged with illegal firearms possession. While authorities have refrained from explicitly stating that Miller intended to assassinate Trump, Sheriff Bianco has indicated that the circumstances suggest otherwise. Miller himself has neither confirmed nor denied any such intent. The investigation into the suspect's motives is ongoing, but Miller is scheduled to appear in court in January to face charges.This incident marks the third assassination attempt targeting Donald Trump in recent months, underscoring the unique dangers faced by the former president as he campaigns for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. In July, Trump narrowly avoided death at a rally in Pennsylvania when a sniper fired a shot that grazed his ear from a distance of 150 meters. Tragically, the shooter managed to kill one attendee and injure two others before being neutralized by Secret Service agents. The Pennsylvania incident sparked serious concerns about the preparedness and efficacy of Trump's security team, especially after it was revealed that the rooftop from which the gunman fired had been left unprotected by the Secret Service.A second attempt on Trump's life occurred in September at his West Palm Beach golf course in Florida. A gunman who had hidden behind a bush reportedly aimed at Trump but was spotted by Secret Service agents. The assailant fled the scene but was arrested shortly afterward. Authorities identified the suspect as Ryan Wesley Routh, an American citizen who had allegedly tried and failed to join the Ukrainian military in 2022. After his unsuccessful recruitment efforts, Routh reportedly devised a scheme to recruit former Afghan commandos to fight for Ukraine, raising questions about his political motivations and potential foreign ties.The persistent threats against Trump have prompted an outpouring of concern from his supporters and Republican officials, many of whom believe that foreign adversaries are actively plotting to assassinate the former president. US intelligence agencies have suggested that Iran, in particular, may be seeking to assassinate Trump as retaliation for the US killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike ordered by Trump in 2020. In response to these threats, President Joe Biden has taken the unusual step of warning Tehran that any attack on Trump would be treated as an act of war, signaling the gravity of the situation.Amidst the heightened security concerns surrounding Trump, Republican Representative Matt Gaetz recently claimed that multiple assassination teams are actively plotting to kill the former president. In a controversial interview with Breitbart News, Gaetz alleged that at least five assassination teams are currently operating within the US, with three of them reportedly linked to Iran, Pakistan, and Ukraine. While these claims have not been verified by law enforcement or intelligence agencies, they have fueled a growing narrative among some Republicans that Trump is being targeted by foreign actors intent on destabilizing the country.Adding to the swirling conspiracy theories, Gaetz also floated the possibility that a mole within the Secret Service could be leaking sensitive information to Trump's would-be assassins. This theory, though speculative, has gained traction among certain factions of Trump's base, who view the repeated assassination attempts as part of a broader conspiracy to eliminate Trump and undermine his political aspirations.The Secret Service has not commented directly on Gaetz's allegations but has reaffirmed its commitment to protecting Trump with the highest level of security possible. President Biden, despite his political rivalry with Trump, stated on Friday that he had ordered the Secret Service to afford Trump the same level of protection as if he were a sitting president. The Biden administration has reportedly granted Trump's campaign the freedom to request whatever security assistance they deem necessary.As Donald Trump continues his campaign for a second term in office, the escalating threats against his life raise serious questions about the safety of political leaders in the US The sharp increase in political violence and assassination attempts against high-profile figures has stirred fears of further unrest as the 2024 presidential election draws closer.For now, Trump remains undeterred by the risks, pressing forward with his rallies and public appearances. But with three assassination attempts already foiled, it is clear that the political climate in America has reached a dangerous tipping point, where the line between political dissent and violence is becoming increasingly blurred. The challenge for law enforcement and the Secret Service will be ensuring that political candidates-regardless of party-are protected from those who seek to silence them through violence.",

    "title": "Gabriel Sherman, Who Trump Calls a \"Lowlife and Talentless Hack,\" Opens Up About Writing 'The Apprentice'",
    "content": "Jake Paul Hits Back: How a Fallen YouTube Star Found Redemption in the RingDonald Trump has finally weighed in on The Apprentice, the indie biopic in cinemas this weekend that traces the rise of the future 45th president (played by Sebastian Stan) in the New York real estate world of the 1980s via the help of pitbull lawyer Roy Cohn (Jeremy Strong).Let's just say he isn't thrilled with it.\"A FAKE and CLASSLESS Movie written about me, called, The Apprentice (Do they even have the right to use that name without approval?), will hopefully 'bomb,'\" Trump posted Sunday night on Truth Social. \"It's a cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country, 'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!'\"Trump's broadside also referenced the film's depiction of his late, ex-wife Ivana (played by Maria Bakalova). In one shocking Apprentice scene, Trump rapes Ivana on the floor of their home. (The scene is based on a divorce deposition which Ivana later disavowed.)\"My former wife, Ivana, was a kind and wonderful person, and I had a great relationship with her until the day she died. The writer of this pile of garbage, Gabe Sherman, a lowlife and talentless hack, who has long been widely discredited, knew that, but chose to ignore it. So sad that HUMAN SCUM, like the people involved in this hopefully unsuccessful enterprise, are allowed to say and do whatever they want in order to hurt a Political Movement, which is far bigger than any of us. MAGA2024!\" he wrote.Trump's wishes for a \"hopefully unsuccessful enterprise\" may have come true, as The Apprentice, which faced a long and rocky road to distribution -- including a cease-and-desist attempt from Trump -- sputtered in its opening weekend at the box office. Released by Tom Ortenberg's Briarcliff Entertainment, the film earned $1.6 million from 1,740 screens, just barely cracking the top 10.Screenwriter Sherman, 45, spoke to The Hollywood Reporter just a few days before the film's release -- and before Trump's insults.You've done what many journalists have always dreamed of doing: You're a produced screenwriter.This movie has lived and died so many different lives that I didn't even believe it was going to get made until the first day of principal photography. Shortly before production, it looked like we weren't even going to meet payroll and the movie was going to fall apart. So I never took anything for granted with this movie.Was this your first stab at screenwriting?It was my first feature. When I came up with the idea for the film in the spring of 2017, I was adapting my Roger Ailes biography into a limited series at Showtime that starred Russell Crowe. So I was starting to work in television at the time, but really I had no experience writing a feature film. I was learning as I go.Did you report the screenplay?I did. I read everything I could about Donald Trump and Roy Cohn and New York City in the 1970s and '80s. And then I went out interviewing people who knew Donald and Roy during those years and asked them for more anecdotes. So it was a mix of historical research plus my own interviewsI guess I was first introduced to Roy Cohn through Angels in America. He's such a fascinating, complex, contradictory figure in American history. What's your take on him?Well, I kind of feel bad admitting this, but there was a huge gap in my cultural education in that I had not seen Angels in America or read the play prior to writing this screenplay. My knowledge of Roy Cohn was really through journalism and writing about Donald Trump and knowing the influence that Roy had on Trump. And the version of Roy that I wanted to write was a quieter, more contained version with more menace.What drives him? Is he evil?I think there's a deep nihilism at the core of Roy Cohn's personality. I think it can manifest as evil, but I don't think he is evil per se. I think he became evil because he hated himself so much. There's a humanity that is so deep inside Roy that it's hard to see, but I try to find it as a writer. I try to find the humanity even in the monsters. I find part of the reason our culture is so polarized as we stop trying to understand people that we might disagree with.Roy grew up at a time when it was impossible to be openly gay person and want to have a successful career. He had to destroy a side of himself that I think made him feel a nihilism. The world was so unfair that it could justify anything. And so I think he rationalized his behavior, which was a complete lack of morality, because he felt that the whole world is fucked. \"The world is fucked up. So it doesn't matter if I break the rules.\" I think that's a tragedy. I think there's a tragic element to Roy Cohn that I think the movie explores, and Jeremy Strong's performance is so brilliant.Both Cohn and Trump are two of the most vilified and loathed figures in American history. And yet I found myself being sympathetic to both of them in certain scenes. Were you worried at all that you were humanizing them too much?I can only write what feels true to me. So when I was writing the script, I was just writing these characters that felt true to the research that I had done. It's a love story. Roy loved Donald on multiple levels. There's a father-son dynamic to their relationship. I also think there's a homoerotic undercurrent to their relationship. One of the things I came across in my research was that a lot of Roy's boyfriends -- starting with Russell Eldridge, who's portrayed in the movie -- were blonde, blue-eyed, all-American-looking young men. I was struck by the similarities between them and young Donald Trump. I think Roy was in love with Trump. There's no evidence that he ever acted upon it.Let's talk about Apprentice director Ali Abbasi's interpretation. I saw someone compare this film to Scarface. There's definitely a kind of gonzo, over-the-top approach to the material. This is not a dry biopic.When I wrote the film, my inspiration wasn't biopics per se, but the classic movies of New York cinema. I wanted it to feel like a New York movie. Midnight Cowboy or Dog Day Afternoon, obviously The Godfather, The French Connection and Taxi Driver. I think Ali had this brilliant idea that he wanted the film to expose a system of corruption that was unique to American culture. One of his references was Barry Lyndon. He loves Kubrick, and he talked a lot about young Donald Trump being a character like Barry Lyndon. And the other thing we talked about was that this movie has a Boogie Nights energy to it.So the film premieres at Cannes and right away Trump's people start attacking and threatening lawsuits. What was that experience like?Trump's campaign sent us the cease and desist letter a day after the premiere. But they released a statement the night of the premiere saying, \"It's all lies, and we're going to sue.\" That's life imitating art. In the movie, Roy Cohn tells Trump that his number one lesson is to attack. So what do they do? They go on the attack. To my knowledge, no one had seen the film, and Trump himself to this day has not seen the movie, even though we've offered to screen it for him.And we've talked about Jeremy Strong, but we haven't spoken about Sebastian Stan, who I think does a really brilliant job of evoking him but not mimicking him. Who was in your mind when you were writing?I didn't have a specific actor in mind, per se, but I was disappointed because early in the casting, we did go out to some top actors who will remain nameless, who passed on the role. They all want to work with Ali. But some of them said, \"I can't play Trump. It's too risky.\" Or, \"I don't want to give my humanity to Trump, but Ali, I want to work with you on your next film.\" In 2019, Sebastian read the script and was immediately intrigued by the role. And he and I had dinner in New York and talked about it, and he was obviously nervous about playing Trump, but he did something that is a miracle.My fear was that this role would become just the two hour version of Saturday Night Live. And what Sebastian pulled off is, I can't even explain how he did it, but it's not an impersonation. As you said earlier, I felt like I was in the presence of Trump.",

    "title": "'We Need Donald Trump Back!' National Border Patrol Council Endorses Former President, Says Only He Can 'Secure Our Borders' - EconoTimes",
    "content": "The National Border Patrol Council (NBPC), the union representing nearly 18,000 Border Patrol agents, has officially endorsed former President Donald Trump for the 2024 presidential election. The announcement signals a major endorsement from a key law enforcement group that has been a staunch supporter of Trump's hardline immigration policies during his time in office.In a statement released on Wednesday, NBPC President Brandon Judd praised Trump for his unwavering support of Border Patrol agents and his dedication to securing the U.S.-Mexico border, calling him the only candidate capable of addressing the current border crisis. \"We need Trump back,\" Judd said. \"Under his leadership, we had the most secure border in our nation's history. It's time to return to that level of commitment to the safety and security of the American people.\"The endorsement, which comes as the 2024 presidential race heats up, highlights the continued support Trump enjoys among law enforcement groups, particularly those focused on immigration and border security. The NBPC previously endorsed Trump in both the 2016 and 2020 elections, citing his strong border enforcement policies, including the construction of a border wall and stricter immigration controls.The union's endorsement was not without controversy, as Trump's policies, such as family separations and detaining asylum seekers, have drawn criticism from human rights organizations and Democratic lawmakers. Nonetheless, NBPC leaders argue that Trump's measures were necessary to combat illegal immigration and protect American citizens.\"He's the only candidate who understands what's truly happening at our border,\" Judd continued. \"The situation is worse than ever, and we need a leader who is committed to fixing it. President Trump did it once, and we know he can do it again.\"The endorsement comes as the U.S. continues to grapple with a surge in migrants at the southern border. Critics of the current administration, including Trump, have blamed President Joe Biden for what they describe as a \"border crisis,\" citing record numbers of illegal crossings and overwhelming strain on Border Patrol resources. The NBPC's support for Trump underscores the belief among many agents that his policies were effective in reducing illegal immigration.Trump responded to the endorsement with a statement thanking the NBPC for their continued support. \"I am honored to have the endorsement of the National Border Patrol Council once again,\" he said. \"Our brave Border Patrol agents are the frontline defenders of our nation, and they know that under my leadership, America had the strongest, safest border policies. Together, we will restore law and order at our borders and keep our country safe.\"While Trump remains a polarizing figure in American politics, his appeal to law enforcement and conservative voters remains strong, particularly on issues of immigration and border security. His endorsement from the NBPC could boost his campaign as he seeks to regain the presidency in 2024.As the race moves forward, border security is expected to be a central issue in the campaign, with Trump positioning himself as the candidate most capable of handling the ongoing challenges at the southern border.The NBPC's endorsement is likely to further energize Trump's base of supporters, particularly those who view immigration and border control as critical issues in the upcoming election. Whether it will sway undecided voters or change the course of the race remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Trump has the backing of those on the front lines of border enforcement.",

    "content": "You can opt-out at any time by visiting our Preferences page or by clicking \"unsubscribe\" at the bottom of the email.Director Ali Abbasi's \"The Apprentice\" presents a dramatized origin story for Donald Trump (played by Sebastian Stan), who, in the span of a few decades, goes from a nobody to a New York real-estate tycoon under the guidance of his lawyer, Roy Cohn (Jeremy Strong).Though the movie doesn't delve into Trump's political aspirations -- it ends right when author Tony Schwartz begins to discuss ghostwriting the 1987 book \"The Art of the Deal\" with Trump -- we see how the main lessons from Cohn would be Trump's guiding principles through his career and into his presidency, including attack, attack, attack; deny everything, admit nothing; and always claim victory.That \"always claim victory\" rule came into play during the 2020 presidential election. After his loss, Trump maintained that the election was stolen from him and that he'd actually won over Joe Biden.Soon after, Pro-Trump insurrectionists attacked the US Capitol in an attempted coup on January 6, 2021, that left four dead. Trump has denied responsibility for the January 6 insurrection and publicly condemned it as a \"heinous attack\" that left him \"outraged by the violence, lawlessness, and mayhem.\"The 2024 presidential election, in which Trump seeks to reclaim the presidency against Vice President Kamala Harris, is now less than a month away.The question of whether Trump will accept the results of this election remains unclear. In May, Trump said he'd accept the results if \"everything's honest.\" A month later, at the first debate with President Joe Biden, he was unwilling to say if he would accept the results or not. In August, he told CBS News he would accept the results if they were \"fair and free.\"In a recent interview promoting \"The Apprentice,\" Abbasi, who has been studying Trump since he signed on to make the film in 2018, weighed in on whether he believes Trump will accept the results in the event of a loss.\"I saw, like everyone else, what happened on January 6, which was horrific,\" he told Business Insider. \"And I have a feeling that a lot of people got away with insane stuff. Look at that footage.\"\"When you see that, you think, why would they change their opinion about this election? Why would they magically accept this when they didn't accept that?\" Abbasi continued.\"But somehow, I'm an optimist,\" he added. \"I was optimistic when people told me not to do this movie, or when people said no one would buy this movie. So, I really hope that everyone learned their lesson on January 6th. I hope to think that even though people may be tempted to do that again, they know what the consequences are, and they don't do it.\"In August 2023, Trump was indicted on four charges in connection to January 6, including conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction or an attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights. A year later, the four counts were revised to remove some of the alleged conduct that may now be protected by presidential immunity. Trump has pleaded not guilty.After interviewing Abbasi, Business Insider reached out to Trump for comment. A spokesperson for the former president slammed the movie.\"This 'film' is pure malicious defamation, should never see the light of day, and doesn't even deserve a place in the straight-to-DVD section of a bargain bin at a soon-to-be-closed discount movie store,\" Trump communications director Steven Cheung said in a statement. \"It belongs in a dumpster fire.\"",

There was no aspirational pieces...and Sali gets all these amazing people together and we all get to hang out.\"Guests mingled over sparkling wine, tuna tartare and caviar appetizers before sitting down for a dinner of Dover sole in the historic building built in 1928 by Charlie Chaplin, before it turned into a restaurant.\"Thank you for allowing us to feature you over the years,\" Christeson told the crowd during her toast, referring to the brand's editorials featuring prominent women. \"The goal for tonight is to connect women who wouldn't connect otherwise...and hope something magical comes from that.\"Argent's speciality pants suits were the uniform for the evening, seen on Oakland retailer Sherri McMullen, fashion consultant Laura Brown, former First Lady Michelle Obama's stylist Meredith Koop and more.Several women wore hot pink suits in a nod to Argent's #VotingSuitsYou campaign, which kicked off Oct. 1 to mobilize voter awareness for the 2024 presidential election in partnership with Obama's nonpartisan voting organization When We All Vote, which was a topic at dinner.\"We want to change the culture around voting, and one of the ways we do that is through partnerships like this....We're 25 days away from the election and we have work to do. You all have platforms to remind to register and get out the vote,\" said Beth Lynk, When We All Vote's executive director, in a pink suit herself. \"We're hosting parties in polling locations, and just like tonight we know there is an opportunity when we come together as community for action...to support women, lift up women and ultimately vote for women in this election.\"",

    "content": "With battleground state 2024 polls showing an extremely close race, both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are looking for the edge that will help them over the finish line first on Election Day.After winning the endorsement and support of former third-party candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump is poised to add a majority of his backers, according to a new survey provided to Secrets.The groups that polled for and backed Kennedy, American Values '24 and John Zogby Strategies, released a survey that said Trump holds a 22-point lead over Harris among Kennedy's supporters.In five of the six battleground states, Kennedy supporters prefer Trump over Harris by 20 points to 39 points.\"This means that the Kennedy Cohort will play a decisive factor in determining the eventual winner of the 2024 presidential election,\" said a Kennedy associate.In August, Kennedy dropped out of the presidential race and said he had no clear path to victory. At the time, some 7% of voters supported his campaign, according to the Pew Research Center.He then endorsed Trump's candidacy and has indicated he would accept a key position in a second Trump administration.In choosing to back Trump, Kennedy rejected his family's Democratic Party legacy after they spent much of the campaign criticizing him as a gadfly and spoiler. Liberals also mocked Kennedy's questioning of COVID-19 policies.\"This comprehensive poll shows RFK Jr. continues to play a major role in our political landscape after suspending his one-and-a-half-year tenure in the thick of the political arena,\" said Jeremy Zogby, managing partner of John Zogby Strategies.\"Democrat-leaning journalists have asked me how they could pick up a critical mass of his support. I tell them they should start by taking Kennedy more seriously. The DNC may have made a big mistake by not taking him more seriously,\" he told Secrets.In the new John Zogby Strategies survey, 56% of Kennedy's supporters backed Trump, while Harris won 34%. A third of Kennedy's backers were \"not yet voting for Trump\" but would be \"open\" to supporting him.While this might not have a big impact nationally, it does in the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.SEE THE LATEST POLITICAL NEWS AND BUZZ FROM WASHINGTON SECRETSAV24 and John Zogby Strategies provided Secrets with a graphic showing that \"bump\" of support:",

    "title": "Harris-Trump polls tighten, but PredictIt and Polymarket tell a different story",
    "content": "But prediction markets tell a different story. PredictIt shows Trump's campaign in the lead as the 2024 presidential election winner. It also has the GOP winning the presidency and the electoral college margin. As of Monday afternoon, Polymarket, a cryptocurrency-based prediction marketplace, also shows Trump has a better chance of winning the election on Nov. 5.While prediction markets have been around for a while, they've grown in popularity -- especially for political events. These betting sites allow traders to buy and sell shares on the outcome of a given event, like whether Trump will get impeached or Biden will leave the presidential race.Traders then buy shares depending on which outcome they think is more likely. Share prices or \"odds\" rise and fall depending on demand. If the event happens the way the trader predicted, the contract or \"bet\" will rise to $1 and pay out -- or fall to $0 if it does not.Prediction markets can be a more sophisticated and accurate way to foresee political events, Thomas Miller, a data scientist at Northwestern University, told Fortune's Shawn Tully. Miller is renowned for his accurate predictions during the 2020 election, and much of his methodology comes from examining prediction markets.\"Political betting sites are the best at predicting the wisdom of the crowd,\" he told Fortune.While polls tell you about how people responded in the recent past, the odds on sites like PredictIt and Polymarket show real-time sentiment and are better for mapping the future, according to Miller. Plus, polls don't show who will win the electoral college, while traders on prediction markets can wager on its outcome.Three national polls released Sunday show Harris's lead is slimming.Last month, an ABC/Ipsos poll of likely voters showed Harris with a six-point lead over Trump. But that gap has closed to 50% support for Harris to 48% for Trump. A CBS/YouGov poll shows Harris up 51% to 48%, down from a four-point lead last month. And NBC's poll of registered voters shows a complete tie between Harris and Trump, both at 48%.\"As summer has turned to fall, any signs of momentum for Kamala Harris have stopped,\" Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff, told NBC. \"The race is a dead heat.\"Meanwhile, Polymarket shows Trump has a 54% chance of winning the presidential election with Harris trailing behind at just a 45.3% chance.PredictIt's markets are a little closer. For the market called \"Who will win the 2024 US presidential election?\" the \"yes\" outcome for Trump is currently at $0.54 and the \"yes\" outcome for Harris is $0.50.\"If you wanted a single best predictor, one source of information to know what's going on in the elections, it's the prediction market,\" Harry Crane, a statistics professor at Rutgers University, told CNN. \"Any given piece of information that you might have, such as a poll or an aggregator, or news, or a pundit's opinion, all of that is being combined in the participant's markets who have an incentive to get it right and to make money off of it.\"But if prediction markets are as accurate as some experts say, why would there be such a discrepancy with what polls are showing? It comes down to what each is measuring, Ryan Waite, vice president of public affairs at public affairs consultancy Think Big, told Fortune.\"Polls tell us how voters feel right now, while prediction markets attempt to predict what will happen in the future,\" he said. \"Prediction markets are quicker to respond to new information, such as economic shifts or debate performances, while polls take time to update.\"But prediction markets aren't perfect, Waite said, explaining that they can be manipulated by someone with a lot of money who wants to sway perception and that they aren't always accessible to everyone.Still, polls have issues of their own, including sampling bias, leading questioning, and non-responses that can also produce inaccuracies. That's why -- at least for now -- using both polls and prediction markets can help us understand future political events.\"While prediction markets are gaining traction, they're not going to replace traditional polling anytime soon,\" Waite said. \"They provide a complementary perspective. Polls help us understand how different voter segments feel about candidates or issues, while prediction markets can provide a dynamic view of how the broader public thinks things will play out. Together, they give a fuller picture of the political landscape.\"",

    "title": "Presidents of the United States: Millard Fillmore, leader of the Compromise",
    "content": "Editor's Note: This profile is part of a series taking a closer look at US presidents ahead of the 2024 presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.Millard Fillmore, the 13th president of the United States, is often remembered as a transitional figure in the turbulent years leading up to the American Civil War.His presidency is most notable for the Compromise of 1850, which sought to ease tensions between free and slave states. Though Fillmore's efforts temporarily averted conflict, his administration's policies on slavery and sectionalism left a complicated legacy.Fillmore's rise in politicsMillard Fillmore was born on January 7, 1800, in a log cabin in Moravia, New York, to Nathaniel and Phoebe Fillmore. The second of nine children, Fillmore grew up in a poor farming family and had little formal education.However, he was determined to rise above his humble beginnings, and through self-study, he became a teacher and later an apprentice to a lawyer. By 1823, Fillmore was admitted to the New York State Bar, and he began practising law in East Aurora, New York.Fillmore entered politics in the late 1820s as a member of the Anti-Masonic Party, an early third party in American politics. In 1832, he was elected to the New York State Assembly, where he gained a reputation as a moderate and pragmatic legislator.By the mid-1830s, Fillmore had aligned himself with the Whig Party, which opposed the policies of US President Andrew Jackson.Fillmore in the spotlightFillmore was elected to the US House of Representatives in 1833, where he served for eight years. During his time in Congress, he became an advocate for economic modernisation, supporting tariffs to protect American industry and federal funding for infrastructure projects such as roads and canals.He also played a significant role in the creation of the US Treasury Department, co-authoring legislation that established the department in 1841.After leaving Congress, Fillmore served as New York's comptroller, where he worked to reform the state's financial system. His success in this role boosted his standing within the Whig Party, and in 1848, he was chosen as the vice-presidential candidate on a ticket with General Zachary Taylor.The Compromise of 1850 and sectional tensionsFillmore became president on July 9, 1850, following the death of US President Zachary Taylor, who had served just 16 months in office. As president, Fillmore inherited the nation's growing divide over the issue of slavery, particularly in the newly acquired territories from the Mexican-American War.One of Fillmore's most consequential acts as president was his support for the Compromise of 1850, a package of five laws aimed at resolving the status of slavery in the territories.The compromise included the admission of California as a free state, the establishment of territorial governments in New Mexico and Utah without restrictions on slavery, and the abolition of the slave trade in Washington DC.It also included the controversial Fugitive Slave Act, which required that escaped enslaved people be returned to their owners, even if they had reached free states.While the Compromise of 1850 temporarily calmed sectional tensions, the Fugitive Slave Act sparked widespread outrage in the North, where abolitionists viewed it as a betrayal of their values.Fillmore's enforcement of the law alienated many Northern Whigs, contributing to the eventual collapse of the party.Fillmore opens relations with JapanFillmore's presidency also saw several notable foreign policy initiatives. He opened relations with Japan, dispatching Commodore Matthew Perry on a mission to establish trade with the isolationist nation.Perry's mission ultimately resulted in the Treaty of Kanagawa in 1854, which marked the beginning of formal relations between the US and Japan.Domestically, Fillmore supported internal improvements, including expanding the nation's railroad system and improving harbours and waterways. He also presided over the admission of California as a state and the expansion of territories in the American West.Post-presidency FillmoreFillmore's decision to support the Compromise of 1850, particularly the Fugitive Slave Act, made him unpopular with many in the North, and he failed to secure the Whig Party's nomination for the 1852 election. After leaving the presidency in 1853, Fillmore retired to Buffalo, New York.In 1856, Fillmore returned to the national stage as the presidential candidate for the American Party, also known as the \"Know-Nothing\" Party, which was focused on nativist and anti-immigrant policies.He finished third in the election, behind Democrat James Buchanan and Republican John C Frémont.Fillmore largely retired from public life after his defeat in 1856. He continued to serve his community in Buffalo, engaging in charitable and educational activities, and was involved in the founding of the University at Buffalo.Millard Fillmore's legacyMillard Fillmore's presidency is often viewed as one of compromise and moderation during a period of increasing sectional tension.His support for the Compromise of 1850, particularly the Fugitive Slave Act, has been criticised for enabling the expansion of slavery and deepening the divide between North and South.While his foreign policy initiatives, such as opening relations with Japan, are seen as successful, Fillmore is generally regarded as a president who struggled to navigate the complex and divisive issues of his time.He remains a somewhat overlooked figure in American history, often overshadowed by the more prominent leaders who followed him in the lead-up to the Civil War.",

As thousands of counties and towns report vote totals, it can be hard to figure out when the results reported so far will reflect the outcome. Past elections can provide a guide.Want to follow election results like a pro? Here's what to watch in key statesThe Constitution sets out broad principles for electing a national government and leaves the details to the states. The choices made by state lawmakers and election officials as they sort out those details affect everything from how voters cast a ballot, how quickly the tabulation and release of results takes place, how elections are kept secure and how officials maintain voters' confidence in the process.Florida has nearly all ballots counted on Election Day, while California can take weeks. This is whyIt may be no surprise that people seek certainty before elections happen, given what they see as the stakes: One recent poll found that about 7 in 10 Americans believe that the future of democracy is at stake in this year's presidential election. Yet often the forecasters themselves are the first to push back on the characterization that they can tell you what's going to happen.How elections forecasters became political 'prophets'If you want to cast a ballot on Election Day or vote by mail, it helps to know the rules.Who can vote in US elections, and what steps must you take to do so?Voting before Election Day is much more common today than it was roughly 50 years ago. Yet it is highly politicized as voting in the 2024 presidential election is already underway.How voting before Election Day became so widespread and so politicalIn a closely contested presidential election, as many expect 2024 to be, the results in a few bellwether counties in the key battleground states are likely to decide the outcome, just as they did in the past two general elections. Here's a look at those that might matter the most on Election Day:Where are the voters who could decide the presidential election?The U.S. general election on Nov. 5 will decide the country's direction, but it is far from a nationally administered contest. The 50 states and the District of Columbia run their own elections, and each does things a little differently.Not all elections look the same. Here are some of the different ways states run their votingAn uncommon system of voting could be central to which party controls the U.S. House this fall -- or even the presidency. In Maine and Alaska, voters in competitive congressional districts will elect a winner using ranked choice voting. Here's how it works:Ranked choice voting could decide which party controls the US House. How does it work?Voter fraud does happen occasionally. When it does, we tend to hear a lot about it. It also gets caught and prosecuted. The nation's multilayered election processes provide many safeguards that keep voter fraud generally detectable and rare, according to current and former election administrators of both parties.Yes, voter fraud happens. But it's rare and election offices have safeguards to catch itElection officials rely on various pieces of technology. Every office does things a little bit differently. In November's presidential election, nearly every ballot cast will have a paper record that can be used to obtain an accurate count even if there are errors or cyberattacks.Voting systems have been under attack since 2020, but are tested regularly for accuracy and securityControversies over hand counting have flared periodically in pockets of the country before the 2024 presidential election, even though research has shown that it is more prone to error, costlier and likely to delay results.Election conspiracy theories fueled a push to hand-count votes, but doing so is risky and slowFeeds and live videos streaming from election sites across the country are an effort by election officials to demystify voting and provide greater transparency to a process that in recent years has been subject to intense scrutiny, misinformation and false claims of widespread fraud.On a screen near you: Officials are livestreaming the election process for more transparencyAmerica's court system has no formal role in the election process, and judges generally try not to get involved because they don't want to be seen as interfering or shaping a partisan outcome, said Paul Schiff Berman, a professor at George Washington University Law School. But election disputes have increasingly landed in court since Bush v. Gore, Berman said.Courts could see wave of election lawsuits, but experts say bar to change outcome is highThe presidential race is competitive. That's about as much as the national polls can tell us right now, even if it looks like Democrat Kamala Harris is down in one poll or Republican Donald Trump is up in another.Will the polls be right in 2024? What polling on the presidential race can and can't tell youChances are, you have never been contacted for an election poll. But the dozens of high-quality election polls that will be released before Election Day represent a reasonable estimate of the opinions of all Americans.How a poll can represent your opinion even if you weren't contacted for itThe Electoral College is the unique American system of electing presidents. It is different from the popular vote, and it has an outsize impact on how candidates run and win campaigns.What is the Electoral College and how does the US use it to elect presidents?It's election night, the polls have closed and chances are you're waiting on one of the major television networks to say who will be the next president. But why does the news media play that role in the first place? Shouldn't that be the government's job? Here's a brief history:News media don't run elections. Why do they call the winners?For the outcome of this year's presidential race, it will be the vote count on election night and possibly in the days after that will grab the public's attention. But those numbers are unofficial until the election is formally certified -- a once uneventful process that has become politicized since then-President Trump tried to overturn his reelection loss four years ago.Election certification is a traditionally routine duty that has become politicized in the Trump eraWith the American electorate so evenly divided, there will be elections in November close enough that officials will have to recount the votes. Just don't expect those recounts to change the winner. They rarely do, even when the margins are tiny.",

    "content": "With only 22 days remaining until the 2024 Presidential Election, The View co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin urged the Harris campaign to \"ratchet up the fear factor.\"\"I think they need to better utilize surrogates,\" Griffin said during Monday's episode. \"For example, if we consider the young white male voters Trump is targeting, they should have Josh Shapiro appear on Joe Rogan, or have billionaire Jamie Pritzker engage with the Barstool Sports crowd to discuss why their vision is more aspirational. They need to leave nothing on the table in this final stretch.\"A new national poll released Sunday by NBC News showed Trump in a \"dead heat\" with Harris, with the two candidates tied, each with 48 percent support among registered voters. Notably, that's a 4-point boost for Trump compared to NBC News' September poll, and a 1-point decline for Harris.Sunny Hostin disagrees, asserting Harris has run a 'flawless' campaign, having raised a billion dollars. She believes the press shares some of the blame, pointing out CNN reports Democrats are feeling anxious, Axios highlights the \"blue wall blues,\" and FOX claims they are \"scared to death.\"\"Dems are not scared to death, Dems are pumped,\" Hostin said. \"What I would like the press to talk a little bit more about is Trump is in hiding. He didn't do the 60 Minutes interview. He does not want to do another debate. He's in mental decline.\"Co-host Sarah Haines said Harris doesn't have a flawless campaign, as many people still struggle to distinguish her from the Biden administration. She also acknowledged missing several opportunities during her media blitz to set herself apart.\"They know why she's not Donald Trump, but they don't know why she's not President Biden,\" Haines said. \"And I think she needs to be both of those things in an election of change.\"Haines said during her press tour she didn't have to throw Biden under the bus; she could have said, \"I was his wingman. I loved it. We were successful. We did a lot of great things. But now that I'm the boss, these are the things I would love.\"Hostin said Harris indicated she would have a Republican in her cabinet if she had the chance to do things differently. However, when originally asked, \"If anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?\" Kamala responded, \"Not a thing comes to mind.\"Griffin said Republicans are ahead of Democrats in registering new voters in crucial battleground states, which could be pivotal. She also highlighted the importance of change, stating the public is shifting against Biden's policies, regardless of personal opinions about him.Hostin fired back stating, statistically, the Biden administration has been one of the most effective in recent history.The group also discussed Trump's refusal to release his medical information, calling out Republicans as hypocrites for demanding the same from Biden just a few months ago.Hostin said all we're receiving is a comprehensive report from seven years ago.\"He had high cholesterol. That concerns me,\" Hostin said. \"He was overweight, obviously, and he had rosacea. I don't know if I care about that as much, but that's the most information that we have about the man that wants to be next to the nuclear codes.\"She also said Trump's erratic speaking style suggests dementia or cognitive decline, as he often rambles and jumps from topic to topic. However, he refers to this style as \"weaving.\"Ana Navarro chimed in with a joke, suggesting Trump's bronzer color is also a sign of dementia, saying, \"If he gets any darker, he's gonna have to deport himself.\"",

    "title": "LETTERS TO THE EDITOR: Too difficult to call outcome of crucial US election | The Southern Star",
    "content": "EDITOR - The 2024 US presidential election is the most crucial in years. We learned in 2016 that polls are not a guaranteed indicator when Donald Trump was a shock winner. He didn't expect to win and had no proper transition team ready.Past US presidential election wins were more predictable, but some of them had seriously underhand dealings. Watergate is one of two examples when a few of the Republican and Democrat party members succumbed to unethical behaviour.The first example is the Watergate break-in into the Democrat Party's office in the Watergate apartment complex in Washington DC to steal their election plans for the US election in 1972.The burglars were caught on the spot by security guards and it led to Republican US president Richard Nixon having to resign two years later, because of his attempted cover-up of the break-in. The 50th anniversary of his resignation was this year.The break-in was unnecessary as Nixon won his second term in 1972 by a landslide and already had huge support from the American voters. His insecurity as to whether he would win was a factor in the break-in. He previously lost the 1960 US election to JFK by a narrow margin.The men who were caught trying to break in to the Watergate complex were found guilty. President Nixon resigned or he would have been impeached and forced to resign. His successor, vice-president Gerald Ford was not involved in any way in the break-in. He pardoned him to bring it to a dignified end.The second example is when a decade before, the Democrats broke into the Republican Party election offices before the 1964 US presidential election. Their operatives stole election plans of the Republican candidate, Barry Goldwater.The difference between the two break-ins is their burglars were not caught.Another unnecessary break-in. Barry Goldwater did not have national support. President Lyndon Johnson was sure to win. He did by a landslide with sympathy from voters for the Democrat Party after the assassination and loss to the country of his predecessor JFK, the previous year.Johnson had similar insecurities to Nixon about popularity. This time, few can predict the outcome of the US presidential election on November 5th.EDITOR - The situation here in Lebanon is extremely concerning and getting worse each day. Frightening and sleepless nights due to frequent bombing is the new normal for everyone, including us humanitarian workers.It is truly terrifying to live in a city where anywhere can be attacked at any time. The country is witnessing its largest displacement crisis in history due to the ongoing conflict with over 1.2m people seeking refuge from the conflict.The impact of the ongoing hostilities on displaced populations has been immense. Many have lost their homes and loved ones. They are exhausted. People hitchhike for days to try to reach safer locations elsewhere in the country.Hundreds of thousands of people are now camping and sleeping outside in the streets or in parks and on beaches. People are in urgent need of shelters and also basic items like blankets, mattresses, pillows and soap.More and more people are arriving each day after fleeing their homes. Many people are sleeping on floors with no mattresses. Vulnerable groups such as pregnant women and newborn children require specialised support.Concern are on the ground receiving and supporting as many families as we can, but there are huge gaps in the availability of critical services to respond to the ever-increasing overcrowding. The lack of resources will only get worse too as the conflict is further exacerbated.I would like to call upon the Irish community who are known for their compassion and generosity to come forward in this hour of extreme hardship and support our appeal to help the families, children, elderly and everyone displaced in this crisis.EDITOR - There has been no action on the road - no action whatsoever on the problem with the school buses so the children can get to school.What does it take for the government to be involved in what they are supposed to? They are perfectly able to build an exorbitantly-priced bicycle stand and they can ignore the disaster of a children's hospital price. I'm afraid to ask, what have I missed?Since I have lived here there have been constant repairs, in spots, on the N71.Skibbereen was tantalised with a scheme to improve the centre of town. That was a year ago. Perhaps the new footpath on Bridge Street is part of that. But oh please, we need paint! Actually, I would applaud anything that would involve something for our teenagers. A cinema, a bowling area, a swimming pool. What will happen when all the kids move away? Then where is the town going? Wrong word, as it is definitely not going anywhere. Here we are, an Olympic gold medal town ... can we not stand up and be counted?Wouldn't it be something if people said 'wow' when they visited?What a show of appreciation if we saw people taking pictures because they want to remember our town. For those of us who live here, it's the people that make the town, but if we want revenue and support for businesses, we need the visitors.And we need the visitors to talk about us because they are impressed with what they have seen.EDITOR - I was gobsmacked - to put it mildly - to hear last week that the Cork Business Association is going to pay shop owners to keep their lights on - for security reasons - in Cork city. I had to read it twice to be sure it wasn't a mistake - and then check the date that it wasn't April 1st.Are we really saying, at at time when every emphasis around us is on keeping energy consumption down, that money will be used to fund this hair-brained scheme?If so, this money is being used to shore up the gaps left by a shortage of gardaí. If we had more gardaí patrolling the streets we wouldn't need a 'Leave a Light On' initiative.We'll be a laughing stock with this kind of backwards attitude to energy - as the decent people of Ireland strive, every day, to save the planet.",

    "title": "How democratic is the US really?",
    "content": "When Americans elect their next president in November, the candidate with the most votes might not be the winner. Democracy in the US comes with some quirks -- and was under attack not so long ago. How is it faring today?For a long time, the US viewed itself as an exemplary democracy: a country other nations could look to when building their own democracies after gaining independence or shedding authoritarian regimes.That idea is manifested in the \"city upon a hill\" metaphor. Politicians from John F. Kennedy to Barack Obama have referred to the United States as a glowing beacon, drawing everyone's eyes. In 1961, President-elect Kennedy said the world was still looking to the US and its democracy and that \"our governments, in every branch, at every level, national, state and local, must be as a city upon a hill.\"On January 6, 2021, the world's eyes were on the United States. That day, a mob of right-wing extremists, encouraged by then President Donald Trump, stormed the US Capitol in an attempt to interrupt the democratic transfer of power after the 2020 election.And, in a 2023 poll by the Associated Press news agency in cooperation with the University of Chicago, only 10% of participants said that democracy in the United States was working extremely or very well.So what is the state of US democracy today, ahead of the 2024 presidential election?\"I think it's fair to say Americans don't have a lot of trust right now in governmental institutions,\" Michael Berkman, director of the McCourtney Institute for Democracy and a political science professor at Pennsylvania State University told DW. \"They're looking at a Congress that is not functioning well at all and they're looking at some rather intractable problems that government has not really addressed, like gun violence and climate change.\"With their inability to choose a leader, the Republican majority in the House of Representatives paralyzed Congress for weeks in October 2023. But even without interruptions like this, getting any laws through both chambers of Congress -- the House and the Senate -- is slow going because of the deeply entrenched partisanship between Republicans and Democrats.\"It is extremely difficult, sometimes impossible, to pass legislation even when overwhelming majorities of the public support a measure,\" Vanessa Williamson, a senior fellow in governance studies at US think tank the Brookings Institution, told DW. \"There is very serious dysfunction in Washington.\"The harsh polarization, the gulf between Democratic and Republican supporters, means that at least half the country is likely to be extremely unhappy with many decisions the elected government is making.After the 2020 elections, many Republicans (lead by Trump) were so unhappy with the election results that they tried to ignore them, falsely claiming the election was \"stolen\" from them so vehemently that eventually, a mob of those who believed it stormed the Capitol. A peaceful transition of power is one of the hallmarks of democracy, and that almost didn't happen in the US.\"I think what happened on January 6 and the refusal of one side to accept the results of the election is very damaging for a democracy, since accepting the outcome of an election is pretty much central to democratic politics,\" Berkman said.It is not surprising then that trust in democratic institutions has gone down in recent years. But there's more you might not expect from a country like the US.\"In addition to the recent forms of democratic erosion, the United States has many anti-democratic practices of very long standing,\" Williamson said.Chief among them: The winner of the presidential election is not necessarily the one with the most votes.Most recently, Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election even though his opponent, Hillary Clinton, garnered roughly 2.9 million more votes than him. The reason behind this conundrum is the electoral college. In the US, each of the 50 states has a certain number of electors depending on its population size. The candidate who wins the majority of the people's votes in a state is the one who gets the state's electoral votes. Sounds complicated? Here's an example.California as the most populous state has the most electors in the electoral college: 54. The candidate who can get the most Californians to vote for them will receive all 54 of these elector votes, even if they only won the popular vote in California by a narrow margin. Smaller states like Vermont or South Dakota only have three electoral college votes, but the system is the same.To win the presidency, a candidate must win in enough states to bring his electoral college vote up to 270 electors or more. Someone who wins states by small margins can thus become president, even though more Americans in total voted for the other candidate.Another part of the US political system that does not reflect a perfect democracy is the upper chamber of Congress: The US Senate. Each US state has two senators in the chamber -- no matter the state's population size.That means in some states, one senator represents a few hundred thousand people, while in another, a couple of million people \"share\" a senator. When the Senate has a decision to make, each senator's vote holds exactly the same weight, even though they represent vastly different numbers of people.Berkman calls the Senate \"a deeply undemocratic institution.\" And Williamson says that as a result of the way the Senate is set up, \"our most populous regions are profoundly underrepresented in the legislative process.\"The US might not be a model democracy, but Americans haven't given up on it. More people are getting involved.The voter turnout in the 2020 presidential election stood at more than 65%, higher than it had been in more than 100 years.\"You see increased political participation over the last eight, 10 years,\" Berkman said. \"And I think that's important.\"",

The film opened over the weekend courtesy of Briarcliff Entertainment, and Trump is making it very clear that he has no nice feelings about the movie.Trump took to his Truth Social page and went in hard against The Apprentice, calling it \"A FAKE and CLASSLESS\" movie and suggesting the film was being released before the 2024 Presidential Election to \"hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country.\" Much of Trump's online tirade is typical of him and should be no surprise, especially since the project doesn't show him in the best possible light. Given it was the movie's opening weekend, the film is more relevant than ever, and Trump doesn't miss a chance to also be present in any news story where his name is mentioned.It didn't take long for Abbasi to find out about Trump's post and the director soon took to his X page to release his own statement that thanked the presidential hopeful for getting back the film's movie team, saying that he's available to \"talk further if you want.\" However, in a bit of a cheeky response, Abbassi admitted to being busy with press for the film and said, \"But I might be able to give you a call tomorrow.\" So far, Trump hasn't responded to the director's recent post.The Apprentice Debuted to Lackluster Numbers Over the Weekend CloseThe Apprentice opened on 1,740 screens over the weekend, a respectable number for a film that once found it hard to find a distributor, but the movie was met with soft box office numbers, opening to just $1.58 million. Some people have made comments that the current presidential race has turned into quite a spectacle, so any film made about Trump, even if it doesn't touch on his current presidential aspirations, won't be as shocking or salacious as anything going on in his real life. Reviews for the film are good at 78% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, with an even more impressive 85% Popcornmeter that now measures audience reaction on the site. For those who have seen it, the response has appeared to be mostly positive, but being able to reach an audience that is on the fence about the film has been difficult so far.Related The Apprentice Distributor Slams Networks as Cowards After Controversial DecisionABC and CBS have made a decision regarding the upcoming Donald Trump biopic and the presidential debates.1After The Apprentice had its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, the Trump campaign threatened a lawsuit against the film in a statement released by the campaign's chief spokesperson, Steven Cheung. The statement read:\"We will be filing a lawsuit to address the blatantly false assertions from these pretend filmmakers. This garbage is pure fiction which sensationalizes lies that have been long debunked. As with the illegal Biden Trials, this is election interference by Hollywood elites, who know that President Trump will retake the White House and beat their candidate of choice because nothing they have done has worked.\"Written by Gabriel Sherman, The Apprentice tracks Trump's rise as a real estate businessman in New York in the 70s and 80s. The movie particularly focuses on his relationship with lawyer Roy Cohn and how Trump was guided under his mentorship. Of concern from the Trump campaign are likely certain scenes in the film that depict him in a negative light, including violently raping his first wife Ivana (Maria Bakalova) and undergoing cosmetic surgery. After the film's premiere at Cannes, the director addressed the statement that threatened legal action, and he made an offer to meet Trump in person to screen the film with him.\"I don't necessarily think that this is a movie he would dislike. I don't necessarily think he would like it. I think he would be surprised, you know? And like I've said before, I would offer to go and meet him wherever he wants and talk about the context of the movie, have a screening and have a chat afterwards, if that's interesting to anyone at the Trump campaign.\"The Apprentice is now playing in theaters nationwide.4/5 The ApprenticeSet during the early years of Trump's business career, the film focuses on the relationship of Trump and Roy Cohn, a New York City prosecutor known for working with Senator Joseph McCarthy during the Second Red Scare.",

Trump has demanded that Vice President Kamala Harris undergo a test for cognitive stamina and agility, igniting a fierce debate over her mental acuity and the integrity of the media.Taking to social media, Trump expressed his concerns, asserting, \"Her actions have led many to believe that there could be something very wrong with her.\"The provocative statement comes on the heels of a contentious media appearance by Harris, during which Trump alleged that CBS and 60 minutes attempted to shield her by \"illegally and unscrupulously\" replacing a controversial answer with a response unrelated to the original question.Trump's tirade, laden with his trademark hyperbole, accused Harris of being \"slow and lethargic\" in her responses, claiming that even the simplest inquiries leave her fumbling for answers.\"We just went through almost four years of that; we shouldn't have to do it again!\" he exclaimed, evoking memories of his own tumultuous presidency.The former president's comments have set off a political firestorm, with supporters rallying around his call for transparency, while opponents vehemently defend Harris's competence and ability to serve in her role.Critics have dismissed Trump's remarks as an unfounded attack aimed at undermining Harris's position and credibility, asserting that such demands are unbecoming of a former president.Political analysts speculate that Trump's incendiary remarks may be part of a broader strategy to galvanise his base ahead of the 2024 presidential election, while also serving to divert attention from his own legal challenges.As the political landscape grows increasingly polarized, the fallout from Trump's statement is sure to resonate in the weeks to come, prompting discussions around cognitive testing, media accountability, and the implications of political rhetoric in the current climate.The White House has yet to respond officially to Trump's accusations, but Harris's supporters remain steadfast, insisting that her capability as vice president is beyond question.The debate has intensified, with both sides preparing for an escalating war of words as the nation approaches a pivotal election year.In a climate charged with tension and division, Trump's latest remarks underscore the deepening rift within American politics, leaving many to wonder how far this battle for the narrative will go.",

    "title": "JD Vance and the GOP's Long Game",
    "content": "The 2024 presidential election has shaped up to be more than just another cycle of political showmanship - it's a carefully orchestrated strategy by the far-right to reshape the American political landscape for generations to come. At the center of this chess game is JD Vance, the Ohio senator who emerged from the shadows of political obscurity to become a rising star in conservative circles. His potential role as Donald Trump's running mate, coupled with his involvement in Project 2025, is a crucial piece of a long game designed to upend American democracy as we know it.Before JD Vance became a potential running mate for Donald Trump, he was one of Trump's most vocal critics. During the 2016 election, Vance openly condemned Trump, describing him as \"noxious\" and warning that his divisive rhetoric was dangerous for the country. As the Yale-educated author of Hillbilly Elegy, Vance positioned himself as an opponent of Trump's populism, believing his presidency would have disastrous consequences. On the eighth anniversary of a 2016 tweet where he reflected on his disapproval of Trump, he wrote, \"Trump makes people I care about - immigrants, Muslims, etc. - afraid. Because of this, I found him objectionable. God wants better for us.\"However, as Trump's influence within the Republican Party grew stronger, Vance underwent a significant political shift. He gradually aligned himself with Trumpism, embracing the policies he once criticized. This transformation was not just opportunistic but part of Vance's more enormous ambition to rise within the GOP, ultimately positioning him as a potential running mate for Trump.The Long Game: JD Vance as Trump's Running MateJD Vance's ascendancy in the Republican Party seems to have been deliberately engineered. Once a critic of Trump, Vance transformed himself into a fervent supporter of the former president's policies and persona. His alignment with Trumpism was not merely opportunistic but strategic, positioning himself as a bridge between Trump's base and the far-right intellectual movement.The notion of Vance as Trump's running mate plays into a larger conservative plan that doesn't necessarily rely on Trump serving a full term. If Trump wins in 2024, his presidency could be brief, with his apparent cognitive decline and poor health, the 25th Amendment looming as a potential exit strategy. The 25th Amendment allows for the removal of a president who is \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office,\" a tool that could be used by Republicans, especially if Trump's legal troubles, health, or mental fitness become problematic.This is where Vance comes in. Vance represents a younger, ideologically extreme version of Trump, with a far deeper commitment to dismantling the structures of American democracy than Trump himself. The plan? Remove Trump under the guise of the 25th Amendment and elevate Vance, who would have the full backing of the conservative movement's infrastructure. This would be a bait-and-switch of epic proportions, placing an even more dangerous figure in the Oval Office.Project 2025: The Blueprint for the Far-Right TakeoverAt the heart of this conservative takeover is Project 2025, a plan spearheaded by groups like the Heritage Foundation and other influential far-right think tanks. Project 2025 outlines a roadmap for radically reshaping the federal government, including dismantling regulatory agencies, gutting civil service protections, and reshaping the judiciary to entrench conservative power further.Vance's involvement in Project 2025 underscores his deeply embedded in this agenda. Project 2025 doesn't just aim to reverse Biden-era policies; it seeks to return to a pre-1960s America, undoing civil rights legislation, environmental protections, and women's rights. This project envisions a country where executive power is vastly expanded, oversight is reduced, and dissent is quashed. Vance, who has openly criticized government bureaucracy and supports extreme conservative policies, is the perfect candidate to carry out such a vision.If Trump were elected and later removed, Vance could seamlessly continue the Project 2025 agenda with little opposition. His polished, intellectual demeanor makes him more palatable to mainstream conservatives than Trump ever was, but his policies would be far more devastating. Unlike Trump, who often governs based on impulse, Vance would govern with precision, systematically dismantling the very foundations of American democracy.The 25th Amendment as a Political ToolThe 25th Amendment was never meant to be used as a political weapon, but the far-right could quickly weaponize it to achieve its goals. Trump, despite his immense popularity among the Republican base, is an unpredictable figure. His bombastic style and erratic behavior make him vulnerable to removal, mainly if his legal challenges catch up with him. The right could invoke the 25th Amendment under the guise of Trump's inability to perform his duties while planning to replace him with a figure more aligned with their long-term goals.This is where Vance's appeal becomes even more critical. He offers the conservative right a way to achieve their ideological goals without the chaos that surrounds Trump. Vance, a calculated and disciplined politician, can execute Project 2025 without the distraction of scandal or incompetence. By removing Trump, the far-right could place a more practical but equally extreme leader in power, cloaking their authoritarian agenda in legitimacy.The Threat to American DemocracyJD Vance's potential rise to the presidency is not just a concern for liberals or moderates; it's a fundamental threat to the democracy that has defined the United States for centuries. Vance's alignment with Project 2025 shows that he is not interested in preserving the institutions of the American government but in remaking them to reflect a far-right, authoritarian vision. His policies would devastate the checks and balances system, erode civil liberties, and strip away the progress made on issues like racial justice, gender equality, and environmental protection.If Trump is elected and then removed under the 25th Amendment, a Vance presidency would be poised to accelerate the most radical aspects of Project 2025. Regulatory agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency could be gutted, effectively ending federal oversight on climate change and environmental justice issues. Civil rights protections, particularly for marginalized communities, could be rolled back under the guise of \"states' rights\" and \"individual freedom.\" The judiciary could be stacked with far-right judges, further entrenching conservative power for decades to come.Conclusion: A Bait-and-Switch of Epic Proportions HypotheticalThe 2024 election may seem like a repeat of past political cycles, but there's much more at stake. JD Vance as Donald Trump's running mate is not a coincidence; it's a strategic move by the conservative right to ensure that their radical agenda is carried out, even if Trump is removed from office. By using the 25th Amendment to elevate Vance, the far-right would not only continue their war on American democracy but would accelerate it in ways that even Trump has been unable to.The threat posed by this plan cannot be overstated. Under Vance's leadership, Project 2025 would systematically dismantle the pillars of American democracy, pushing the country toward an authoritarian regime disguised as populism. This is not just about electing a president; it's about changing the very fabric of the United States.If voters aren't paying attention, they could be in for the bait-and-switch of a lifetime - one that could devastate the democracy we know and cherish.",

Trump is played by the Marvel actor Sebastian Stan and Cohn by the Succession star Jeremy Strong.Trump's ex-wife Ivana Trump is played by Maria Bakalova - whose breakout role in Borat Subsequent Moviefilm landed her an Academy award nomination.

Trump said he hoped it would \"bomb\" and alleged that the was \"put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country, 'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!'\"The Apprentice has spurred praise and controversy since its premiere at the Cannes film festival in May. The screenwriter, Gabriel Sherman, described numerous roadblocks in its production.Actors were reluctant to \"humanize\" Trump, Sherman said in Vanity Fair, and Hollywood institutions did not want to fund the project. And, the most significant investor into this project allegedly threatened to kill the film after viewing it.This investor was Dan Snyder, a billionaire who formerly owned the NFL's Washington Commanders and a major Trump supporter. Snyder reportedly invested in The Apprentice through his son-in-law Mark Rapaport's film production company, Variety said.\"He was under the impression that it was a flattering portrayal of the 45th president,\" the outlet reported.The Apprentice is anything but. It contains a scene in which Trump's character appears to sexually assault his first wife, Ivana, takes amphetamines, undergoes liposuction, and receives a hair transplant.Ivana claimed that Trump raped her during a divorce deposition, but later recanted this allegation. Trump has denied attacking Ivana. Trump, who has been found liable of sexually abusing the writer E Jean Carroll in civil court, has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 20 women.Trump's lawyers sent The Apprentice's film-makers cease-and-desist letters, and prominent distributors would not go near it. \"Hollywood fashions itself as a community of truth tellers,\" Sherman said, \"but here they were running from a movie to prepare for a Trump presidency.\"In his social media attack posted just before 1am, Trump focused on the film's depiction of Ivana, who died in July 2022 after an accidental fall.\"My former wife, Ivana, was a kind and wonderful person, and I had a great relationship with her until the day she died,\" Trump wrote. \"The writer of this pile of garbage, Gabe Sherman, a lowlife and talentless hack, who has long been widely discredited, knew that, but chose to ignore it.\"So sad that HUMAN SCUM, like the people involved in this hopefully unsuccessful enterprise, are allowed to say and do whatever they want in order to hurt a Political Movement, which is far bigger than any of us.

This garbage is pure fiction which sensationalizes lies that have been long debunked,\" Steven Cheung, Trump campaign communications director, said in a statement.Cheung likened the film to purported \"witch-hunts\" by his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, saying it was \"election interference by Hollywood elites right before November, who know that President Trump will retake the White House and beat their candidate of choice because nothing they have done has worked.\"This 'film' is pure malicious defamation, should never see the light of day, and doesn't even deserve a place in the straight-to-DVD section of a bargain bin at a soon-to-be-closed discount movie store, it belongs in a dumpster fire,\" Cheung also said.",

    "title": "Opinion: A dark money group is trying to manipulate voters with ads about Oklahoma judges",
    "content": "Aside from 2024 presidential election race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, here are other key races to eye ahead of Election Day in November.There's been one -- and only one -- Oklahoma governmental body that we've been able to count on to restore sanity and stay out of the day-to-day political brawls and power struggles playing out in the state Capitol.The Oklahoma Supreme Court.So I guess it was only a matter of time before a group of conservatives took a whirl at dragging our highest court into the muck with the other branches of state government.A conservative group cloaked in shadows launched a campaign urging voters to boot three of Supreme Court justices: Noma Gurich, Yvonne Kauger and James Edmondson. The group is hoping to tilt the power on the court using our normally benign retention elections -- a section of the ballot that you've likely not paid much attention to before.Retention ballot measures ask voters a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" question about whether appointed judges should continue to serve after their official appointment period ends (and at the Supreme Court level, they traditionally do).More: Ads target Oklahoma Supreme Court justices over 'padding the pockets of trial lawyers'Oklahoma voters have never not retained a justice. Yes, that was a double negative for emphasis. In other words, Oklahoma voters have always said an appointed judge placed on the ballot should keep serving.In hindsight, I'm surprised it took so long for someone to try to use our election system to manipulate voters into altering the Oklahoma Supreme Court's makeup through retention elections.After all, our justices have been busy for years now striking fear into the hearts of lawmakers and special interests groups by axing loads of patently unconstitutional laws that have the grubby fingerprints of lobbyists and activists all over them.Our justices have struck down: abortion bans, a law that restricted when schools could require masks, a cap on pain and suffering damages, a liquor law that sought to control alcohol sales, tort reform, special fees on electric and hybrid vehicles, a Ten Commandments monument at the state Capitol and the existence of the nation's first publicly funded religious charter school.I'm going to stop there with the caveat that that's just a fraction of what they've done.More: Does my vote matter? Where your vote in Oklahoma can make a differenceJust looking at the list of all the unconstitutional -- and sometimes downright bonkers -- legislation that our Court has rejected makes me a little queasy.So let's pause for a respectful moment of silence as the mournful sounds of taps begin to sound in the distance.After all, what could go wrong if we metaphorically dropped a lit match into a gas-filled room and handed our monied special interests groups the keys to the last independent vestige that remains standing in our kingdom?Kablam!Because if these conservative activists have their way and manage to convince voters to do the unthinkable and fire three justices in one swoop, we'll be obliterating the system of checks and balances that we've come to rely on and heralding a new era where we have a judiciary beholden to those that have the money to keep them in office and power.There's a reason why there are three branches of government. They keep each other in check.I'm not sorry that some people are butthurt over our high court's decisions, but I am fearful that they think Oklahoma voters are dumb enough to begin the process of further politicizing our judiciary.Why?I find it very suspicious that the three justices being targeted by the group People for Opportunity were all appointed by former Democratic governors and are being highlighted as \"liberal.\"And I'm concerned that opponents of the judges are running a smear campaign that reeks of age discrimination. The ads point out that these folks are all over the age of 70. Are they suggesting that once someone turns 70, it's time to put them out to pasture, and they're of no more use to society? (Lest we forget the role age has played in another election this year, former President Donald Trump is 78.)I'm not naive enough to think our Supreme Court is free of political intrigue. These days nothing is. But right now, we're successfully managing to navigate a fine line, and I don't feel like our court resembles the very partisan U.S. Supreme Court.I'd like to keep it that way.In addition, we don't even know who is funding this late-election campaign.The source of the group's funding and broader membership is -- legally -- blocked from the public's view. Dare I call it dark money? We know members of the conservative Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs are involved because they're one of the few that's had the guts to put their names and faces on the effort.But at this point, pretty much everyone else is skulking creepily in the shadows, egging this on from the slimy sewers.If this is so great, put your name and face on it.I fear the shadowy operatives believe they can convince Gov. Kevin Stitt to put puppets on the bench that are more favorable to their causes, which is bad news for the average Oklahoman.It turns out the money and influence special interests wield in the halls of our Capitol doesn't spend as well in our Supreme Court.But the campaign backers are banking on the fact that voters know very little about our Supreme Court justices.And, they'd be right.Judicial ethics prevents judges facing retention votes from campaigning unless there's active opposition to their remaining in the post.It's expensive to wage a statewide election campaign. Candidates often have to accept money from those they'll help regulate, which can later raise thorny ethical questions.Our justices don't campaign, and that's the way it should be.The good news is voters have some time to think about the path they want for the Oklahoma Supreme Court.Unlike our Republican primaries, everyone gets to weigh in on this outcome.",

Today is a tight day  a lot of press for  but I might be able to give you a call tomorrow.\"What is the Donald Trump movie The Apprentice?The Apprentice is a new movie based on the early rise of Trump as a real estate businessman. It depicts his ascension beyond the shadow of his father, Fred Trump, and his relationship with lawyer Roy Cohn.After premiering at the 2024 Cannes International Film Festival, The Apprentice found distribution. Briarcliff Entertainment acquired the rights to distribute the movie, releasing it on October 11, 2024.Sebastian Stan, known for playing Bucky Barnes/the Winter Soldier in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), starred as Trump in the movie. Jeremy Strong and Maria Bakalova portrayed Roy Cohn and Ivana Trump, respectively.Ali Abbasi directed The Apprentice and is best known for directing Shelley and Holy Spider. The writer, Gabriel Sherman, who Trump called a \"lowlife and talentless hack,\" previously wrote a biography about Fox News Channel's president, Roger Ailes.Despite generally positive reviews -- it holds a 78% from critics on Rotten Tomatoes -- The Apprentice has not been a box office hit. During its opening weekend, it grossed under $1.6 million domestically.That was less than other new releases like Terrifier 3 ($18.3 million), Piece by Piece ($3.8 million), and My Hero Academia: You're Next ($3 million).It did make more than two other new releases, Average Joe ($1.1 million) and We Live in Time ($225,911). However, the latter had its limited release last weekend, only playing in five theaters. It averaged $45,182 per theater, easily the highest of the weekend.",

    "content": "GEORGIA, -- As voters prepare to brave the lines for the 2024 Presidential Election, 11Alive wants citizens to be informed of changes in Georgia's 2024 election process. Here are the key details about Georgia's Election Integrity Act 2021, or Law S.B. 202.The law, which faced much scrutiny during its revision, has five central elements: New restrictions on the use of drop boxes and mobile voting, changes in absentee and provisional ballots, and an expansion on where people can serve as poll workers.RELATED: 11Alive 2024 election county-by-county voter guide | Fulton, Gwinnett, DeKalb, Cobb and ClaytonVoters now need to provide their driver's license number or specified voter ID, request their ballot at least 11 days before the election, and use an updated absentee ballot form.The rules for absentee ballots were less stringent before SB 202, with no requirement for a driver's license number or specific voter ID. Additionally, the timeline for requesting absentee ballots was more flexible, giving voters until the Friday before Election Day.Counties are now limited to one drop box per 100,000 registered voters. Drop boxes must be located at the office of the board of registrars, absentee ballot clerk, or inside advance voting locations, adding that they can only be opened while the voting is being conducted.Previously, there was no restriction on the number of drop boxes, their service times, or their location.The law makes it a misdemeanor to give away food or water within 150 feet of the outer edge of a polling place building or within 25 feet of any voter in line. Voters can bring their own food and refreshments with them to stand in line. Poll workers can make available \"self-service water from an unattended receptacle to an elector waiting in line to vote.\"This only applied to campaign materials, petition signatures, and setting up tables within 150 feet of the outer edge of a polling place building or within 25 feet of any voter in line.Provisional ballots cast in the wrong precinct will only count if cast after 5 p.m. Voters who arrive at the wrong precinct before 5 p.m. will be directed to their correct precinct.Voters who went to the wrong precinct on Election Day could cast a provisional ballot and cast a ballot for any race at that precinct if they were eligible.Mobile voting units can only be used during declared disasters under SB 202.Mobile units were introduced and used to expand early voting opportunities.Changes allow poll workers to serve in adjoining counties, expanding the pool of eligible workers.Poll workers were required to be residents or employees of the county they wished to serve.Other changes included in House Bill 1118 to protect poll workers were re-introduced in February following the experience of former Fulton County election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss. The mother-daughter duo endured death threats from across the nation after former President Donald Trump and his attorney Rudy Giuliani accused them of election fraud, a claim that was quickly debunked.If it becomes law, the bill would expand current protections to all election workers, such as contract workers, part-time workers, seasonal workers, and credentialed observers. It would also protect an election worker's personal information from Freedom of Information requests.Rep. Saira Draper, Georgia House Representative for District 90, sponsors the bill. She said she is also adding language to the bill requiring the State Election Board to compile a report about how many threats are reported to the Attorney General's hotline.RELATED: New changes could come to Georgia poll worker protection bill",

    "title": "Presidents of the United States: Franklin Pierce, the man who opened the door to Civil War",
    "content": "Editor's Note: This is part of a series of profiles taking a closer look at US presidents ahead of the 2024 presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.Though Franklin Pierce came to the White House during a time of apparent peace, the undercurrents of conflict between the north and south over slavery were already growing stronger.The US had attempted to deal with the subject through the Missouri Compromise of 1820, but tensions between the two halves of the country remained ready to combust.Pierce, from New England and at the time the youngest man to hold the office, proclaimed an era of peace and prosperity were at hand when he was sworn in.Events were to prove him wrong.Let's take a closer look at the 14th president of the United States.Early yearsPierce was born on November 23, 1804, in New Hampshire's Hillsboro. His parents were Benjamin and Anna Pierce. His father was a governor.Pierce went to Bowdoin College in Maine and studied law in Massachusetts. He was admitted to the bar and then married Jane Means Appleton in 1834.PoliticsPierce entered politics in 1829 as a Democrat. He served in the New Hampshire legislature before becoming Speaker of the House. He was then elected to the House of Representatives and the Senate.Though Pierce was popular in Congress because of his good looks and fine oratory, he accomplished little of note. He then left politics for personal reasons and returned to New Hampshire where he resumed his practice.Pierce next served as an officer in the Mexican-American War and rose to the rank of brigadier, but otherwise kept out of the public eye.Then, in 1852, the Democrats were at a deadlock at their political convention. After 35 rounds of ballots, Pierce's name was proposed as the candidate. Pierce, ever a moderate, was little known. Better still, he was amenable to all parties.By round 48, the nomination was his. His wife Jane, however, was not pleased at all. Jane by all accounts disdained politics. So much so that Pierce had to reassure her that he was not seeking the nomination. Upon learning that her husband had obtained the nomination, Jane fainted.Pierce easily defeated Whig Party nominee Winfield Scott - who incidentally had commanded Pierce during the war.Tragedy struck the Pierces before he even took office. Months before the swearing-in, they lost their only surviving child - eleven-year-old Benny - in a train accident. Worse, both parents witnessed the tragedy. It was a blow from which neither of them, particularly Jane, would fully recover.Pierce was sworn in sans an inaugural ball and the First Lady missing from his side.Time in officeThe issue of slavery hung over the entire nation - and the Pierce administration. Pierce attempted to stack his cabinet with people from both sides of the divide, but that did not help matters.The appointment of Jefferson David - who would go on to become the president of the Confederacy - as Secretary of War drew howls of derision from those who were anti-slavery Pierce as president pushed for and signed the Kansas-Nebraska Act - which repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820 that had sought to keep slavery limited to the southern states.This was one of the most important pieces of legislation, and consequential moments, in US history. The Act would set the stage for the rise of the Republican Party and Abraham Lincoln and set America inexorably on the path towards the Civil War. The resulting battle known as 'Bleeding Kansas' between pro and anti-slavery supporters would be a bloody prologue of what was to come.By now a divisive figure, Pierce became the first sitting president seeking a second term who was denied by the party. The Democrats instead chose James Buchanan, who would win the presidency. Pierce toured Europe, then returned to New Hampshire and quietly retired from public life.Now, slavery was Buchanan's problem - and it would soon be up to Lincoln to solve the issue once and for all. Pierce, who had drunk heavily throughout his life, became an alcoholic and passed away in 1869.LegacyHistorians do not view Pierce kindly. After all, it was under his auspices that the path to near ruin - Civil War - was laid. However, it is undeniable that events and pieces of legislation that would go down in history, occurred under his tenure.Pierce should perhaps be viewed as a cautionary tale of what a leader should not be in times of strife.",

    "content": "The judge in Donald Trump's election-fraud case doesn't care that the allegations may embarrass him in election season, a former prosecutor has said.Judge Tanya Chutkan has ordered the release of yet more explosive evidence in the case, despite objections from Trump's attorneys that it could be damaging at election time.The Republican presidential nominee is accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States; conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding; obstruction and attempting to obstruct an official proceeding; and conspiracy against rights in connection with an alleged pressure campaign on state officials to reverse the 2020 election results.The former president has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him and repeatedly said he is the victim of a political witch hunt. He has accused chief prosecutor Jack Smith of attempting to interfere in the 2024 presidential election by prosecuting him. Newsweek sought email comment from Trump's attorney on Monday.Writing in her legal blog, Civil Discourse, on Sunday, former federal prosecutor and frequent critic of Trump, Joyce Vance, noted that Chutkan has repeatedly told the Republican's lawyers that his embarrassment is irrelevant to the case. \"Judge Chutkan continues to show a total lack of interest in Trump's argument that nothing can become public because of the election,\" Vance wrote.She noted that, in an order on October 10, Chutkan wrote, \"Defendant's concern with the political consequences of these proceedings is not a cognizable legal prejudice\" that would merit sealing the evidence further. Chutkan granted prosecutors' motion that an appendix of evidence in the case should be released. However, she has given Trump until October 17 to decide how to examine any legal options that might prevent the release.Trump's lawyers had requested \"that the Court stay that determination for a reasonable period of time so that  can evaluate litigation options relating to the decision.\"On October 2, Chutkan unsealed a 165-page evidence brief in the case, against the wishes of Trump and his lawyers, who argued that it could damage the Republican nominee during the presidential election cycle.The brief contained new information about Trump's alleged activities during the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol in 2021.The brief detailed his alleged indifference to the fate of Vice President Mike Pence as pro-Trump rioters hunted for him in the Capitol.It added that Trump's team had tried to garner support for a flawed report into alleged voter machine fraud in Michigan. The then-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee refused to publish the report and told Trump it was \"f***ing nuts.\"The latest proposed release concerns a substantial appendix to the 165-page evidence brief. That appendix has never been seen by the public and contains further allegations against the former president.Trump's lawyers had requested that \"no further disclosures\" of \"so-called evidence\" be released because it had been \"unlawfully cherry-picked and mischaracterized\" by the prosecutor's office.",

    "content": "With the 2024 US Presidential Election nearing, third-party candidates Jill Stein and Chase Oliver could influence key battleground states. Democrats worry Stein could benefit Trump's reelection, prompting targeted ads. Both Stein and Oliver emphasize alternative policies, impacting the close race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Voter outreach becomes crucial in swaying undecided voters.With just a month left for the high-stakes US Presidential election 2024, third-party and independent presidential candidates are adding an unpredictable element with every battleground state has at least one such candidate on the ballot. As the time for the 2024 US Presidential election draws closer, independent candidates continue to pose fresh challenges for presidential hopefuls Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.Jill Stein of the Green Party and Chase Oliver of the Libertarian Party are polling at about 1% nationally, according to New York Times polling. Same with Chase Oliver, the Libertarian Party candidate. Although these candidates will not win, they could impact the major party candidates' chances in close states through the \"spoiler\" effect.Bernard Tamas, political science professor at Valdosta State University, said, \"This may wind up being very, very close in these key swing states.\"ALSO READ: Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett silent on backing Kamala Harris as US presidential candidate. Has Trump earned their support?Democrats are particularly concerned. Rahna Epting, executive director of MoveOn, said, \"The presidential race could very well come down to a few thousand votes in a handful of states. These third-party candidates -- they still remain a big threat this cycle.\"Democrats worry mostly about Stein. On Friday, the Democratic National Committee released ads in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, stating that \"A vote for Stein is really a vote for Trump.\" Trump has expressed support for Stein at a rally.ALSO READ: This Jupiter moon to become another Earth?In Michigan, Stein and West could pose threats to Harris. West faced challenges in various states, including Georgia, where he was disqualified.Kennedy, who had an unusual campaign, endorsed Trump after dropping out. Despite efforts to remove himself from some ballots, he remains on the ballots in Wisconsin and Michigan.Stein will appear on ballots in 38 states, including key battlegrounds. Media representatives for the Green Party did not respond for comments, but Stein claimed, \"The system is complicated by design.\"The Democratic National Committee released its first-ever television ad targeting Jill Stein as a spoiler who only benefits Donald Trump's reelection. The ad follows Stein's growing support among Arab Americans and Muslims in battleground states like Michigan, Arizona and Wisconsin where they have large populations.\"The Democrats have lost the Muslim American and the Arab American vote,\" Stein told Reuters after a rally attended by about 100 people in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn on Sunday. \"They're going to be losing enough swing states that they will not win and they cannot win.\"ALSO READ: Stunning discovery in Denmark: 50 exceptionally well preserved skeletons unearthed. Do they hint at hidden society?Jill Stein, an activist and doctor, announced her presidential run with the Green Party and previously ran for president in 2012 and 2016. Some Democrats believe her campaign in 2016 contributed to Donald Trump's victory. As a candidate, Stein promotes an \"economic bill of rights,\" including universal healthcare and the right to a job. She also advocates for climate change action, abortion access, and transgender rights.Stein recently participated in a protest in Gaza, where she was arrested. Despite her support, she is not expected to win more than 2% of the vote, which could potentially impact Vice President Kamala Harris's chances.In 2016, Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump by fewer votes than Stein received in three key states. Stein has accused Democrats of attempting to keep her off state ballots to maintain their power. Currently, she is on the ballot in at least four states, with her running mate Butch Ware, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.At a rally in June, Trump praised Stein. \"I like her very much,\" he said. \"You know why? She takes 100% from them.\"Stein argues that people often vote \"against someone they dislike\" rather than for someone they truly support.ALSO READ: Meet the most beautiful women in the world. Know the science behind their beautyChase Oliver is the Libertarian Party's candidate for president. The Libertarian Party, the third-largest political party in the US, typically draws voters who favor smaller government and more individual freedom. Oliver, a 40-year-old sales executive from Georgia, previously ran for Congress.Oliver argues that voters no longer want to choose \"the lesser of two evils.\" His campaign platform includes balancing the federal budget, ending military support to Israel and Ukraine, closing US military bases overseas, and abolishing the death penalty.Libertarian candidates generally secure 1-3% of the vote, mainly drawing support from Republicans. In the 2020 presidential election, the Libertarian candidate's votes in three key battleground states outnumbered the margin by which Donald Trump lost those states. If those votes had gone to Trump, he might have won those states and potentially altered the overall election outcome.Wisconsin has a particularly crowded ballot. In addition to Trump and Harris, voters will be able to choose among Stein and Oliver; Cornel West, a theologian and independent candidate; Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the former independent candidate who now backs Trump; Randall Terry, the nominee for the Constitution Party; and Claudia De la Cruz, the nominee for the Party for Socialism and Liberation.Julia Azari, political science professor at Marquette University, said, \"Any story we try to tell about that will be based on assumptions about what candidate they might have preferred as a second choice.\"Democrats have also targeted outside candidates by challenging ballot applications with mixed results. Epting mentioned they are now focused on direct voter outreach, saying, \"The more we engage the voters, especially hard-to-reach voters on this election, and talk to them about Kamala Harris' agenda for this country, that is an incredibly effective strategy.\"Additionally, Democrats have accused Republican operatives of assisting outsider candidates like West. Edwin DeJesus of the West campaign denied these allegations.",

Rory McIlroy became an early victim of the trend with one pundit comparing his U.S. Open choke job earlier this year to Kamala Harris' failures within the media.During Sunday's edition of 'This Week' on ABC, political analyst Reince Priebus brought up the fact that Republicans are leading Democrats in the ABC/IPSOS poll for the first time in 32 years.Priebus went on to deliver a strong opinion that Harris' messaging and inability to say anything meaningful in front of a camera, followed by her failed attempt at stopping the bleeding, is turning voters off. This then led him into lobbing a stray in McIlroy's direction.\"She had a terrible week,\" Priebus said of Harris. \"She picked a pointless fight with Ron DeSantis, she's losing in the Sun Belt, and she tried to recover by going on 'The View' which a lot of women watch.\"\"She wanted to clarify the two most important issues that are facing these two candidates, the economy and immigration, and she bombed like Rory  at the U.S. Open and she went on there and said that there was nothing she would do that would be different than Joe Biden and she created a campaign commercial for Donald Trump.\"Harris' appearance on 'The View' should have been the layup of all layups for her campaign, yet it turned into a dumpster fire with her admitting that she wouldn't change a single thing the Biden administration implemented.McIlroy's collapse at Pinehurst this summer was one of the most shocking we've seen in recent sports history, yet Harris moving backward in certain polls after appearing on an anti-Trump, anti-Republican talk show could prove to be even worse.",

    "title": "Illinois officials battle misinformation to protect integrity of November election",
    "content": "At the Sulzer Regional Library on a recent Wednesday night, an informational video and hands-on demonstration tried to ease voters' concerns with a blunt message: \"You can trust the voting machines.\"But the less than a dozen attendees, huddled in a semicircle around a voting machine, still had plenty of questions about what would come next on Election Day.They wondered: How are election judges vetted? Is there any way an election judge could sabotage somebody's vote? How protected are city servers from being hacked? Are governments like Russia and China accessing voting records?It was the first of three voting machine demonstrations the Chicago Board of Elections is hosting in the run-up to the Nov. 5 election, where election security is at the forefront of voters' minds.Russian influence and false claims of a rigged election plagued the last two presidential elections. This time, Illinois election officials said disinformation poses the biggest threat to the integrity of the vote.Bad actors both domestically and abroad \"re trying to get into the minds of voters, and they're trying to pit voters against each other,\" said Matt Dietrich, spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections.Through The Democracy Solutions Project, WBEZ, the Chicago Sun-Times and the University of Chicago's Center for Effective Government at the Harris School of Public Policy are examining the challenges to our democracy and potential solutions in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election.Illinois, a reliably blue state that has voted for the Democratic nominee in the last eight presidential elections, hasn't seen the same specters of conspiracy theories and allegations of fraud that have taken root in states like Arizona and Georgia.Case in point: A state-commissioned task force was created in 2022 to issue recommendations to combat foreign interference and cyberattacks in the run-up to the November election. It never even saw members appointed.Finding available experts who weren't already involved in similar efforts \"proved to be difficult,\" said John Patterson, spokesman for Illinois Senate President Don Harmon, and lawmakers didn't want to get in the way of the State Board of Elections' own security efforts.\"So the decision was made to shift gears and work directly with state elections officials and the Illinois Attorney General's office to identify issues and concerns as they pop up and address them through the legislative process,\" Patterson said in a statement, pointing to a recent state law that addressed publication of voters' personal information.In parts of the country, election authorities are adding bulletproof glass and panic buttons. Illinois officials say they're taking precautions -- though less extreme ones, from having Narcan on hand in case of fentanyl-laced suspicious packages to adding security officers for election sites and giving election workers more protections, like leaving their names off IDs. The FBI is investigating suspicious packages received by the Illinois State Board of Elections and officials across the country, although Chicago and Cook County said they had not received similar threats.\"We do have to prepare for the worst,\" Chicago Board of Elections spokesman Max Bever said. \"No matter what.\"In addition to election judges and poll watchers, over 400 polling place investigators, who are often off-duty or retired law enforcement, are hired for early voting and Election Day in Chicago, Bever said. The Cook County clerk's office has increased physical security for early voting sites, mail ballot deliveries and pickups and at the operations center and main office, said Edmund Michalowski, the Cook County deputy clerk of elections. Security will be provided through the Cook County Sheriff's Office and a private security firm.\"We doubled it for this 2024 November for two reasons,\" Michalowski said. \"One, that obviously the election is a really hot topic around the country. But also, it's going to probably be close to 70% turnout, so it's nice to have more people ... that we can make sure that we have enough people on site to take care of the needs of the voters.\"A new provision in state law went into effect in July that no longer requires election judges to have their name displayed on ID badges, in an attempt to shield workers from personal retribution, Dietrich said.Illinois voters will also be weighing whether to give election workers more protections through an advisory referendum on the November ballot. It asks whether candidates should be subject to civil penalties for attempting to interfere with an election worker's duties. State Rep. Jay Hoffman, who sponsored the legislation putting the question before voters, said that could encompass anything from threats to acts of violence against workers.\"It's one thing to allege fraud. It's another thing to threaten an election worker,\" Hoffman said. \"First of all, it's against every democratic principle we have ever, as a country, stood for. But secondly, it's going to have a chilling effect.\"Voting equipment is also getting more enhancements. Each of the more than 1,400 large metal cabinets which house voting equipment to be sent to each precinct across the suburbs is now equipped with a GPS tracking device, \"so we know exactly where it is,\" Michalowski said.After Russian hackers infiltrated Illinois' voter registration database in 2016, the Illinois State Board of Elections has created a division of information security, partnered with the Illinois National Guard to tap its cybersecurity experts and bolstered resources and training for election authorities throughout the state.At the voting demonstration, Bever ticked through the many layers of safeguards that are already in place.Each election machine undergoes tests. They are never connected to the internet. Officials keep a strict chain of custody, documenting each person who has inspected a machine. Voting equipment and ballots are secured and transported under video surveillance. Chicago has no drive-through drop boxes. Paper ballots are only printed by approved shops to ensure they meet specifications and can be read by scanners.\"Illinois is still an all-paper-ballot state, so no matter which way you vote, either on a touch screen or by paper ballot, there's always going to be a paper trail,\" Bever said. \"And that's important, because paper ballots can be reviewed for audits and recounts as necessary, and the voter can always review their choices on the ballots.\"But Bever called for more funding to safeguard ballots, arguing that it's getting more expensive to keep up with sophisticated threats.During the COVID-19 pandemic, West Ridge resident Mary Dudek witnessed misinformation around the coronavirus and vaccines unfold in real time at the federally qualified health center where she worked. It was staggering and disappointing, she said. Now she fears it's happening again -- this time with the election.\"I was shocked by how impacted we all were from that misinformation, and now I'm seeing that same kind of process unfolding again,\" Dudek said. \"So it's very worrisome.\"A recent poll by the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that a majority surveyed (78%) feel the spread of misinformation about the government is a major problem. Of those surveyed, 39% found it very or somewhat difficult to know if what candidates are saying is true or not.At the voting machine demonstration at Sulzer library, Dudek was hoping to learn more strategies to help the average person sift through the noise.\"It's just one thing after another. And if you are trying to stay on top of things, these are challenging times, because there's so much that is painful going on,\" she said.Nonpartisan voting groups and election authorities are launching new concerted efforts to help voters discern for themselves. The Illinois Attorney General's Office offers tips on how to spot artificially generated images. Public service announcements sponsored by the Illinois State Board of Elections are airing across hundreds of radio and television stations in Illinois; they encourage voters to turn to their election authorities for the most trusted info.\"We do not want to alienate them or create this 'us against you' environment where they feel like they're being insulted,\" Dietrich said, noting he avoids using terms like \"election denier.\" \"We want to get them back to where they always were before, where inherently, they trusted elections -- that elections in the United States are secure.\"The League of Women Voters of Illinois has marshaled its members to debunk common myths and teach media literacy through its new Mis/Disinformation Task Force. Its website features a toolkit and talks from experts on everything from protecting democracy in the age of social media and artificial intelligence to talking with people who disagree with you.\"If you argue with people, that doesn't work. What works is listening to them, asking questions, asking them to start questioning on their own,\" said Anne Sullivan, co-chair of the Mis/Disinformation Task Force.Barb Laimins, co-chair of the task force, has a new motto that is an old adage of journalists: If your mother says she loves you, check it out. If people have questions about election security, Laimins said there's no better way to get answers than signing up to work as an election judge.\"When you become an election judge, you become the perfect purveyor of accurate information and support of our election systems,\" Laimins said.",

    "content": "This article contains a discussion of sexual assault.Former President of the United States and \"Home Alone 2\" actor Donald Trump isn't happy about how he's portrayed in the explosive new biopic \"The Apprentice.\" The movie, which stars Sebastian Stan as Trump, takes a searing look at Trump's real-estate career in New York in the 1970s and 1980s, and though it's not exactly clear if Trump has seen the film, he does not like it.The film officially released in the United States on Friday, October 11, and Trump quickly took to Truth Social, his social media platform, to put the movie on blast. (Any and all grammatical errors, errant capitalizations, and typos are the presidential candidate's own.)\"A FAKE and CLASSLESS Movie written about me, called, 'The Apprentice' (Do they even have the right to use that name without approval?), will hopefully 'bomb,'\" the Republican candidate for president wrote. \"It's a cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country, 'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!'\"Trump then addressed some of the film's darker elements, including a scene that depicts him sexually assaulting his first wife, the late Ivana Trump (played by Maria Bakalova in the film). \"My former wife, Ivana, was a kind and wonderful person, and I had a great relationship with her until the day she died,\" he continued. \"The writer of this pile of garbage, Gabe Sherman, a lowlife and talentless hack, who has long been widely discredited, knew that, but chose to ignore it.

Ivana died in 2022.Screenwriter Gabriel Sherman told Entertainment Weekly that the \"most shocking\" moments in the film are all based on \"real events.\" \"The funny thing is, everything in the movie that seems the most shocking is actually completely based on real events,\" he said. \"Very little has been dramatized. It's one of these stories where the truth is stranger than fiction.\"What was the relationship between Trump and Roy Cohn?Sherman said there was a father-son dynamic to their relationship but on another level, there was a \"homoerotic subtext\". \"One of the things I found in my research is that a lot of Roy's lovers were young, blond, blue-eyed men who bore a striking resemblance to young Donald. I think Roy was attracted to Trump, in a way, and this movie is sort of a love story,\" Sherman said.Did Trump 'rape' Ivana?USA Today reported that there is a stomach-churning scene in the movie where Donald tells Ivana that he's no longer attracted to her. Ivana retorts that Donald is fat and balding. \"Donald throws Ivana to the floor and climbs on top of her, proceeding to sexually assault his wife as she screams for him to stop,\" the report said.\"The alleged rape is taken from a court deposition \"that Ivana gave under oath during her 1990 divorce,\" Sherman said. \"In fact, the scene she described in the divorce papers was actually far more graphic and brutal than the one we dramatized in the film.\"At TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Shop now and get 10% off with code RB10. Vet & LEO-founded.Trump emphasized that the decision was unanimous, describing it as \"thousands of people\" coming together in support.Paul Perez, the president of the National Border Patrol Council, joined Trump on stage to address the crowd.Perez delivered a strong message, warning of the consequences if Kamala Harris wins the 2024 election. \"If we allow border czar Harris to win this election, every city, every community in this great country is going to go to hell,\" Perez said, citing the influx of unvetted individuals who have entered the country, leading to increased crime rates including \"murders, rapes, robberies, and burglaries.\"Perez voiced his support for Trump as the only candidate capable of resolving the border crisis. \"Only one man can fix that. That is Donald J. Trump,\" he told the crowd, adding that Trump has consistently stood by the men and women protecting the border and risking their lives for the country.Perez also emphasized the stark choice voters face in November: either allow the chaos to continue at the southern border with criminal cartels controlling drug and human trafficking, or vote to restore order.He highlighted the threat posed by the smuggling of drugs, particularly fentanyl, which has devastated communities across the nation.\"On behalf of the 16,000 men and women represented by the National Border Patrol Council, we strongly support and endorse Donald J. Trump for President of the United States,\" Perez declared, signaling the union's firm backing for Trump.Following the endorsement, Trump expressed his appreciation for the council, calling them an \"incredible group of people\" and reiterating his commitment to supporting the agents who protect the U.S. border.As Trump continues to campaign for votes in key battleground states, he took the opportunity at the rally to criticize Kamala Harris and vowed never to allow the U.S. military to become \"woke.\" During the event, Trump also showed a clip from the film Full Metal Jacket on a screen behind him, featuring R. Lee Ermey's drill sergeant character, before humorously transitioning into a mock \"pride month\" announcement.In addition to addressing border security, Trump promised to prioritize reducing violent crime and supporting law enforcement if elected.The rally in Arizona, a critical swing state, is part of Trump's broader effort to galvanize voters ahead of the November 2024 election.According to a recent poll conducted by the Wall Street Journal, the race between Trump and Harris remains extremely close in several key battleground states.The survey, conducted between September 28 and October 8, found that Trump and Harris are tied in North Carolina and Wisconsin, while Harris holds slight leads in Arizona and Georgia.Trump's biggest advantage is in Nevada, where he leads Harris 49% to 43%. Pennsylvania also remains close, with Trump leading 47% to 46%.Voters in the poll indicated they trust Trump more when it comes to handling the economy, inflation, and border security.As the election nears, both candidates are expected to intensify their efforts to win over voters in these key states.The opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of LifeZette.

    "content": "Former president calls film about his rise in real estate in 1970s and 80s a 'politically disgusting hatchet job'Donald Trump railed against a just released biopic about his life in a social media screed early on Monday, calling it a \"cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job\" meant to thwart his presidential candidacy.The Apprentice portrays how Trump created his real estate empire under the tutelage of Roy Cohn, a notoriously cutthroat attorney and power-broker in 1970s and 1980s New York City, Intelligencer notes. Trump is played by the Marvel actor Sebastian Stan and Cohn by the Succession star Jeremy Strong.Trump's ex-wife Ivana Trump is played by Maria Bakalova - whose breakout role in Borat Subsequent Moviefilm landed her an Academy award nomination. There is a disclaimer at the beginning of The Apprentice indicating that portions were \"fictionalized for dramatic purposes\", Intelligencer notes.In his rant Trump described the film as \"fake and classless\". Trump said he hoped it would \"bomb\" and alleged that the was \"put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country, 'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!'\"The Apprentice has spurred praise and controversy since its premiere at the Cannes film festival in May. The screenwriter, Gabriel Sherman, described numerous roadblocks in its production.Actors were reluctant to \"humanize\" Trump, Sherman said in Vanity Fair, and Hollywood institutions did not want to fund the project. And, the most significant investor into this project allegedly threatened to kill the film after viewing it.This investor was Dan Snyder, a billionaire who formerly owned the NFL's Washington Commanders and a major Trump supporter. Snyder reportedly invested in The Apprentice through his son-in-law Mark Rapaport's film production company, Variety said.\"He was under the impression that it was a flattering portrayal of the 45th president,\" the outlet reported.The Apprentice is anything but. It contains a scene in which Trump's character appears to sexually assault his first wife, Ivana, takes amphetamines, undergoes liposuction, and receives a hair transplant.Ivana claimed that Trump raped her during a divorce deposition, but later recanted this allegation. Trump has denied attacking Ivana. Trump, who has been found liable of sexually abusing the writer E Jean Carroll in civil court, has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 20 women.Trump's lawyers sent The Apprentice's film-makers cease-and-desist letters, and prominent distributors would not go near it. \"Hollywood fashions itself as a community of truth tellers,\" Sherman said, \"but here they were running from a movie to prepare for a Trump presidency.\"In his social media attack posted just before 1am, Trump focused on the film's depiction of Ivana, who died in July 2022 after an accidental fall.\"My former wife, Ivana, was a kind and wonderful person, and I had a great relationship with her until the day she died,\" Trump wrote. \"The writer of this pile of garbage, Gabe Sherman, a lowlife and talentless hack, who has long been widely discredited, knew that, but chose to ignore it.\"So sad that HUMAN SCUM, like the people involved in this hopefully unsuccessful enterprise, are allowed to say and do whatever they want in order to hurt a Political Movement, which is far bigger than any of us. MAGA2024!\"The film's director, Ali Abbasi, seemed unbothered by Trump's Truth Social invective.\"Thanks for getting back to us @realDonaldTrump,\" Abbasi posted on X this morning, with a screenshot of his post. \"I am available to talk further if you want. Today is a tight day w a lot of press for #TheApprentice but i might be able to give you a call tomorrow.\"Asked to elaborate on Trump's statement, his campaign pointed to Sherman's comments about fictionalization in the film.\"The filmmakers now readily admit they fabricated scenes and created fake stories to fit some deranged narrative about President Trump that is completely untrue. This garbage is pure fiction which sensationalizes lies that have been long debunked,\" Steven Cheung, Trump campaign communications director, said in a statement.Cheung likened the film to purported \"witch-hunts\" by his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, saying it was \"election interference by Hollywood elites right before November, who know that President Trump will retake the White House and beat their candidate of choice because nothing they have done has worked.\"This 'film' is pure malicious defamation, should never see the light of day, and doesn't even deserve a place in the straight-to-DVD section of a bargain bin at a soon-to-be-closed discount movie store, it belongs in a dumpster fire,\" Cheung also said.",

As the time for the 2024 US Presidential election draws closer, independent candidates continue to pose fresh challenges for presidential hopefuls Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.Jill Stein of the Green Party and Chase Oliver of the Libertarian Party are polling at about 1% nationally, according to New York Times polling. Same with Chase Oliver, the Libertarian Party candidate. Although these candidates will not win, they could impact the major party candidates' chances in close states through the \"spoiler\" effect.Bernard Tamas, political science professor at Valdosta State University, said, \"This may wind up being very, very close in these key swing states.\"ALSO READ: Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett silent on backing Kamala Harris as US presidential candidate. Has Trump earned their support?Democrats are particularly concerned. Rahna Epting, executive director of MoveOn, said, \"The presidential race could very well come down to a few thousand votes in a handful of states. These third-party candidates -- they still remain a big threat this cycle.\"Democrats worry mostly about Stein. On Friday, the Democratic National Committee released ads in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, stating that \"A vote for Stein is really a vote for Trump.\" Trump has expressed support for Stein at a rally.ALSO READ: This Jupiter moon to become another Earth?In Michigan, Stein and West could pose threats to Harris.

Despite efforts to remove himself from some ballots, he remains on the ballots in Wisconsin and Michigan.Stein will appear on ballots in 38 states, including key battlegrounds. Media representatives for the Green Party did not respond for comments, but Stein claimed, \"The system is complicated by design.\"The Democratic National Committee released its first-ever television ad targeting Jill Stein as a spoiler who only benefits Donald Trump's reelection. The ad follows Stein's growing support among Arab Americans and Muslims in battleground states like Michigan, Arizona and Wisconsin where they have large populations.\"The Democrats have lost the Muslim American and the Arab American vote,\" Stein told Reuters after a rally attended by about 100 people in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn on Sunday. \"They're going to be losing enough swing states that they will not win and they cannot win.\"ALSO READ: Stunning discovery in Denmark: 50 exceptionally well preserved skeletons unearthed. Do they hint at hidden society?Jill Stein, an activist and doctor, announced her presidential run with the Green Party and previously ran for president in 2012 and 2016. Some Democrats believe her campaign in 2016 contributed to Donald Trump's victory. As a candidate, Stein promotes an \"economic bill of rights,\" including universal healthcare and the right to a job. She also advocates for climate change action, abortion access, and transgender rights.Stein recently participated in a protest in Gaza, where she was arrested. Despite her support, she is not expected to win more than 2% of the vote, which could potentially impact Vice President Kamala Harris's chances.In 2016, Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump by fewer votes than Stein received in three key states. Stein has accused Democrats of attempting to keep her off state ballots to maintain their power. Currently, she is on the ballot in at least four states, with her running mate Butch Ware, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.At a rally in June, Trump praised Stein. \"I like her very much,\" he said. \"You know why? She takes 100% from them.\"Stein argues that people often vote \"against someone they dislike\" rather than for someone they truly support.ALSO READ: Meet the most beautiful women in the world. Know the science behind their beautyChase Oliver is the Libertarian Party's candidate for president. The Libertarian Party, the third-largest political party in the US, typically draws voters who favor smaller government and more individual freedom. Oliver, a 40-year-old sales executive from Georgia, previously ran for Congress.Oliver argues that voters no longer want to choose \"the lesser of two evils.\" His campaign platform includes balancing the federal budget, ending military support to Israel and Ukraine, closing US military bases overseas, and abolishing the death penalty.Libertarian candidates generally secure 1-3% of the vote, mainly drawing support from Republicans. In the 2020 presidential election, the Libertarian candidate's votes in three key battleground states outnumbered the margin by which Donald Trump lost those states. If those votes had gone to Trump, he might have won those states and potentially altered the overall election outcome.Wisconsin has a particularly crowded ballot. In addition to Trump and Harris, voters will be able to choose among Stein and Oliver; Cornel West, a theologian and independent candidate; Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the former independent candidate who now backs Trump; Randall Terry, the nominee for the Constitution Party; and Claudia De la Cruz, the nominee for the Party for Socialism and Liberation.Julia Azari, political science professor at Marquette University, said, \"Any story we try to tell about that will be based on assumptions about what candidate they might have preferred as a second choice.\"Democrats have also targeted outside candidates by challenging ballot applications with mixed results. Epting mentioned they are now focused on direct voter outreach, saying, \"The more we engage the voters, especially hard-to-reach voters on this election, and talk to them about Kamala Harris' agenda for this country, that is an incredibly effective strategy.\"Additionally, Democrats have accused Republican operatives of assisting outsider candidates like West. Edwin DeJesus of the West campaign denied these allegations.",

    "title": "Capitalism, Crisis, and the 2024 Election | Common Dreams",
    "content": "This is the second-ever presidential election as conscious adults for many young folks. I remember during my first, in 2020, I was freshly 18 and brimming with an almost egoistic confidence in my decision to abstain from voting. I did not have faith in either the Democratic Party or their nominee, Joe Biden, to represent me.Four years later, my view of the Democratic Party has only worsened, especially as Palestinian blood continues to spill by their hands. And yet, at the same time, the threat of fascism from the Republican Party is becoming ever more real. The far-right has intensified its attacks on the bodily autonomy of women, the LGTBQ community, and on the rotting carcass that is American Democracy. Now that I am 22, and in stark contrast to my past self, this election leaves me writhing in a pool of self-doubt. The same question repeats over and over in my head: Can I really sit this one out?It is within this tension that I found myself sitting down with three next-system thinkers about the upcoming election. These activists and scholars have dedicated their lives to challenging systemic poverty and economic injustice through decades of combined experience in grassroots organizing in the United States. Our discussion touched not only on the significance of the 2024 election but the increasingly acute political crisis in the United States and the current prospects for system change.We're living globally in a period of a profound economic crisis and environmental catastrophe.What I learned, in some ways, reflected my own ambivalence. They too were divided on the question that Bill Fletcher described in our interview as \"the politics of moral outrage versus the politics of power.\" As Cheri Honkala shared with me, it is important that Americans vote their conscience in the face of a genocide carried out in Palestine by the Democratic Party. However, Stephanie Luce offered an opposing perspective, urging the left to \"get realistic about our power\" in the context of an increasingly emboldened, fascistic right wing. Ultimately, what these contrasting tendencies represent is an ongoing historical debate between two different philosophies for the American left.These interviews have been edited for brevity and clarity.Q: There seems to be a general sense that, regardless of who wins the 2024 presidential election, the system as a whole -- the social, ecological, economic, and political system of which we are all a part -- has some very serious issues. What systemic problems do you see today and how serious are they?Cheri Honkola: Our capitalist system has created a situation where people just can't live... People have absolutely no rights to land, no rights to free speech, and no rights to live anywhere. And there's a serious increasing criminalization just of being poor and just of being homeless in this country. People just can't live right now, so people are being forced to set up co-ops and a cooperative economy and all of those kinds of things. And the approach, I think, for folks that are on the absolute bottom, it's a little different. There's a growing equality of misery; we're very clear that there's going to be no utopia under capitalism.Bill Fletcher Jr.: We're living globally in a period of a profound economic crisis and environmental catastrophe, and this convergence runs us into the equivalent of two tectonic plates that are crashing against one another. And in that situation, you have mountains that are built, and you have earthquakes, and we're seeing both, and so this is creating great instability and anxiety.In the United States, in part as a reflection of that, we're living through a cold Civil War. And this cold Civil War really became very evident with Newt Gingrich and the Contract With America, there were clear signs of counterattack against the victories that had been won in the 20th century. Now since then, key elements in the Republican establishment have made use of mass movements on the right that have been developing since the late 60s and have thought that they could manipulate them, but instead, what they've done is follow the course of Dr. Frankenstein in creating a monster that they can't control, and that's why the MAGA movement smacked out of the way the opponents to former U.S. President Donald Trump both in 2016 and this year. So, it's a very dangerous situation, and the danger's compounded by an armed wing of the right-wing authoritarian movement, plus the recklessness of very wealthy men, so it creates a very unstable situation.If we go down a path of authoritarian rule, I don't see any hope for addressing a more functioning economy or a more sustainable climate situation that's going to protect the most impacted.Stephanie Luce: Well, I think it's multidimensional. The crises are from a number of angles. Some of the most pressing issues are certainly related to climate. There is really no way of turning back, so our choices are to slow down the worst of it and mitigate the worst impacts. But in any case, it seems, we're already in it, and a lot of people are already experiencing a climate crisis, and then certainly, there are growing threats to democracy around the world, of people even electing authoritarian leaders and losing faith in democracy. And I would say the U.S. certainly has never had a real democracy even to begin with. So, it's not like I'm romanticizing what came before, but it is possible that even that can go backwards, instead of forwards, in terms of creating a real multiracial democracy. And then how we think about the economy, there are a lot of measures that would suggest things are relatively stable right now, but underneath it is certainly not a sustainable system, it's an economy that's producing for profit instead of human need and producing for growth instead of sustainability. So, I would say those are the underlying crises that will be there no matter what the outcome of the election is.Q: Given what you just shared, what kinds of changes to the system do you see as absolutely necessary? And what changes do you think are opening up that you are really excited about?Cheri: One of the things I see is that this growing equality of misery is a different form of unity that is developing. The ruling class has really figured out how to keep us divided in regard to gender, race, and all of these other kinds of things. And I think that the positive side of the negative is that it's forcing us to figure out how to work together to create something very different in order to stay alive.One of the closest people I work with is an African American male who was formerly homeless and incarcerated, served some time in the military, has seven kids, and is married. There's no way we would have been working together for 30 years just because he's a nice guy. We have nothing in common. But we've had to figure out ways to work together. People need each other desperately in order to stay alive.For us, it's really about organizing. To literally take back land, organize to take back food, working together to demand the other half of the operation for a kid's mouth, and that's why we've just recently written this book Takeover. It's a little bit of our history, but it's also a manual on teaching homeless people across this country how to house themselves in abandoned government homes that are vacant because there are more abandoned properties than there are homeless people. And I think that the other positive thing is that there's so much surplus right now that it really is a question of redistribution and getting organized to take back our human rights.We have to create a block that's capable of winning and introducing substantive, structural changes.Bill: Well, the system itself is a rock, so I start there. Capitalism is antithetical to the future of humanity. Now, on top of that, the U.S. sociopolitical system that's based on or built upon, capitalism is itself rigged against people of color, women, against working-class people. And one of the things about the way it's rigged, particularly when it comes to people of color, is that when we try to play by the rules, the rules get changed. We see this in elections by different things that the Republicans have been doing in terms of voter suppression. You see this in the economy and business. The demand needs to be for consistent democracy, an expansion of democracy into all spheres, not a retraction or a retrenchment, and so we need to make it easier for people to vote, not more difficult. We need to make it easier for workers to form unions, not more difficult. We need to make it easier for women to control their own bodies, not more difficult. We need to make it easier for LGBTQ folks to live their lives in harmony and not more difficult. We need to be addressing the fact that the planet is burning rather than ignoring it. Those are the kinds of things that we need to be doing, and those are the changes that need to be introduced and that we need to demand of our political leaders.Stephanie: Well for me, in a sense, the building of a multiracial democracy is an outcome and a way to address the other two. I don't see how if we go down a path of authoritarian rule, I don't see any hope for addressing a more functioning economy or a more sustainable climate situation that's going to protect the most impacted. So I guess for me, some of my effort has been focusing on deepening and expanding and making democracy real, because I feel like that's one of our only hopes for addressing those other serious crises.I think it's a strange moment of kind of real highs and lows. So, I have been involved myself in a number of efforts to engage more people in this fight around democracy, acknowledging, again, like I said, the ways in which it has failed many of us up until now. It's not about just saying, let's revive the status quo or what's done been before, but can we deepen it and make it more real, whether it's in the workplace, through having a voice at work and even thinking about worker control, whether it's in our communities, and thinking about what it would look like if we had people who are most impacted making real decisions about things like housing and transportation.Some of the training and discussion about what democracy could look like, the ways in which it's failed us, and the historic role that working people have played in fighting off authoritarian governments, I think that's interesting. There are people definitely worried about that and engaged in that. My other arena is particularly around worker organizing, just tons of interest. I've never seen this level of interest in the entire time I've worked on this, particularly among young people, about how it's not just about fighting for things, like a union that's important, but like, really questioning, why do we even work at all? What is it for? What's the purpose of work, and who makes the decisions about how the economy runs?Q: Staying on the theme of new possibilities: What kinds of new combinations do you see as possible -- unusual allies, new ways of coming together, new sets of approaches -- in the 2020s that may have been more difficult to achieve in the past?Cheri: Well, there really is this thing that we call a growing, developing new class. And so that's like a nurse friend of mine that just figured she was going to be a nurse the rest of her life and everything would be great. And now she's an older woman, and she couldn't figure out the technology, and so she was replaced by a bunch of younger people that are going into nursing that were born and raised with computers. Or it's the person that has worked someplace, and they've totally eliminated that industry that used to pay enough so you could have a two-car garage or thought that they were going to be great for the rest of their life because they worked at a union and paid union dues their whole life, and then they close down that shop. These are the new people that are coming to the bottom and that we're working together with, and that's a huge fall. And these are people who really believe that they have an entitlement.You know capitalism has really done a job on poor people period, to have them believe that they don't really deserve any of these things, and they don't have rights, and they've been individual failures, and it's not a part of a larger system. And I think that that's harder to buy when you're part of this growing new class of people that are becoming expendable.Bill: We have been witnessing the rise of new and renovated social movements. We have not yet built a conscious majoritarian block that can win power. That's what we need to do. We need to first block or stop MAGA, but stopping MAGA is not enough. We have to create a block that's capable of winning and introducing substantive, structural changes.I think that the two corporate political parties in this country are going to fight like hell to remain relevant.So, I'm not sure that there are any new combinations as such. It's more about making the combinations more conscious and standing up against ethno-nationalism and identity-exclusive politics.Stephanie: On the one hand, there are a lot of young people, and not just only young people, but a lot of energy from young people looking to rebuild an internationalist movement particularly focused on Gaza, but that brings people to renew their interest in learning about other parts of the world, and we do have more tools to communicate across borders and talk to and learn from activists across the globe. So that's a positive place for me. I also think there are a number of issues that are really contentious, but actually kind of divide our political parties or divide our coalitions. I think immigration is one, for example, it tends to be portrayed as if there's a Republican position and a Democratic position. I don't actually think that's true.I think there's actually a lot of division within the Democratic Party and also division within the Republican Party, because a lot of people who are truly Christian or religious have a belief in rights. Employers, for example, have historically been wanting to embrace immigrants and bring more immigrants to the country. So, there's these issues that divide the coalitions as they stand and could make space for reconfiguration of new alliances, certainly also around things like healthcare, that crosses party lines. And it's more about 1% versus 99% -- and climate as well, I think climate is another area of possibly renewed alliances, and some of that's generational, but it's also about some people's values that that they hold and it's like, Okay, actually, the parties aren't speaking for these values.Q: It looks like system change is coming whether we like it or not. There are endless possibilities for what the next system might look like, good and bad. What do you see as the organizing and movement building challenges that absolutely must be overcome in order to build a better world?Cheri: I think we're in an in-between stage right now, and those who are already facing fascism are terrified and having to confront that. That's immigrants in this country, and people that are already living behind bars. And neighborhoods like Kensington are already dealing with a system where the government and the police there and the politicians are all working together, and where they have mobile jails, and there is no due process, and there is no media covering our day-to-day reality. Like in Kensington and other areas of the country, they want absolute control, there already has been a genocide of different sections of the population with the fentanyl crisis, and more people have died now from fentanyl than died during the Vietnam War. And that is crippling people and killing people, and nothing is being done about it.I think that the two corporate political parties in this country are going to fight like hell to remain relevant. They will buy or offer cabinet positions or large amounts of resources for their organizations to divert the population from system change and keep them in some kind of reform. Have the people's leaders take them in the direction of reform. So, what you see happening now in this country is the immense threat of anybody that's talking about the creation of a different kind of system, versus getting on the bandwagon for Kamala Harris. I have so many Democrat bots on my social media. It's like a full-time job for them. I'm old enough to remember back in the day when there was a real anti-war movement in this country, and you would never think of any civil rights organizations not being involved. There are so many people who are in the financial pockets right now of the Democratic Party for their places of faith. While, literally, children are being slaughtered and the genocide is going on in Gaza; it's just devastating.Internally, I think we need to really up our internal training about long-term strategy and be realistic about our power.Bill: One of the big dangers is purism. We see it in the electoral realm all the time, and it's the idea that if a politician does not have exactly my platform, they are a sellout and not worthy of support. It's also reflective of the politics of moral outrage versus the politics of power. So, the politics of moral outrage are represented by \"we are furious about this, that, or whatever, and therefore we're not going to vote for this candidate, or we're not going to vote at all.\" And that view is objectively apocalyptic. Basically, it means that no change can come about until there's a total collapse. And some people believe that you have this kind of pure streak that is waiting. I often analogize it to a surfer who paddles out into the ocean waiting for the ideal wave, believing that once they get it, they can ride it straight into shore. And that's not politics. That's something else. Sectarianism is related. It's sort of the notion that it's my way or the highway.Mountain Stronghold Mentality is something that Bill Gallegos and I have written about, and it's a notion that comes from an era in the Chinese Revolution when there were guerrilla bands that were literally on mountaintops that would be their base area. They'd come down and attack the enemy and then go back to the base areas. The revolution shifted, and they needed mobile units to engage the enemy in a different way. Many of the guerrilla commanders didn't want to come down from mountaintops, because they were comfortable. They were secure. They didn't believe that they could be captured or destroyed by the enemy, and so they basically, despite the change in conditions, sought comfort. We see this with organizations that are afraid to take risks and to unite with others because they're comfortable where they are.Another problem is the lack of strategy and strategic thinking. We progressives are very used to fighting defensive battles when we have difficulty thinking offensively. So, I'll give you an example. I often use this example. A number of years ago, maybe 10 years ago, I was in Texas on a speaking engagement, and it was before  Abbott was elected governor. And so, I was giving a talk about something, and during the Q and A, people were telling me how bad the situation was in Texas. So, I listened. They wanted to know what I thought needed to be done. And I said, How do we take over Texas? They took a deep breath, sat back, couldn't figure out what I was thinking, whether I had lost my mind, and I said to them, look, you've told me how bad the situation is. I get it. We have two alternatives. One, we can give up, go off, and get high, right? The other is that we develop a strategy to win. And the strategy to win needs to look at everything, from which are the key cities in Texas, which are the key counties, which are the counties that we can afford to ignore? What are the social movements that are in operation? Who are the key opinion makers? Where can resources be obtained? All of these things. And then read a little bit of Sun Tzu, you know The Art of War, and think strategically about how we win.Stephanie: Oh, there's so many. Yeah. I mean, this is a long list, but for me, I sometimes think about it as, what do we need to do internally, within our organizations and movements? I think we need to think about that. And then there's the set of external challenges. And so internally, I think we need to really up our internal training about long-term strategy and be realistic about our power. A lot of us don't have power, and instead, we tend to look for a moral stance like, what's the right thing to do? That's important, but if it doesn't come with building power, then it's not a strategy. I worked on this book called Practical Radicals because people have tended to be either radicals with big dreams and visions but with no plan to win, or very pragmatic and with a small, winnable goal, but it's too small to really change much. So, I think as organizations and movements, we have to really get better trained on how to do long-term strategy, and that includes also getting better about how to work in alliance with one another across our organizations and sectors where we don't agree on everything. People in the climate movement might not share the same goals and visions as some people in labor unions, for example, but we have to find those common-ground ways in which we're all better off. We're stronger together than we are apart.And then I think the external challenges are massive. Because the U.S. state is well armed and powerful. The police state is massive. People will be deported, shot at, arrested. So, we have to be realistic about the powers that we are up against, not just in the United States, but globally. And really also get strategic about how to divide that ruling coalition. They don't all benefit from it, or they benefit unequally, and that means that we need to think about peeling off certain segments of that. That means working with people we really don't like and whom we disagree with on a lot of things, but we might share common end goals, such as climate sustainability or defending democracy as a system. So those external threats are real, and we just don't have the power on our own to really make those kinds of changes.",

Many include language in effect blaming Iran for the 10/7 attacks. Some explicitly or implicitly frame the Hamas attack as an attack on the Jewish people (as opposed to on Israel/Israelis). Many include support for Israel's war on Gaza, its war on Lebanon, and its impending attack on Iran. Many talk about the imperative for the US to stand with Israel until \"victory\" Many talk about Israeli hostages and the imperative to save them, notwithstanding the fact that the Israeli government appears to have long ago written them off as necessary collateral damage in its war on Gaza. A very small number mention Palestinian suffering and casualties, or anything about restraint, de-escalation, ceasefire, concern over regional war, or criticize the Israeli govt, etc.... Some use the anniversary to double down on conflating protest of Israel/Zionism/Israel's actions post-Oct 7, especially on US campuses, with antisemitism and vowed to shut down such protests.

That may have delayed the ability of the producers to obtain a distributor, but once they did, Trump and his team have yet to file any litigation.The Apprentice tells of the early days of Trump in 1970s and 80s Manhattan, where Roy Cohn teaches his \"apprentice\" how to fight back against a federal lawsuit alleging that Trump and his father engaged in discrimination against Black applicants seeking to rent housing from them.The most objectionable scene appears to be one where Trump (Sebastian Stan) sexually assaults his then-wife Ivana. The scene is based on one of Ivana Trump's depositions, which she later said was made during a period of \"high tension\" during their divorce proceedings and \"totally without merit\".Trump wrote, \"A FAKE and CLASSLESS Movie written about me, called, The Apprentice (Do they even have the right to use that name without approval?), will hopefully \"bomb.\" It's a cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country, 'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!'\"The Apprentice opened to a lackluster $1.58 million at the box office over the weekend.One of the figures portrayed in the movie -- Roger Stone, a longtime Trump ally who helped steer him to a career in politics -- actually praised the portrayals.",

    "title": "A devastating hurricane doesn't dramatically change how people vote - but in a close election, it can matter",
    "content": "North Carolina and Florida are changing administrative rules and, in some cases, issuing emergency funding that is intended to make it easier for people in areas damaged by Hurricanes Helene and Milton to vote.The recovery in both states is expected to extend far beyond the November 2024 election period. The majority of the people in the affected communities in North Carolina and Florida voted for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in 2020, making some election analysts wonder if some Trump supporters will be able to cast their ballots.Amy Lieberman, a politics and society editor at The Conversation U.S., spoke with Boris Heersink, a scholar of voters' behavior after a natural disaster, to better understand if and how the recent hurricanes could shift the results of the 2024 presidential election.A massive hurricane disrupts people's lives in many important ways, including affecting people's personal safety and where they can live. Ahead of an election, there are a lot of practical limitations about how an election can be executed - like if a person can still receive mail-in ballots at home or elsewhere, or if it is possible to still vote in person at their polling location if that building was destroyed or damaged.Another issue is whether people who have just lived through a natural disaster and will likely be dealing with the aftermath for weeks to come are focused on politics right now. Some might sit out the election because they simply have more important things to worry about.The other side of the equation, which is what political scientists like myself are mostly focusing on, is whether people take the fact that a natural disaster happened into consideration when they vote.Two scholars, Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels, have argued that sometimes voters are not great at figuring out how to incorporate bad things that happened to them into a voting position. In some cases, it is entirely fair to hold an elected official responsible for bad outcomes that affect people's lives. But at other moments, bad things can happen to us without that being the fault of an incumbent president or governor. And voters should ideally be able to balance out these different types of bad things - those it is fair to punish elected officials for, and those for which it isn't fair to hold them responsible.After all, a devastating hurricane is terrible, but it is not Kamala Harris' fault that it happened. But Achen and Bartels argue that voters frequently still punish elected officials for random bad events like this.Their most famous example is the consequences of a series of shark attacks off the New Jersey coast in the summer of 1916. As a result of those attacks, the New Jersey tourism industry saw a major decline. While these findings are still being debated, Achen and Bartels argue that Jersey shore voters subsequently voted against Woodrow Wilson in the 1916 presidential election at a higher rate than they would have had the shark attacks not happened. They argue that voters did this even though Wilson had no involvement in the shark attacks.Scholars like John Gasper and Andrew Reeves argue that voters mostly care whether elected officials respond appropriately to a disaster. So, if the president does a good job reacting, voters do not actually punish them at all in the next election. However, voters can punish elected officials if they feel like the response is not correct.The fact that Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana in 2005 was not the fault of then-President George W. Bush. But the perceived slowness of the government response is something a voter could have held him responsible for.Colleagues and I have shown that how people interpret the combination of a disaster and the government response is likely colored by their own partisanship.We looked at both the effects of Superstorm Sandy on the 2012 presidential election and natural disasters' impact on elections more broadly from 1972 through 2004. One core finding is that when presidents reject state officials' disaster declaration requests, they lose votes in affected counties - but only if those counties were already more supportive of the opposite party.If there is a strong positive government response, the incumbent president or their party can actually gain votes or lose voters affected by a disaster. So, Republicans affected by the hurricanes could become more inclined to vote against Harris if they feel like they are not getting the help they need. But it could also help Harris if affected Democrats feel like they are getting enough aid.The major takeaway is that if the government responds really effectively to a natural disaster or other emergency, there is not a huge electoral penalty - and there could even be a small reward.That is not irrelevant in a close election. If Republicans in affected areas in North Carolina feel the government response has been poor and it inspires them to turn out in higher numbers to punish Harris, that could matter. But if they feel like the response has been adequate, research suggests either no real effect on their support for Harris - or possibly even an increase in Harris voters.Scholars mostly assume that people affected can tell whether the government response was good or not. Trump and other Republicans are falsely saying that the response is slow and falsely claiming that Federal Emergency Management Agency money is being spent on immigrants who are not living in the country legally. There does not appear to be a slow government response to the hurricane in North Carolina, and there's no evidence the response is insufficient in Florida, either.So, the question now is whether voters affected by these hurricanes will respond based on their actual lived experiences, or how they are told they are living their experience.This article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and trustworthy analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.

    "title": "Carrasquillo: Kamala is 'brat'",
    "content": "Opinion: \"Brat summer\" has officially affected us, and it's a very important (political) matter. Whether you're a Charli XCX stan or voting blue this November, here's why it carries importance.A diverse electorate of nearly 41 million \"young voters,\" according t0 Tufts University, will shape the 2024 presidential election this year. This is electrifying news for the Democratic Party, which has recently stirred the pot with President Biden's drop from the race and the Democratic Party nominating current Vice President Kamala Harris for president.A recent study conducted by SSRS for CNN found that nearly 75% of voters in the United States believed the Democratic Party would have a better chance at winning the presidency in 2024 with someone other than Joe Biden at the forefront of the ballot.Harris is nipping at former President Trump's heels in a hypothetical showdown. Trump is polling at 46% among registered voters while Harris is at 49% according to a New York Times poll from Oct. 11, which means an Olympic contest on our hands as we advance closer to the 2024 election.Harris's edge over Trump is fueled largely by a surge in support from women. Polling data reveals that 50% of female voters prefer Harris over Trump when compared to 44% who favored Biden over the same combatant, suggesting a photo finish come November. When University of Oregon students were approached on the matter, the prospect of a female president held great allure.\"The appeal that a woman can be anything she wants to be. That is what 'brat' means to me.\" UO journalism master's candidate Saida Guzman said. This year's election might be one of the most important elections to date. At least, for the sake of democracy.\"A woman can do whatever the fuck a man can do, and can probably do it better. Not only a woman but a woman of color. That would be so phenomenal,\" UO student Abby Snethen said when asked about the potential of a female candidate claiming this year's election.When it comes to issues about human rights, climate change and solving economic inequality, Harris's plentiful progressive priorities are held in high esteem by the Gen Z demographic.\"Her influence now on social media is not like we've seen before. It's a unique approach and is definitely helpful,\" Guzman said.At 59 years young, Harris appeals to UO students as a highly receptive lead for defending the values of tomorrow through her leadership today. Certainly, her social media appeal can only bolster these positive reactions for her campaign.Her personal story of resilience and diversity offers a refreshing, unapologetic narrative that compels a generation to continue the fight for equal representation in the most salient matters of today's political agenda.But, the question remains: can she convert TikTok likes and internet fame into actionable change? I'd say the answer is a resounding \"yes.\" Harris's youthful, bubbly, spirited campaign trail online has active Democratic supporters gushing over the idea of a \"Femininomenon\" era of politics.On X, TikTok and Instagram, her popularity has flourished, cultivating a deeper presence about just how special it is to be a woman in a position of power. Further data from the University of Georgia concludes Harris' suggestive take is outnumbering Trump's Twitter finger days, concluding that her internet fame may take her places further than a few X followers.The iconic neon \"brat\" meme might just give her the green light to a president-elect position, garnering publicity on all platforms as it coincides with all the right moves that the Biden-Harris administration has made surrounding lowered prescription drug costs, veteran healthcare services and modernized infrastructure initiatives.It's to be decided if the stars align in November in the same way they propelled Harris into the Gen Z quick-switch gaze, but we'll stay resharing her image with fellow digital nomads in high hopes.The epic crossover between Madam Vice President and artists such as Charli XCX and Chappell Roan is one for the history books -- and the culture. While her internet campaign continues to reach new heights, it's imperative to understand the raw influence Harris imposes on Gen Z cyber-dwellers, beyond the context of all in which we live.",

The election, featuring Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, presents a unique scenario for the cryptocurrency market.What Happened: Despite the election's proximity, the crypto market remains stable. Bitcoin's price has fluctuated between $55,000 and $65,000 over the past three months, marking a modest 6% increase. This stability follows a spike in July when Trump was shot at a rally, boosting his election prospects, and President Joe Biden subsequently withdrew, endorsing Harris, Barron's reported on Monday.Brett Reeves from BitGo believes Harris's candidacy has balanced the crypto market. Meanwhile, Gregory Benhaim from 3iQ predicts a Trump win could temporarily boost Bitcoin prices, though legislative challenges might arise without a Republican Congress majority. Conversely, Harris's victory could lead to a more volatile market, despite her recent support for crypto as a future industry.See Also: Gary Gensler Doubts Cryptocurrency Future, Says Leading Figures Are Either In Jail Or Awaiting ExtraditionBenhaim views the election as a long-term win for Bitcoin, given neither candidate plans to address the U.S. debt, enhancing Bitcoin's appeal over fiat currency.\"I'm really not looking at this election as a make-or-break moment for Bitcoin or digital assets as a whole,\" he said.Why It Matters: Trump recently announced the launch of a token sale for his decentralized finance project, World Liberty Financial, emphasizing his commitment to the crypto space.Analysts from Bernstein suggest that a Trump victory could propel Bitcoin to new highs, potentially reaching $80,000 to $90,000.

    "content": "This week's Future of Work newsletter examines how leaders can navigate the divisiveness of election season, interviews Indeed's CEO about the job market and dives into news about the workforce.This is the published version of Forbes' Future of Work newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief human resources officers and other talent managers on disruptive technologies, managing the workforce and trends in the remote work debate. Click here to get it delivered to your inbox every Monday!he 2024 presidential election is just 22 days away. And we all know what that means: More divisive conversations in the hallways, questions about rights and privileges when it comes to free speech at work, and yet another reason many workers don't want to come back to the office. An Owl Labs survey of 2,000 full-time U.S. workers found that 45% said their employers' or colleagues' political opinions have made them not want to go to the office.As is common at this point in an election year, we'll hear plenty of advice for how executive leaders can manage the run-up to November 5: from helping employees develop civil discourse skills, to navigating the polarization around DEI and facilitating productive conflict. But one issue has gotten less attention: how to deal with the day after.Depending on the makeup of your workforce, half or more may be unhappy with the election results -- that is, if we have results the following day -- and being in the office around others could present some challenges. Contributor Bryan Robinson suggests employers should honor work-from-home requests that day, giving people space to choose where they'll be able to do their best work.At the very least, we hope everyone is encouraging workers to vote -- and giving them time off to do so. HR Executive cites a survey from workforce data provider Brightmine which found that even though 31 states have policies mandating workers get time off to vote, less than a third of workers say their employer offers voting-leave policies, and only 28% of the 2,000 Americans surveyed have used voting time off to cast a ballot in an election.Boeing said last week it has withdrawn a pay raise offer made to its striking factory workers after negotiations between both sides fell apart, extending a major work stoppage. Stephanie Pope, the president and CEO of Boeing's Commercial Airplanes division, said the plane maker \"bargained in good faith\" and offered \"increases in take-home pay and retirement,\" while the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) -- which represents the 33,000 striking workers -- issued its own statement, saying Boeing was \"hell-bent on standing on the non-negotiated offer.\" Then Friday, the aerospace firm announced it would cut 10% of its workforce in the coming months, or about 17,000 jobs, including executives and managers.Kate Ryder, founder and CEO of women's health startup Maven Clinic, is trying to disrupt the current cost model of infertility care by offering employers a payment platform that charges a flat fee to route women through the journey that's best for them. \"We just charge one fixed fee, which means that we can really sit there with the patient and try to understand what's best for her based on her medical history, her financial situation, and what she wants,\" Ryder told Forbes' Maggie McGrath. Last week, Maven Clinic raised a $125 million Series F round led by StepStone Group at a $1.7 billion valuation. Check out \nFormer President Donald Trump said last week he supports the end of \"double taxation\" for Americans who live overseas, according to multiple outlets, marking his latest tax cut proposal in the leadup to the election. The change to the tax code could specifically unburden higher income Americans with investments who pay taxes for both the U.S. and the place where they reside.Amid the ongoing furor over remote and hybrid work, two surveys show how much employers want people back -- and that employees don't want to follow the mandates. HR Dive published a survey by Robert Half in June finding that two out of three managers said they would be willing to increase salaries for new hires who work in an office. Meanwhile another survey from Resume Builder found that one in five workers say they aren't following their company's mandate, with about half saying they'll quit if their company enforces RTO compliance.Amid softer hiring, AI's impact and surprising news about recent jobs numbers that shattered economists' estimates -- Forbes spoke with Indeed CEO Chris Hyams about what he's seeing in the job market, the platform's evolving business and how AI is changing the experience for recruiters and candidates. Excerpts from our conversation have been edited for length and clarity.As we look ahead to the end of the year, what are you seeing in terms of the number of job postings?It is very clear, thematically, looking at our data, that demand has been softening. Still, macro,  above pre-pandemic. We baseline everything to February of 2020. We are, as of last week, I think about 11 or 12% above pre-pandemic levels across the board. It was still a tight hiring market pre-pandemic.However, it is a tale of multiple sectors here. ... If we look at the peak -- a year and a half, two years ago -- overall, we were about 60% above pre-pandemic levels for the entire U.S. market. So the fact that we're down 11 and 12% above pre-pandemic means we're down considerably.At the same time, quit rates are down. Churn has come down. When we look at labor force participation, that is actually up, which we think is a good thing. ... There are more people coming into the market and they're going directly onto the unemployment rolls. The way we think of it at a high level is the labor market is strong enough to be attracting people back into it, but not strong enough currently to be placing them all.How much of that is economic issues and hiring versus AI?We are looking very carefully trying to see where we can prove AI is having this impact on jobs. We have not yet -- and we have a lot of very smart people looking at this -- seen here is a specific instance of \"this job looks like it is going away.\"It's not 100% perfect, but it's highly correlated that the areas where AI is more likely to have a higher impact -- those job listings are lower than their peak, relatively speaking, to the more in-person . I can't say how much of that is because of boom and bust, or how much of that is the availability of work being able to be done remotely, .However, in my own assessment ... a job opening is a forward looking assessment of what kind of labor I'm going to need in the future. AI does not have to actually replace any jobs for someone to think I might need less  in the future. I suspect what we are starting to see is people thinking I am less likely to need more people as opposed to AI being capable of doing that person's job.How is AI impacting the job search process?Our focus for the platform is we want to ensure that every job has a human being on the other side who is actually responsive and looking at applications as they come in and every person who's applying to jobs is a human being who's actually seen that job.What we're trying to do is use AI on our side to help people find things that are the best fit for them. So instead of going the other direction, applying to 100 jobs a day, you might apply to one or two of exactly the right jobs where you have a pretty good sense that you're a good fit.How is your business changing?We started out really as a search engine and we aggregated all the jobs and people came and they searched but then they clicked and they left and went somewhere else. When we do that, it's actually very hard to control for quality. ... So what we've been doing for much of the last 20 years is moving from being just a pure search engine to a real two sided marketplace. The more people engage on the platform, the more dramatic the results. Part of that is going from a quantity to quality focus.Search used to be the way job seekers found jobs on Indeed. Today, 60% of all of the paid connections that happen on the platform happen through recommendations. So a job seeker will come and search, but the vast majority of the jobs that they're seeing are ones that we are recommending to them.A recent report from Gallup found that even though 93% of Fortune 500 CHROs say their organization has begun using AI tools and technologies to improve business practices, most workers remain unaware of these efforts. The second quarter survey was conducted in May with a random sample of 21,543 working adults who are members of the Gallup Panel.33%: Only a third of all U.S. employees say their organization has begun integrating AI into their business practices, Gallup's survey found, with the highest percentage in white-collar industries (44%). That's lower than other surveys from tech firms like Microsoft, which reported in May that 75% of full-time office workers surveyed said they're now using AI at work.67%: The percentage of employees who said they never use artificial intelligence in their roles, Gallup found in its survey.\"Weekly use remains limited, and many employees never use AI,\" Kate Den Houter wrote in a summary of the survey. \"Despite leaders prioritizing AI adoption and using AI tools themselves, most employees are not.\"Atlassian's president talks about collaborative cultures, AI and CEO transitionsThe best ways leaders can champion employee mental healthGrow your emotional intelligence with these three science-backed strategies.The Secure Act 2.0 allows companies to offer 401(k) contributions to workers who are actively making student loan payments -- even if those employees are not contributing to their retirement accounts themselves.

    "title": "A devastating hurricane doesn't dramatically change how people vote - but in a close election, it can matter",
    "content": "(The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.)Boris Heersink, Fordham University(THE CONVERSATION) North Carolina and Florida are changing administrative rules and, in some cases, issuing emergency funding that is intended to make it easier for people in areas damaged by Hurricanes Helene and Milton to vote.The recovery in both states is expected to extend far beyond the November 2024 election period. The majority of the people in the affected communities in North Carolina and Florida voted for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in 2020, making some election analysts wonder if some Trump supporters will be able to cast their ballots.Amy Lieberman, a politics and society editor at The Conversation U.S., spoke with Boris Heersink, a scholar of voters' behavior after a natural disaster, to better understand if and how the recent hurricanes could shift the results of the 2024 presidential election.How can hurricanes create complications ahead of an election?A massive hurricane disrupts people's lives in many important ways, including affecting people's personal safety and where they can live. Ahead of an election, there are a lot of practical limitations about how an election can be executed - like if a person can still receive mail-in ballots at home or elsewhere, or if it is possible to still vote in person at their polling location if that building was destroyed or damaged.Another issue is whether people who have just lived through a natural disaster and will likely be dealing with the aftermath for weeks to come are focused on politics right now. Some might sit out the election because they simply have more important things to worry about.Beyond practical concerns, how else can a natural disaster influence an election?The other side of the equation, which is what political scientists like myself are mostly focusing on, is whether people take the fact that a natural disaster happened into consideration when they vote.Two scholars, Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels, have argued that sometimes voters are not great at figuring out how to incorporate bad things that happened to them into a voting position. In some cases, it is entirely fair to hold an elected official responsible for bad outcomes that affect people's lives. But at other moments, bad things can happen to us without that being the fault of an incumbent president or governor. And voters should ideally be able to balance out these different types of bad things - those it is fair to punish elected officials for, and those for which it isn't fair to hold them responsible.After all, a devastating hurricane is terrible, but it is not Kamala Harris' fault that it happened. But Achen and Bartels argue that voters frequently still punish elected officials for random bad events like this.Their most famous example is the consequences of a series of shark attacks off the New Jersey coast in the summer of 1916. As a result of those attacks, the New Jersey tourism industry saw a major decline. While these findings are still being debated, Achen and Bartels argue that Jersey shore voters subsequently voted against Woodrow Wilson in the 1916 presidential election at a higher rate than they would have had the shark attacks not happened. They argue that voters did this even though Wilson had no involvement in the shark attacks.How else do voters consider bad events when they vote?Scholars like John Gasper and Andrew Reeves argue that voters mostly care whether elected officials respond appropriately to a disaster. So, if the president does a good job reacting, voters do not actually punish them at all in the next election. However, voters can punish elected officials if they feel like the response is not correct.The fact that Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana in 2005 was not the fault of then-President George W. Bush. But the perceived slowness of the government response is something a voter could have held him responsible for.How do voters' political affiliations affect where and how they lay the blame?Colleagues and I have shown that how people interpret the combination of a disaster and the government response is likely colored by their own partisanship.We looked at both the effects of Superstorm Sandy on the 2012 presidential election and natural disasters' impact on elections more broadly from 1972 through 2004. One core finding is that when presidents reject state officials' disaster declaration requests, they lose votes in affected counties - but only if those counties were already more supportive of the opposite party.If there is a strong positive government response, the incumbent president or their party can actually gain votes or lose voters affected by a disaster. So, Republicans affected by the hurricanes could become more inclined to vote against Harris if they feel like they are not getting the help they need. But it could also help Harris if affected Democrats feel like they are getting enough aid.The major takeaway is that if the government responds really effectively to a natural disaster or other emergency, there is not a huge electoral penalty - and there could even be a small reward.That is not irrelevant in a close election. If Republicans in affected areas in North Carolina feel the government response has been poor and it inspires them to turn out in higher numbers to punish Harris, that could matter. But if they feel like the response has been adequate, research suggests either no real effect on their support for Harris - or possibly even an increase in Harris voters.How much influence can a politician have on people assessing a government response?Scholars mostly assume that people affected can tell whether the government response was good or not. Trump and other Republicans are falsely saying that the response is slow and falsely claiming that Federal Emergency Management Agency money is being spent on immigrants who are not living in the country legally. There does not appear to be a slow government response to the hurricane in North Carolina, and there's no evidence the response is insufficient in Florida, either.So, the question now is whether voters affected by these hurricanes will respond based on their actual lived experiences, or how they are told they are living their experience.This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

    "content": "Known for his iconic portrayal of Walter White, Cranston spoke out while attending a Harris-Walz campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona.Bryan Cranston's support adds to the growing list of Hollywood figures aligning with Kamala Harris as political tensions rise ahead of the 2024 election.In an event titled \"Fighting for Reproductive Freedom,\" Saturday's gathering put the spotlight on abortion rights. The 68-year-old actor took center stage, sharing his thoughts on \"the freedom of choice,\" while emphasizing his personal connection as the father of a daughter.\"I am not a politician. I am not a doctor or a lawyer, but I played all of those on TV. But I am a father of a daughter, and it's important to me for her life now, for the future other father's daughters to be able to have within their lifetime the fundamental right, freedom of choice,\" Cranston said at the event.In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court made a historic decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, effectively upholding a Mississippi law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. This ruling struck down the constitutional protections for abortion rights that had been in place for nearly 50 years.The original 1973 Roe decision had affirmed the constitutional right to access abortion care, making this reversal a significant shift in legal precedent.\"There should not be anyone but them deciding what happens to their own bodies. And that's why I am enthusiastically supporting Vice President Harris and Governor Walz.\"The actor praised Harris's dedication to issues like freedom of choice and reproductive rights, signaling his belief in her vision for America's future.Bryan Cranston had high praise for Kamala Harris, commending her for bringing a sense of optimism back into American politics. He expressed his appreciation for \"Kamala for bringing back optimism and fighting cynicism and animosity in Washington,\" adding that he firmly believes she is the best candidate to lead the country forward.The \"Breaking Bad\" actor went on to say he has no doubt that \"she will be a terrific president,\" voicing his strong support for Harris's leadership potential.Fans' opinions on his endorsement were mixed, with one X user expressing, \"Well, Bryan Cranston, that's disappointing,\" while another praised the actor. \"Smart man ...Bryan Cranston,\" they said.Kamala Harris entered the presidential race with a strong commitment to \"restore reproductive freedom.\" Her campaign clarified that she is specifically advocating for the restoration of Roe v. Wade.According to a statement given to POLITICO, the Harris campaign reaffirmed that her stance, as expressed in a September interview on Face the Nation, remains unchanged -- she continues to support restoring Roe, which protected abortion rights up until the point of fetal viability, typically around 22 weeks of pregnancy.\"I am being precise. We need to put into law the protections of Roe v. Wade,\" Harris said at the time. \"And that is about going back to where we were before the Dobbs decision.\"Bryan Cranston has joined the long list of celebrities who have publicly endorsed Kamala Harris, including Taylor Swift, who announced her presidential pick shortly after the Donald Trump vs Kamala Harris debate last month.\"I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election,\" the \"Love Story\" singer announced. \"I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.\"\"Newsies\" star Jeremy Jordan, \"The Little Mermaid\" actress Halle Bailey, former NBA star Magic Johnson, and \"Road House\" star Sam Elliot have also publicly endorsed Kamala Harris.",

    "title": "A devastating hurricane doesn't dramatically change how people vote - but in a close election, it can matter",
    "content": "(The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.)The recovery in both states is expected to extend far beyond the November 2024 election period. The majority of the people in the affected communities in North Carolina and Florida voted for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in 2020, making some election analysts wonder if some Trump supporters will be able to cast their ballots.Amy Lieberman, a politics and society editor at The Conversation U.S., spoke with Boris Heersink, a scholar of voters' behavior after a natural disaster, to better understand if and how the recent hurricanes could shift the results of the 2024 presidential election.How can hurricanes create complications ahead of an election?A massive hurricane disrupts people's lives in many important ways, including affecting people's personal safety and where they can live. Ahead of an election, there are a lot of practical limitations about how an election can be executed - like if a person can still receive mail-in ballots at home or elsewhere, or if it is possible to still vote in person at their polling location if that building was destroyed or damaged.Another issue is whether people who have just lived through a natural disaster and will likely be dealing with the aftermath for weeks to come are focused on politics right now. Some might sit out the election because they simply have more important things to worry about.Beyond practical concerns, how else can a natural disaster influence an election?The other side of the equation, which is what political scientists like myself are mostly focusing on, is whether people take the fact that a natural disaster happened into consideration when they vote.Two scholars, Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels, have argued that sometimes voters are not great at figuring out how to incorporate bad things that happened to them into a voting position. In some cases, it is entirely fair to hold an elected official responsible for bad outcomes that affect people's lives. But at other moments, bad things can happen to us without that being the fault of an incumbent president or governor. And voters should ideally be able to balance out these different types of bad things - those it is fair to punish elected officials for, and those for which it isn't fair to hold them responsible.After all, a devastating hurricane is terrible, but it is not Kamala Harris' fault that it happened. But Achen and Bartels argue that voters frequently still punish elected officials for random bad events like this.Their most famous example is the consequences of a series of shark attacks off the New Jersey coast in the summer of 1916. As a result of those attacks, the New Jersey tourism industry saw a major decline. While these findings are still being debated, Achen and Bartels argue that Jersey shore voters subsequently voted against Woodrow Wilson in the 1916 presidential election at a higher rate than they would have had the shark attacks not happened. They argue that voters did this even though Wilson had no involvement in the shark attacks.How else do voters consider bad events when they vote?Scholars like John Gasper and Andrew Reeves argue that voters mostly care whether elected officials respond appropriately to a disaster. So, if the president does a good job reacting, voters do not actually punish them at all in the next election. However, voters can punish elected officials if they feel like the response is not correct.The fact that Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana in 2005 was not the fault of then-President George W. Bush. But the perceived slowness of the government response is something a voter could have held him responsible for.How do voters' political affiliations affect where and how they lay the blame?Colleagues and I have shown that how people interpret the combination of a disaster and the government response is likely colored by their own partisanship.We looked at both the effects of Superstorm Sandy on the 2012 presidential election and natural disasters' impact on elections more broadly from 1972 through 2004. One core finding is that when presidents reject state officials' disaster declaration requests, they lose votes in affected counties - but only if those counties were already more supportive of the opposite party.If there is a strong positive government response, the incumbent president or their party can actually gain votes or lose voters affected by a disaster. So, Republicans affected by the hurricanes could become more inclined to vote against Harris if they feel like they are not getting the help they need. But it could also help Harris if affected Democrats feel like they are getting enough aid.The major takeaway is that if the government responds really effectively to a natural disaster or other emergency, there is not a huge electoral penalty - and there could even be a small reward.That is not irrelevant in a close election. If Republicans in affected areas in North Carolina feel the government response has been poor and it inspires them to turn out in higher numbers to punish Harris, that could matter. But if they feel like the response has been adequate, research suggests either no real effect on their support for Harris - or possibly even an increase in Harris voters.How much influence can a politician have on people assessing a government response?Scholars mostly assume that people affected can tell whether the government response was good or not. Trump and other Republicans are falsely saying that the response is slow and falsely claiming that Federal Emergency Management Agency money is being spent on immigrants who are not living in the country legally. There does not appear to be a slow government response to the hurricane in North Carolina, and there's no evidence the response is insufficient in Florida, either.So, the question now is whether voters affected by these hurricanes will respond based on their actual lived experiences, or how they are told they are living their experience.This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

    "content": "DANA BASH, CNN: Congressman, before I let you go, I do want to ask about a law that Congress passed, a new version of the Electoral Count Act. They passed it two years ago, and it makes it harder to object to certifying election results on January 6, 2025 and beyond.Some Trump allies have argued that's unconstitutional. The House speaker hasn't taken a clear position. Should Congress follow that law in certifying the 2024 presidential election?REP. BYRON DONALDS: Look, I think, when you're talking about the election this November, the thing people want is that local jurisdictions follow the law passed by the states.As long as everybody does that, there's not going to be any problem certifying this election this November. But what really matters about this election are the issues facing the American people, not the Electoral College Count Act, because what we need is a president who's going to secure our border, actually make our foreign policy be strong again and make sense again. That's what matters.BASH: Right. But my question is, are you going to follow the new law? Are you going to follow the new law about certifying the election?DONALDS: As long -- and I have been very clear, Dana. As long as states and jurisdictions follow election procedures in their states, there will be no problem for me or anybody on Capitol Hill.BASH: All right, well, that's a giant loophole that you're leaving there, which -- there's no evidence that that has not happened. It didn't happen in 2020.DONALDS: That's not a loophole. That's actually not a loophole, Dana, and if you look at what happened in Pennsylvania, Arizona, and other jurisdictions...BASH: There's absolutely -- Congressman...DONALDS: ... in 2020, they did not follow election procedures passed by the state legislature. That's an empirical fact.BASH: There is no evidence of widespread fraud. That went through, what, 60 court cases, and even Bill Barr, the former president...DONALDS: Dana, I did not say fraud. You said fraud.What I'm talking about -- and if you want to talk about it, let's be clear. You had the state of Pennsylvania, where the state Supreme Court said they would count ballots three days after the polls closed in Pennsylvania in 2020. That's a violation of state law passed by the legislature, signed by the governor. That's what happened in the state of Pennsylvania. That's one example.",

    "content": "By Katelyn Caralle, senior US political reporter in Washington, DCKamala Harris is facing the wrath of TIME's owner after she refused to participate in an interview with the renowned news magazine.The vice president has declined to participate in an interview with several traditional media outlets since taking over Joe Biden's campaign and leading the 2024 Democratic presidential ticket, and has faced widespread criticism for her sparse media strategy.Marc Benioff wrote about his disappointment with X, claiming that Time Magazine had reached out several times for an interview with the presidential candidate.\"Despite multiple requests, TIME has not been granted an interview with Kamala Harris - unlike every other presidential candidate,\" the owner wrote on Sunday.Benioff included a link to interviews Time Magazine conducted with former President Donald Trump and President Biden when he was still running for re-election in 2024.Time owner Marc Benioff (pictured) is furious that Vice President Kamala Harris has rejected repeated requests from the magazine to appear for an interview before the 2024 presidential electionYour browser does not support iframes.\"We believe in transparency and publish every interview in full,\" he added. \"Why doesn't the vice president interact with the public on the same level?\"The charges against Harris' refusal to interview with the magazine come as CBS News faces intense backlash for positively editing the candidate's 60 Minutes interview.A Time article published on October 10 titled What Kind of President Would Kamala Harris Be? notes that the vice president has \"declined repeated requests for an interview for this story.\"Trump, on the other hand, spoke about his policy vision for 90 minutes with a TIME reporter in two interviews. Biden spoke to TIME for a while before dropping out of the race,\" they added in that article.Critics, especially pro-MAGA social media accounts, have questioned Harris' media strategy ahead of the election.There are only 22 days until the election next month and Harris has not yet made the full push on media appearances as most candidates do in the run-up to Election Day.VP Harris's media strategy has been questioned by critics after she rejected a number of mainstream and traditional media outlets in favor of more alternative media, such as the raunchy, sex-oriented podcast Call Her Daddy.The VP has conducted some questionable interviews, such as with the raunchy and sex-oriented podcast Call Her Daddy.

    "title": "The California community caught between a powerful megachurch and far-right extremists",
    "content": "This is the third in a series of three stories on the run-up to the 2024 US presidential election in Shasta county, a region of 180,000 people in northern California that has emerged as a center of the election denial movement and hotbed for far-right politics. Read the first and second story.For years, an extremist far-right movement has worked to transform one of California's most conservative regions. Since gaining a majority on Shasta county's governing body, they have managed to spark an exodus of government workers, attempted to do away with the voting system and fought the state over policies pertaining to Covid-19 and the second amendment.Earlier this year, voters in the community of 180,000 - perhaps tired of Shasta's national notoriety as a hotbed for extremist politics and election denialism - declared they had had enough. In a stunning rebuke, they voted out a far-right leader by an enormous margin, handing his seat to a political newcomer.Matt Plummer, a Yale-educated former college football player who owns a corporate training business, pledged to provide an alternative to the \"hostility and division\" tearing Shasta apart. Supporters view Plummer, with his focus on issues such as crime, roads and homelessness, as someone who can help the community chart a path out of the upheaval.But others are concerned about Plummer's connection to another powerful and ultra-conservative force that has reshaped the region: Bethel church. The megachurch has more than 11,000 members, including Plummer, and a school of \"supernatural ministry\" that serves 2,000 students a year.Bethel leaders once said that God wanted Donald Trump to have a second term and have claimed that Joe Biden won the 2020 election by \"fraud\". Church members have become major players in local government - three of the five members on the city council in Redding, the county seat, attend Bethel. The city's vice-mayor is a church elder.The church is involved in nearly every part of Shasta county, and is a cornerstone of the local economy, said Doni Chamberlain, a longtime local journalist and chronicler of the area.Shasta's extreme political landscape has forced residents to choose between a toxic rightwing movement and a church that also has deeply conservative and extreme beliefs, she said.\"This is the bind we're in,\" she said. \"Shasta county is in this weird extremist sandwich where we have the rightwing pushing for guns and splitting the state. And there is the other extreme side of the sandwich that is Bethel church. Then the middle where people are trying to figure out how to survive in this place.\"***Before Shasta county garnered national attention for its fierce opposition to Covid-19 restrictions and efforts to institute a hand-count voting system favored by those who believe lies about election fraud, it was Bethel church that raised the region's profile.There are churches - of which Shasta county has plenty - and then there is Bethel, a behemoth institution without parallel in the area. First established in a private home in 1952, it now has more than 11,000 members - more than 10% of the population in the city of Redding - where the church is based.Bethel's transformation came under the direction of Bill Johnson, the son of a long-serving pastor who began leading the church with Beni, his wife, in 1996. The church has grown significantly, opening a school, a youth outreach program and Bethel Music, a record label that produces popular worship music and reported $18m in revenue in 2023. Justin Bieber is a fan and has filmed himself covering a song from a Bethel artist. Today several of Johnson's children work as senior leaders in the church.But it's Bethel's school of supernatural ministry, which has been called a \"Christian Hogwarts\", that is often credited with its growth. The program was founded by Kris and Kathy Vallotton, the senior leaders of the church, and teaches students that they can perform miracles and heal through prayer. \"Students will learn how to read, understand, and 'do' the Bible, how to practice His presence, to witness, heal the sick, prophesy, preach, pray, cast out demons and much more,\" the school website states.Related: How an ultra-right majority in California's far north picked a novice to run its electionsPeople travel to Redding from around the world, more than 100 countries, to attend the vocational program. Students have been known to approach people in the city, particularly those in casts or with walkers, to offer prayers for healing. The focus on \"supernatural power\" is fundamental to the church, which in 2019 asked members to pray for the resurrection of a two-year-old girl.Bethel has long believed in the power of healing people through prayer. Chamberlain joined the church as a child after her mother died and her siblings were adopted by a local couple who were members. When they learned that Chamberlain and her twin sister had a neurological disorder that caused involuntary movements, church elders came to treat their \"demons\" and the children were made to throw away their medications, Chamberlain recalled.\"When you have a bunch of adults circling around you and putting their hands on your heads and shaking you, it was pretty intimidating,\" she said, adding that they coached her on how to speak in tongues.\"It's like being waterboarded, you just give up and give in so they leave you alone. Then you're in the club.\"Since its founding in 1998, Bethel's supernatural school has brought thousands of people to Redding. They are a visible presence around the city, in its grocery stores and the hip cafes and bakeries operated by Bethel members. And as the church's footprint has grown, so too has criticism of its role.Supporters say the church has been a positive force in Redding and that it's natural for a large institution to attract scrutiny but that members want to be a part of the community in which they live. They often point to local volunteer work or when the church donated money to fund police positions in Redding and began leasing the local auditorium when it appeared the city would have to close it down.Bethel did not respond to multiple requests for comment.But other Shasta county residents argue the church has changed the fabric of the community and worsened an existing housing shortage by drawing thousands of students to the area while driving up costs.\"If you look from the outside in, there seems to be positives. They've done good things, but I don't feel like on balance what they've done is for the good of the community in general,\" said Robert Sid, a Shasta county resident who supported Plummer. \"Their Hogwarts supernatural ministry has really played into flooding the market and artificially pricing things that the regular Redding person can't afford.\"Critics have expressed discomfort with church members who hold key positions in local government voting on proposals from Bethel to expand. Some residents have joined a Facebook group to identify businesses connected to the church.\" tithe to the church. If you patronize a Bethel-affiliated business then now some of those profits are being tithed to the church. You're kind of indirectly supporting the church by doing that,\" said Rachel Strickland, who started the group. \"People don't want to do that.\"And for some in this deeply conservative region, where Republicans outnumber Democrats two to one, the church's political ties have been cause for concern as well. Religious experts have described it as closely related to the New Apostolic Reformation, a movement built around the idea of modern-day prophets and apostles that aims to have Christians transform society and rule over key political and cultural institutions, referred to as the \"Seven Mountain Mandate\".Johnson co-authored a book, Invading Babylon: the 7 Mountain Mandate, which advises Christians to exert influence in seven core areas: church, family, education, government, media, arts and commerce.Matthew D Taylor, a senior scholar at the Institute for Islamic, Christian and Jewish studies who has studied Bethel, argued that the church appears to be trying to implement the Seven Mountain Mandate in its community.Related: Extremist politics divided this conservative California community. What will it take to turn the tide?\"I think they very much intend to enact this bigger vision of Christian supremacy and Christian dominance in the Redding area. It doesn't mean they are always overt about that,\" said Taylor, the author of a book on the New Apostolic Reformation for which he interviewed Johnson.Bethel leaders endorsed Donald Trump, and in 2021 one apologized for incorrectly prophesying that he would win a second term. The church has come out against efforts to restrict conversion therapy. In 2019, several figures associated with the church attended an Oval Office event with Trump to pray over the president. Bethel has sought to distance itself from January 6, however, Taylor said.\"They are trying to tone down public rhetoric and make themselves  less extreme than they are but as far as I can tell they haven't moderated their extremism. They are just trying to package it in a better way,\" he argued.The church has long emphasized that the beliefs of individual church members are not necessarily reflective of the church's positions. Chamberlain, who left the church as a young adult, argues it is important to distinguish between the church leadership and its members.\"You have to separate the leaders of the church, the people who are millionaires and drive expensive cars, cars that cost as much as somebody might pay for a house. They have vacation homes and eat at The French Laundry,\" Chamberlain said.They live a life of the rich and famous, she added, while some Bethel members, and students, leave their homes abroad and live in extreme poverty to be close to the church.Members point out that they are not a monolith.Matt Plummer's journey to Redding began the same way thousands of others have - with Bethel. He moved to the city in 2016 with his wife and daughters to attend the church, and remains a member, he said in an interview with the Guardian.Plummer, who grew up in rural New Jersey where his first job was on a horse farm, was drawn to the region's access to nature from hiking to swimming holes, he said, and the family has developed deep ties to the area.He decided to run for the board of supervisors after working in several political campaigns and seeing the intense polarization and problems that have plagued Shasta county.\"We have tied basically for the highest suicide rate in the state. You have one of the highest rates of childhood trauma and one of the highest rates of kids being born with drug withdrawal effects,\" he said. \"This is a pretty cool community that has a lot to offer but at the same time if you look at all these dimensions of what makes a community thrive, we're trailing.\"He had a tough race ahead of him seeking to unseat Patrick Jones, who previously served on the Redding city council and had been a supervisor for three years as well as a leader of the anti-establishment movement that has come to define local politics.Jones, a gun store manager, led some of the county's most controversial efforts, including attempting to upend the voting system and moving to allow people to carry firearms in public buildings in violation of state law. He also spread conspiracy theories, telling a conservative national news outlet: \"Elections have been manipulated at the county level for decades.\"He once responded to a reporter's query by telling them to \"drop dead\".While polarizing, Jones was well-known and had been in politics for years, Plummer said, and had the backing of a Connecticut magnate who has poured millions of dollars into local elections.Plummer made up for that by making personal contact, and personally knocked on about 9,000 doors, he said (there are about 23,000 registered voters in his district).\"People care if you show up and meet them,\" he said.He sought to stay out of ideological debates and focus on what residents were worried about, primarily public safety, roads and homelessness. The number of unhoused residents has grown significantly in recent years from 793 in 2022 to 1,013 people in 2023.\"My opponent had been on the board almost four years and he had been on city council for eight years, which had some jurisdiction over the same things. And they had all gotten worse,\" he said.His affiliation with Bethel was a concern, he acknowledged, one he tried to address and alleviate. \"I'm not speaking on stage and not this type of celebrity at Bethel. I just go there on a Sunday morning.\"\"One of the things I said is: 'I'm not running to represent Bethel and so my job is not to defend Bethel' and so when people would attack Bethel for things, I'd say OK, that's fine. That's actually not my priority here,\" he said.Strickland, who has described Bethel as a cult, said the choice put the community in a tough position, but that even in her Facebook group people seemed to be leaning toward Plummer. \"For me Patrick Jones is much more dangerous.\"Plummer received the endorsement of Chamberlain's publication, A News Cafe, drawing backlash from some readers who started referring to the outlet as Bethel Cafe.\"It was a tough call. I have a problem with Bethel on a lot of levels, but just kind of putting on your thinking cap sometimes the Bethel candidates were the best choice for the positions,\" she said.\"Do we vote for Patrick Jones who is pushing guns and open carry? Or do we vote for Matt Plummer who is a Bethel member? He's also articulate, educated and smart.\"And in the current political climate in the county, Chamberlain mused, few people would want to subject themselves to running for office. \"The Bethel people are kind of impervious to it. It's scriptural.\"",

    "title": "The California community caught between a powerful megachurch and far-right extremists",
    "content": "Shasta residents voted out an anti-establishment leader in favor of a business owner who attends the enormously popular yet controversial Bethel churchThis is the third in a series of three stories on the run-up to the 2024 US presidential election in Shasta county, a region of 180,000 people in northern California that has emerged as a center of the election denial movement and hotbed for far-right politics. Read the first and second story.For years, an extremist far-right movement has worked to transform one of California's most conservative regions. Since gaining a majority on Shasta county's governing body, they have managed to spark an exodus of government workers, attempted to do away with the voting system and fought the state over policies pertaining to Covid-19 and the second amendment.Earlier this year, voters in the community of 180,000 - perhaps tired of Shasta's national notoriety as a hotbed for extremist politics and election denialism - declared they had had enough. In a stunning rebuke, they voted out a far-right leader by an enormous margin, handing his seat to a political newcomer.Matt Plummer, a Yale-educated former college football player who owns a corporate training business, pledged to provide an alternative to the \"hostility and division\" tearing Shasta apart. Supporters view Plummer, with his focus on issues such as crime, roads and homelessness, as someone who can help the community chart a path out of the upheaval.But others are concerned about Plummer's connection to another powerful and ultra-conservative force that has reshaped the region: Bethel church. The megachurch has more than 11,000 members, including Plummer, and a school of \"supernatural ministry\" that serves 2,000 students a year.Bethel leaders once said that God wanted Donald Trump to have a second term and have claimed that Joe Biden won the 2020 election by \"fraud\". Church members have become major players in local government - three of the five members on the city council in Redding, the county seat, attend Bethel. The city's vice-mayor is a church elder.The church is involved in nearly every part of Shasta county, and is a cornerstone of the local economy, said Doni Chamberlain, a longtime local journalist and chronicler of the area.Shasta's extreme political landscape has forced residents to choose between a toxic rightwing movement and a church that also has deeply conservative and extreme beliefs, she said.\"This is the bind we're in,\" she said. \"Shasta county is in this weird extremist sandwich where we have the rightwing pushing for guns and splitting the state. And there is the other extreme side of the sandwich that is Bethel church. Then the middle where people are trying to figure out how to survive in this place.\"Before Shasta county garnered national attention for its fierce opposition to Covid-19 restrictions and efforts to institute a hand-count voting system favored by those who believe lies about election fraud, it was Bethel church that raised the region's profile.There are churches - of which Shasta county has plenty - and then there is Bethel, a behemoth institution without parallel in the area. First established in a private home in 1952, it now has more than 11,000 members - more than 10% of the population in the city of Redding - where the church is based.Bethel's transformation came under the direction of Bill Johnson, the son of a long-serving pastor who began leading the church with Beni, his wife, in 1996. The church has grown significantly, opening a school, a youth outreach program and Bethel Music, a record label that produces popular worship music and reported $18m in revenue in 2023. Justin Bieber is a fan and has filmed himself covering a song from a Bethel artist. Today several of Johnson's children work as senior leaders in the church.But it's Bethel's school of supernatural ministry, which has been called a \"Christian Hogwarts\", that is often credited with its growth. The program was founded by Kris and Kathy Vallotton, the senior leaders of the church, and teaches students that they can perform miracles and heal through prayer. \"Students will learn how to read, understand, and 'do' the Bible, how to practice His presence, to witness, heal the sick, prophesy, preach, pray, cast out demons and much more,\" the school website states.People travel to Redding from around the world, more than 100 countries, to attend the vocational program. Students have been known to approach people in the city, particularly those in casts or with walkers, to offer prayers for healing. The focus on \"supernatural power\" is fundamental to the church, which in 2019 asked members to pray for the resurrection of a two-year-old girl.Bethel has long believed in the power of healing people through prayer. Chamberlain joined the church as a child after her mother died and her siblings were adopted by a local couple who were members. When they learned that Chamberlain and her twin sister had a neurological disorder that caused involuntary movements, church elders came to treat their \"demons\" and the children were made to throw away their medications, Chamberlain recalled.\"When you have a bunch of adults circling around you and putting their hands on your heads and shaking you, it was pretty intimidating,\" she said, adding that they coached her on how to speak in tongues.\"It's like being waterboarded, you just give up and give in so they leave you alone. Then you're in the club.\"Since its founding in 1998, Bethel's supernatural school has brought thousands of people to Redding. They are a visible presence around the city, in its grocery stores and the hip cafes and bakeries operated by Bethel members. And as the church's footprint has grown, so too has criticism of its role.Supporters say the church has been a positive force in Redding and that it's natural for a large institution to attract scrutiny but that members want to be a part of the community in which they live. They often point to local volunteer work or when the church donated money to fund police positions in Redding and began leasing the local auditorium when it appeared the city would have to close it down.Bethel did not respond to multiple requests for comment.But other Shasta county residents argue the church has changed the fabric of the community and worsened an existing housing shortage by drawing thousands of students to the area while driving up costs.\"If you look from the outside in, there seems to be positives. They've done good things, but I don't feel like on balance what they've done is for the good of the community in general,\" said Robert Sid, a Shasta county resident who supported Plummer. \"Their Hogwarts supernatural ministry has really played into flooding the market and artificially pricing things that the regular Redding person can't afford.\"Critics have expressed discomfort with church members who hold key positions in local government voting on proposals from Bethel to expand. Some residents have joined a Facebook group to identify businesses connected to the church.\" tithe to the church. If you patronize a Bethel-affiliated business then now some of those profits are being tithed to the church. You're kind of indirectly supporting the church by doing that,\" said Rachel Strickland, who started the group. \"People don't want to do that.\"And for some in this deeply conservative region, where Republicans outnumber Democrats two to one, the church's political ties have been cause for concern as well. Religious experts have described it as closely related to the New Apostolic Reformation, a movement built around the idea of modern-day prophets and apostles that aims to have Christians transform society and rule over key political and cultural institutions, referred to as the \"Seven Mountain Mandate\".Johnson co-authored a book, Invading Babylon: the 7 Mountain Mandate, which advises Christians to exert influence in seven core areas: church, family, education, government, media, arts and commerce.Matthew D Taylor, a senior scholar at the Institute for Islamic, Christian and Jewish studies who has studied Bethel, argued that the church appears to be trying to implement the Seven Mountain Mandate in its community.\"I think they very much intend to enact this bigger vision of Christian supremacy and Christian dominance in the Redding area. It doesn't mean they are always overt about that,\" said Taylor, the author of a book on the New Apostolic Reformation for which he interviewed Johnson.Bethel leaders endorsed Donald Trump, and in 2021 one apologized for incorrectly prophesying that he would win a second term. The church has come out against efforts to restrict conversion therapy. In 2019, several figures associated with the church attended an Oval Office event with Trump to pray over the president. Bethel has sought to distance itself from January 6, however, Taylor said.\"They are trying to tone down public rhetoric and make themselves  less extreme than they are but as far as I can tell they haven't moderated their extremism. They are just trying to package it in a better way,\" he argued.The church has long emphasized that the beliefs of individual church members are not necessarily reflective of the church's positions. Chamberlain, who left the church as a young adult, argues it is important to distinguish between the church leadership and its members.\"You have to separate the leaders of the church, the people who are millionaires and drive expensive cars, cars that cost as much as somebody might pay for a house. They have vacation homes and eat at The French Laundry,\" Chamberlain said.They live a life of the rich and famous, she added, while some Bethel members, and students, leave their homes abroad and live in extreme poverty to be close to the church.Members point out that they are not a monolith.Matt Plummer's journey to Redding began the same way thousands of others have - with Bethel. He moved to the city in 2016 with his wife and daughters to attend the church, and remains a member, he said in an interview with the Guardian.Plummer, who grew up in rural New Jersey where his first job was on a horse farm, was drawn to the region's access to nature from hiking to swimming holes, he said, and the family has developed deep ties to the area.He decided to run for the board of supervisors after working in several political campaigns and seeing the intense polarization and problems that have plagued Shasta county.\"We have tied basically for the highest suicide rate in the state. You have one of the highest rates of childhood trauma and one of the highest rates of kids being born with drug withdrawal effects,\" he said. \"This is a pretty cool community that has a lot to offer but at the same time if you look at all these dimensions of what makes a community thrive, we're trailing.\"He had a tough race ahead of him seeking to unseat Patrick Jones, who previously served on the Redding city council and had been a supervisor for three years as well as a leader of the anti-establishment movement that has come to define local politics.Jones, a gun store manager, led some of the county's most controversial efforts, including attempting to upend the voting system and moving to allow people to carry firearms in public buildings in violation of state law. He also spread conspiracy theories, telling a conservative national news outlet: \"Elections have been manipulated at the county level for decades.\"He once responded to a reporter's query by telling them to \"drop dead\".While polarizing, Jones was well-known and had been in politics for years, Plummer said, and had the backing of a Connecticut magnate who has poured millions of dollars into local elections.Plummer made up for that by making personal contact, and personally knocked on about 9,000 doors, he said (there are about 23,000 registered voters in his district).\"People care if you show up and meet them,\" he said.He sought to stay out of ideological debates and focus on what residents were worried about, primarily public safety, roads and homelessness. The number of unhoused residents has grown significantly in recent years from 793 in 2022 to 1,013 people in 2023.\"My opponent had been on the board almost four years and he had been on city council for eight years, which had some jurisdiction over the same things. And they had all gotten worse,\" he said.His affiliation with Bethel was a concern, he acknowledged, one he tried to address and alleviate. \"I'm not speaking on stage and not this type of celebrity at Bethel. I just go there on a Sunday morning.\"\"One of the things I said is: 'I'm not running to represent Bethel and so my job is not to defend Bethel' and so when people would attack Bethel for things, I'd say OK, that's fine. That's actually not my priority here,\" he said.Strickland, who has described Bethel as a cult, said the choice put the community in a tough position, but that even in her Facebook group people seemed to be leaning toward Plummer. \"For me Patrick Jones is much more dangerous.\"Plummer received the endorsement of Chamberlain's publication, A News Cafe, drawing backlash from some readers who started referring to the outlet as Bethel Cafe.\"It was a tough call. I have a problem with Bethel on a lot of levels, but just kind of putting on your thinking cap sometimes the Bethel candidates were the best choice for the positions,\" she said.\"Do we vote for Patrick Jones who is pushing guns and open carry? Or do we vote for Matt Plummer who is a Bethel member? He's also articulate, educated and smart.\"And in the current political climate in the county, Chamberlain mused, few people would want to subject themselves to running for office. \"The Bethel people are kind of impervious to it. It's scriptural.\"",

    "title": "2024 U.S. Presidential Election: A Difficult Choice on Election Day, a Tougher Test for Democracy the Day After",
    "content": "As early voting has begun in several states in the United States, the Uncommitted National Movement (UNM) announced, on September 19th, in a press conference and a statement published on social media that it would not support Kamala Harris' campaign, the Democratic Party presidential candidate.This position comes in the context of an election marked by significant uncertainties and polarization due to the U.S. administration's unconditional support for Israel's non-proportional war on Gaza, Palestine since October 7, 2023, on the one hand, and the presence of the former President Donald Trump--known for his authoritarian tendencies as well as populist and racist rhetoric--as the Republican Party presidential candidate nominee, on the other hand.The UNM made this announcement after Harris failed to respond to its demands that call for:The movement also stressed the importance of not voting for the Republican candidate Donald Trump due to his dangerous pro-war stance on Gaza. It also advised against voting for a third party, which could contribute to Trump's victory.Through this statement, the movement also asserted its commitment to pressuring the U.S. administration to achieve its demands. This position presents a significant challenge to the Democratic Party and triggers many questions about its impact on the political landscape on Election Day and beyond, especially in the event of Trump's win.The UNM was launched in February of this year by activists within the Democratic Party.The movement initiated a protest campaign to urge the US administration to halt Israel's war on Gaza following the events of October 7, 2023.To this end, and in preparation for the Democratic Party's presidential primaries, the movement organized, and in a very short period, an unexpectedly successful campaign in the state of Michigan.The campaign mobilized voters to choose \"Uncommitted\" instead of \"Joe Biden\" on the ballot as a form of pressure to demonstrate to the Democratic Party the weight of votes calling for an end to the war on Gaza.Following this initial success, the movement led other campaigns that achieved remarkable results in states such as Wisconsin, Washington, Minnesota, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Mexico, Oregon, and Hawaii. As a result of this mobilization, the campaign garnered more than 700,000 votes nationwide and secured 37 delegates at the Democratic National Convention.The importance of the campaign lies in the fact that in most of these states, the percentage of votes as \"Uncommitted\" exceeds the margin by which Trump won the 2020 election. Notably, the uncommitted votes were not limited to American Muslims and Arabs; the majority came from other ethnic and social groups within American society, particularly among whites, African Americans, and Latinos.The position of the Uncommitted Movement represents a significant loss for the Democratic Party that can cost it the upcoming presidential election on November 5th. This is especially true given that the movement consists of a substantial \"voting bloc\" that many election experts believe could be decisive on election day, particularly in swing states since the race for the White House between the Republican and Democratic parties is extremely close. For example, Muslim voters within the movement are among the most politically engaged religious groups in the U.S. and they often vote based on key issues and not party affiliation. According to a poll and report published on September, 18 of this year by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU), in the 2020 election, Biden narrowly beat Trump (46% to 45%) in three swing states: Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Georgia. This suggests that the strong support Biden received from Muslim voters was crucial for his victory. The situation appears to be similarly tight in the current election as most ongoing polls in the U.S. indicate a close race between the Democratic and Republican campaigns. As a result, swing states are very likely expected to determine the outcome as both candidates have equal chances of winning. Although it is unlikely that these voters will shift their support to Trump. The same ISPU poll shows that the level of Muslim support for Trump is still about the same since 2016, particularly in swing states. Even in case these voters decide to abstain from voting or support a third party--as a protest vote--this could indirectly benefit Trump.For instance, votes for Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, whose campaign has gained noticeable support, especially among Arab and Muslim American voters, could provide an advantage to Trump. Experts explain that in a closely contested two-party election, the presence of a third party often benefits one of the main candidates. This dynamic poses a serious challenge for the Democratic Party as it risks losing critical votes in key swing states.The position of the current US administration on the war in Gaza certainly presents a difficult choice and challenge for many Democratic Party voters and supporters as well as undecided voters within the general electorate due to their dissatisfaction with both parties, especially among youth.At the same time, many indicators also suggest that the period following the November 5th election will also be a difficult one as the U.S. democratic system and institutions will face greater challenges than those experienced during Trump's presidency between 2016 and 2020.In this context, many political analysts-- such as Professor Jack Goldstone, an expert in social movements and revolutions who raised alarms in 2020 of the possibility of events similar to January 6, 2021, when Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol to stop the certification of the election results to prevent the inauguration of Joe Biden as new President--warn that there is a high likelihood that the U.S. could face significant chaos that can escalate to a civil war.Among the significant indicators of such a possibility are: continued attempts to undermine the democratic process and state institutions, sharp polarization within American society, increasing level of political violence rhetoric, and weakening trust between citizens, state institutions, and political actors.Continued Attempts to Undermine the Democratic Process and Institutions are still key features of Trump's rhetoric. Trump has consistently reminded his supporters that \"We will win, and we won't lose the election; and if we do, it's because of a rigged system and because the Democrats will rig the elections just like they did in 2020 that I won.\" This narrative suggests that, in the event of a loss, Trump is willing to challenge the democratic outcome of the elections and undermine the rule of law, just as he attempted to do in 2021. Most importantly, many analysts point out that Trump seems to be more organized and ready to act with the backing of far-right groups.Given Trump's authoritarian tendencies, many observers do not rule out the possibility of a coup attempt. While this may not involve military force, it could take other forms that obstruct the functioning of constitutional institutions and the enforcement of the law, throwing the country into chaos similar to what he did in 2021 when he incited the attack on the US Capitol. The concern is that if Trump fails to win the election, he and his supporters might engage in disruptive actions that would challenge the democratic norms, leading to widespread disorder and causing political instability in the U.S.In the event of a Trump victory in the 2024 election, the situation may not be much different. Trump will feel more empowered to consolidate authoritarian power that would lead the country into further chaos by undermining democratic institutions and the rule of law. It won't be surprising if Trump issues hasty populist executive orders that erode the principles of diversity and inclusion in the country. For example, he may first target immigrants, just as he did in 2017 with the \"Muslim Ban.\" Similarly, he could issue an executive order to ban abortion. These would be symbolic acts to show his supporters that he is delivering on his campaign promises and urge them to continue supporting him in all his decisions.In the next phase, Trump will continue to use the executive constitutional powers to undermine the institutions that uphold the democratic system in the U.S.He is also expected to rely on the support of Republican lawmakers, especially if the party holds a majority in one or both chambers in Congress, taking into consideration that Trump currently has near-complete control over the Republican Party and a far-right faction that is loyal to him is driving the party's agenda in Congress.This could lead to the enactment of disruptive laws and decisions that would cause widespread institutional dysfunction, possibly paralyzing key functions of the government. A similar scenario occurred during his previous term with the infamous \"Government Shutdown\" in 2018 which lasted 35 days due to a deadlock between Trump and Congress over the federal budget justifying it as a fight against the so-called \"deep state.\" As a result, more than 800,000 federal employees lost their paychecks, and government services were severely disrupted, both domestically and internationally. Trump's presidency is also expected to continue with his isolationist foreign policies.This might include further withdrawals from international agreements and organizations similar to what he did in his first term when he withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement, the United Nations Human Rights Council, the World Health Organization, and The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). All acts would further weaken the U.S. leadership stance on the international stage and strain its relationships with its traditional allies.In this respect, it is worth mentioning the so-called \"Project 2025,\" also known as the \"2025 Presidential Transition Project,\" a political initiative published by the conservative Heritage Foundation in 2023.Its goal is to promote conservative and right-wing policies aimed at reshaping the U.S. federal government and strengthening the executive power should Trump win the 2024 presidential election. Although Trump denies any direct knowledge or involvement with the project, its measures align with his rhetoric and promises.Furthermore, numerous reports and leaks suggest that several key figures associated with it are among Trump's strongest allies and supporters. Many political analysts believe that project has been prepared to be adopted by Trump on the first day of his presidency, should he win, as it outlines a comprehensive roadmap to dismantle what he refers to as the \"deep state.\"Experts also point out that the project has an authoritarian approach and is heavily based on \"loyalty\" that will erode the principle of nonpartisan governance and meritocracy. Project 2025 includes several dangerous measures, such as eliminating the Departments of Education and Homeland Security and placing the FBI directly under the presidential authority.According to the same project, thousands of government employees and qualified civil servants would be dismissed and replaced by a carefully selected group loyal to Trump and supportive of conservative policies.There are also significant concerns that civil rights and freedoms could experience a major setback in the event of a second Trump presidency. It is very likely that he could make decisions affecting freedom of expression and the right to protest taking into consideration his stance on the media, racial justice, voting rights, etc ... taking into consideration that some of the U.S. Supreme Court members were his appointees during his first term. In his current campaign rallies, Trump does not hesitate to attack all his opponents and critics among individuals and institutions. It is also worth noting that the 2025 Project includes many measures that threaten rights and freedoms. Using his presidential authorities, analysts do not preclude the possibility that Trump could call for the intervention of the National Guard to suppress civil society activities, such as preventing protests and mass rallies that criticize his policies, like the historic national \"Women's March\" that took place on January 23, 2017, as the first large civil society protest in response to his general policies after his inauguration as the new president.Sharp Polarization within American Society: American society has always experienced a degree of polarization, but it has intensified in the last two decades. This polarization is currently reflected by the tight race between the Democratic and Republican campaigns as polls indicate that each party has maintained its voter base since 2020.The deadlock in Congress, where laws are rarely passed in a bi-partisan way also reflects this polarization as both parties persist to oppose each other, often for political calculations that frequently disregard the public interest. One example was in 2023 when we witnessed how the Republican Kevin McCarthy paid the price when he worked with the Democratic Party to pass the federal budget in Congress to avoid another catastrophic government shutdown. As a consequence, McCarthy was removed from his position as Speaker of the House by members of his party.Increasing Level of Political Violence Rhetoric, especially promoted by Trump and his Republican supporters, has become evident through the spread of fake news and incitement against Democrats, immigrants, and any opponent. In its October 2023 issue, Time Magazine indicates that more than 33% of Republicans expressed that violence might be the solution to \"save\" the United States.Another poll by The New York Times indicates that 450 federal judges received threats last year, a 150% increase compared to 2019; while members of Congress received 8,000 threats, a 50% increase compared to 2018. One example of this rhetoric is the false and dangerous racist claims that Trump made about Haitian immigrants during the presidential debate with Harris on September 10th of this year.In other rallies, he also declared that he would deport all supporters of Palestine and those calling for #Ceasefire_in_Gaza, claiming that they support Hamas and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). Moreover, Trump continues to implicitly encourage political violence by repeatedly promising a presidential pardon for those involved in the attack on the U.S. Capitol in 2021. He also attacks and criticizes anyone who supports the Democratic campaign or opposes his campaign, including prominent figures from politics, art, and other fields. This rhetoric of violence is further fueled by Trump's attacks on and questioning of electoral governance institutions and the judiciary, particularly after all such entities affirmed that the 2020 election results were free from any violations that could undermine its credibility. It is also worth mentioning that many legal and political experts assert that both the Department of Justice and Congress made a grave mistake by not preventing Trump from running for office again, especially after it was demonstrated that he incited the 2021 U.S. Capitol attack. The absence of such a measure has allowed him to move forward as a presidential candidate and emboldened him to continue his populist and racist rhetoric, which incites violence and threatens social peace.Weakening Trust between Citizens, State Institutions, and Elected Officials: the widening gap between the rich and the poor in the United States over the past decades has significantly undermined trust in the government. Numerous studies have revealed that a large segment of the middle class has fallen behind and has felt abandoned by the state and is seeking change. This is due to public policies that favor the wealthy and fail to strengthen citizens' socio-economic rights in areas such as employment, healthcare, and education.The issue of \"gun violence\" is a good example of this broken trust. Despite the tragic repetitive shooting incidents by ordinary citizens that threaten American lives more than anything else, and despite the large mobilization and calls organized by civil society groups like \"The March of Our Lives\" Movement, Congress remains unable to take any meaningful action to restrict guns access, largely because of the pressure of the gun manufacturing lobbies like the National Rifle Association.The \"Occupy Wall Street\" Movement is another example that depicts citizens' outcry against the economic inequality, disparities, corporate greed, and use of money in politics as well as complete dissatisfaction with entities that are largely granted financial advantages by lawmakers but fail to deliver the promised prosperity to ordinary citizens.This growing frustration has been skillfully exploited by Trump to gain support for his campaign, adopting the slogan \"Make America Great Again\" (MAGA). He promises voters that he will bring back investments and the jobs that were outsourced abroad and will impose high tariffs to achieve this goal. Trump further taps into this discontent by speaking about the \"deep state,\" claiming that his goal as President is to dismantle it because it has pursued policies that do not serve ordinary citizens. Thus, he calls on voters to support him so that he can restore their socio-economic rights. On the other hand, the Biden administration's stance regarding the war on Gaza, providing unconditional support to Israel with taxpayer money, has also deepened the lack of trust in state institutions and political actors, particularly among youth. The administration's actions in this regard are seen as a violation of international and U.S. law creating a moral crisis that is expected to cast a shadow over the upcoming presidential elections on November 5th and beyond.With just a few weeks remaining before Election Day, the day after remains open to several possibilities and questions that are expected to impact the dynamics within the political landscape and most importantly the democratic process in the United States. As such will the war on Gaza have a direct impact on the presidential election results in general, and on the Democratic Party in particular making it an unprecedented event in recent U.S. electoral history as foreign policy issues are often a low priority for American voters? And how will the Democratic Party handle this new variable to regain the trust of the voters it would have lost?Will increased voter abstention, especially among the youth, create a surprise in this election, given that those demanding a Cease-Fire in Gaza, particularly as the conflict has expanded to Lebanon, are expected to stay away from the ballot boxes, along with the undecided who are not convinced by the political offers of either party and reject the idea of voting for the \"lesser evil\"? And how will this abstention impact the election outcome?Will a third-party vote create a surprise this time and lead to the rise of the Green Party as another political entity that could break the binary nature of the U.S. political system and present an alternative to voters who no longer find appeal in the political platforms of Democrats and Republicans?Furthermore, in the event of Trump's win, to what extent will the pillars of the democratic system and its institutions withstand his authoritarian tendencies and the rise of his far-right supporters? And will such a scenario serve as a serious wake-up call for political and civil society actors in the U.S. to engage in a constructive dialogue about a range of pressing issues, such as electoral campaign financing, racial justice; electoral system, particularly the Electoral College; and the role of money and lobbies in the electoral process as well as its influence on public policies? And could this event lead to a revival of a \"Founding Fathers Moment\" aiming to foster a dialogue that would establish a new social contract that ensures social peace in the U.S., safeguard the public interest, and strengthen the country's democratic institutions to reaffirm their role to serve citizens and protect their rights?The Author's views don't reflect any institutional affiliation.Hashtags: #USAPresidentiaElections2024 #UncommittedMovement #Undecided Voters #ThreatsToDemocracy #ElectionIntegrity #CeaseFireinGazaNow #ThirdPartyVote #DemocracyInChallenge #KamalaHarris #DonaldTrump #polirazation #politicalviolence #Project 2025 #PopulistDiscourse #Racism #© Morocco World News.",

    "content": "By Katelyn Caralle, Senior U.S. Political Reporter In Washington, D.C.Kamala Harris is facing the ire of TIME's owner after she refused to sit for an interview with the renowned news magazine.The vice president has refused to sit for an interview with several legacy media outlets since taking over Joe Biden's campaign leading the Democratic 2024 presidential ticket and has faced a slew of criticism for her sparse media strategy.Marc Benioff wrote of his disappointment on X, claiming Time Magazine has reached out several times for an interview with the presidential nominee.'Despite multiple requests, TIME has not been granted an interview with Kamala Harris -- unlike every other Presidential candidate,' the owner posted on Sunday.Benioff included a link to interviews Time Magazine conducted with former President Donald Trump and President Biden when he was still running for reelection in 2024.Time owner Marc Benioff (pictured) is furious that Vice President Kamala Harris has declined repeated requests from the Magazine to sit for an interview before the 2024 presidential election'We believe in transparency and publish each interview in full,' he added in the post. 'Why isn't the Vice President engaging with the public on the same level?'Read More Kamala Harris poses for the Vogue cover in her Tiffany earrings in fawning magazine issueThe denouncement of Harris' refusal to interview with the magazine comes as CBS News faces intense backlash for favorably editing its 60 Minutes interview with the candidate.A Time article published on October 10 titled What Kind of President Would Kamala Harris Be? notes that the VP 'declined repeated requests for an interview for this story.''In contrast, Trump talked about his policy vision with a TIME reporter for 90 minutes across two interviews. Biden spoke to TIME at similar length before dropping out of the race,' they added in that article.Critics, especially pro-MAGA social media accounts, have brought into question Harris' media strategy ahead of the election.There are only 22 days until the election next month and Harris has not gone full court press on media appearances like most candidates tend to do in the runup to Election Day.VP Harris' media strategy has been brought into question by critics after she has snubbed a number of legacy and traditional media outlets in favor of more alternative outlets - like the raunchy, sex-focused Call Her Daddy podcastThe VP has engaged in some questionable interviews, like with the raunchy and sex-focused podcast Call Her Daddy.

    "title": "MIL-OSI Global: A devastating hurricane doesn't dramatically change how people vote - but in...",
    "content": "Source: The Conversation - USA - By Boris Heersink, Associate Professor of Political Science, Fordham UniversityThe recovery in both states is expected to extend far beyond the November 2024 election period. The majority of the people in the affected communities in North Carolina and Florida voted for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in 2020, making some election analysts wonder if some Trump supporters will be able to cast their ballots.Amy Lieberman, a politics and society editor at The Conversation U.S., spoke with Boris Heersink, a scholar of voters' behavior after a natural disaster, to better understand if and how the recent hurricanes could shift the results of the 2024 presidential election.A massive hurricane disrupts people's lives in many important ways, including affecting people's personal safety and where they can live. Ahead of an election, there are a lot of practical limitations about how an election can be executed - like if a person can still receive mail-in ballots at home or elsewhere, or if it is possible to still vote in person at their polling location if that building was destroyed or damaged.Another issue is whether people who have just lived through a natural disaster and will likely be dealing with the aftermath for weeks to come are focused on politics right now. Some might sit out the election because they simply have more important things to worry about.The other side of the equation, which is what political scientists like myself are mostly focusing on, is whether people take the fact that a natural disaster happened into consideration when they vote.Two scholars, Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels, have argued that sometimes voters are not great at figuring out how to incorporate bad things that happened to them into a voting position. In some cases, it is entirely fair to hold an elected official responsible for bad outcomes that affect people's lives. But at other moments, bad things can happen to us without that being the fault of an incumbent president or governor. And voters should ideally be able to balance out these different types of bad things - those it is fair to punish elected officials for, and those for which it isn't fair to hold them responsible.After all, a devastating hurricane is terrible, but it is not Kamala Harris' fault that it happened. But Achen and Bartels argue that voters frequently still punish elected officials for random bad events like this.Their most famous example is the consequences of a series of shark attacks off the New Jersey coast in the summer of 1916. As a result of those attacks, the New Jersey tourism industry saw a major decline. While these findings are still being debated, Achen and Bartels argue that Jersey shore voters subsequently voted against Woodrow Wilson in the 1916 presidential election at a higher rate than they would have had the shark attacks not happened. They argue that voters did this even though Wilson had no involvement in the shark attacks.Scholars like John Gasper and Andrew Reeves argue that voters mostly care whether elected officials respond appropriately to a disaster. So, if the president does a good job reacting, voters do not actually punish them at all in the next election. However, voters can punish elected officials if they feel like the response is not correct.The fact that Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana in 2005 was not the fault of then-President George W. Bush. But the perceived slowness of the government response is something a voter could have held him responsible for.Colleagues and I have shown that how people interpret the combination of a disaster and the government response is likely colored by their own partisanship.We looked at both the effects of Superstorm Sandy on the 2012 presidential election and natural disasters' impact on elections more broadly from 1972 through 2004. One core finding is that when presidents reject state officials' disaster declaration requests, they lose votes in affected counties - but only if those counties were already more supportive of the opposite party.If there is a strong positive government response, the incumbent president or their party can actually gain votes or lose voters affected by a disaster. So, Republicans affected by the hurricanes could become more inclined to vote against Harris if they feel like they are not getting the help they need. But it could also help Harris if affected Democrats feel like they are getting enough aid.The major takeaway is that if the government responds really effectively to a natural disaster or other emergency, there is not a huge electoral penalty - and there could even be a small reward.That is not irrelevant in a close election. If Republicans in affected areas in North Carolina feel the government response has been poor and it inspires them to turn out in higher numbers to punish Harris, that could matter. But if they feel like the response has been adequate, research suggests either no real effect on their support for Harris - or possibly even an increase in Harris voters.Scholars mostly assume that people affected can tell whether the government response was good or not. Trump and other Republicans are falsely saying that the response is slow and falsely claiming that Federal Emergency Management Agency money is being spent on immigrants who are not living in the country legally. There does not appear to be a slow government response to the hurricane in North Carolina, and there's no evidence the response is insufficient in Florida, either.So, the question now is whether voters affected by these hurricanes will respond based on their actual lived experiences, or how they are told they are living their experience.Boris Heersink receives funding from the Russell Sage Foundation.",
