After his loss, Trump maintained that the election was stolen from him and that he'd actually won over Joe Biden.\n\nSoon after, Pro-Trump insurrectionists attacked the US Capitol in an attempted coup on January 6, 2021, that left four dead. Trump has denied responsibility for the January 6 insurrection and publicly condemned it as a \"heinous attack\" that left him \"outraged by the violence, lawlessness, and mayhem.\"\n\nThe 2024 presidential election, in which Trump seeks to reclaim the presidency against Vice President Kamala Harris, is now less than a month away.\n\nThe question of whether Trump will accept the results of this election remains unclear. In May, Trump said he'd accept the results if \"everything's honest.\" A month later, at the first debate with President Joe Biden, he was unwilling to say if he would accept the results or not. In August, he told CBS News he would accept the results if they were \"fair and free.\"\n\nIn a recent interview promoting \"The Apprentice,\" Abbasi, who has been studying Trump since he signed on to make the film in 2018, weighed in on whether he believes Trump will accept the results in the event of a loss.\n\n\"I saw, like everyone else, what happened on January 6, which was horrific,\" he told Business Insider. \"And I have a feeling that a lot of people got away with insane stuff. Look at that footage.\"\n\n\"When you see that, you think, why would they change their opinion about this election? Why would they magically accept this when they didn't accept that?\" Abbasi continued.\n\n\"But somehow, I'm an optimist,\" he added. \"I was optimistic when people told me not to do this movie, or when people said no one would buy this movie. So, I really hope that everyone learned their lesson on January 6th. I hope to think that even though people may be tempted to do that again, they know what the consequences are, and they don't do it.\"\n\nIn August 2023, Trump was indicted on four charges in connection to January 6, including conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction or an attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights. A year later, the four counts were revised to remove some of the alleged conduct that may now be protected by presidential immunity. Trump has pleaded not guilty.\n\nAfter interviewing Abbasi, Business Insider reached out to Trump for comment. A spokesperson for the former president slammed the movie.\n\n\"This 'film' is pure malicious defamation, should never see the light of day, and doesn't even deserve a place in the straight-to-DVD section of a bargain bin at a soon-to-be-closed discount movie store,\" Trump communications director Steven Cheung said in a statement. \"It belongs in a dumpster fire.\"","image":"https://i.insider.com/66515e8ca961b37edf39fea8?width=1200&format=jpeg","eventUri":"eng-9987307","sentiment":-0.2314,"wgt":466625492,"relevance":1,"source_uri":"businessinsider.com","source_dataType":"news","source_title":"Business Insider","author_uri":"jason_guerrasio@businessinsider.com","author_name":"Jason Guerrasio","author_type":"author","author_isAgency":false},{"uri":"8363385989","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2024-10-14","time":"18:06:46","dateTime":"2024-10-14T18:06:46Z","dateTimePub":"2024-10-14T18:05:55Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.6275,"url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/3188387/harris-conduct-first-fox-news-interview-bret-baier/","title":"Harris to conduct first Fox News sit-down interview with Bret Baier - Washington Examiner","body":"The news of Harris's first sit-down interview with the network comes as the 2024 presidential election is in less than a month, with both candidates seeking to shore up their support ahead of Election Day.

Trump, meanwhile, has turned down the opportunity to do a 60 Minutes interview, instead doing interviews on The Hugh Hewitt Show and a number of other podcasts.\n\nOn the same day of Harris's interview with Baier, Fox News will also air a town hall with Trump featuring a women-only audience, which will be moderated by network anchor Harris Faulkner.

Kennedy Jr., Trump is poised to add a majority of his backers, according to a new survey provided to Secrets.\n\nThe groups that polled for and backed Kennedy, American Values '24 and John Zogby Strategies, released a survey that said Trump holds a 22-point lead over Harris among Kennedy's supporters.\n\nIn five of the six battleground states, Kennedy supporters prefer Trump over Harris by 20 points to 39 points.\n\n\"This means that the Kennedy Cohort will play a decisive factor in determining the eventual winner of the 2024 presidential election,\" said a Kennedy associate.\n\nIn August, Kennedy dropped out of the presidential race and said he had no clear path to victory. At the time, some 7% of voters supported his campaign, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nHe then endorsed Trump's candidacy and has indicated he would accept a key position in a second Trump administration.\n\nIn choosing to back Trump, Kennedy rejected his family's Democratic Party legacy after they spent much of the campaign criticizing him as a gadfly and spoiler. Liberals also mocked Kennedy's questioning of COVID-19 policies.\n\n\"This comprehensive poll shows RFK Jr. continues to play a major role in our political landscape after suspending his one-and-a-half-year tenure in the thick of the political arena,\" said Jeremy Zogby, managing partner of John Zogby Strategies.\n\n\"Democrat-leaning journalists have asked me how they could pick up a critical mass of his support. I tell them they should start by taking Kennedy more seriously. The DNC may have made a big mistake by not taking him more seriously,\" he told Secrets.\n\nIn the new John Zogby Strategies survey, 56% of Kennedy's supporters backed Trump, while Harris won 34%. A third of Kennedy's backers were \"not yet voting for Trump\" but would be \"open\" to supporting him.\n\nWhile this might not have a big impact nationally, it does in the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\n\nSEE THE LATEST POLITICAL NEWS AND BUZZ FROM WASHINGTON SECRETS\n\nAV24 and John Zogby Strategies provided Secrets with a graphic showing that \"bump\" of support:","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Trump-RFK-Election-scaled.webp","sentiment":0.2471,"wgt":466624589,"relevance":1,"source_uri":"washingtonexaminer.com","source_dataType":"news","source_title":"Washington Examiner","author_uri":"paul_bedard@washingtonexaminer.com","author_name":"Paul Bedard","author_type":"author","author_isAgency":false},{"uri":"8363366142","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2024-10-14","time":"17:47:44","dateTime":"2024-10-14T17:47:44Z","dateTimePub":"2024-10-14T17:47:30Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.5882,"url":"https://fortune.com/2024/10/14/harris-vs-trump-polls-predictit-polymarket-election-odds/","title":"Harris-Trump polls tighten, but PredictIt and Polymarket tell a different story","body":"But prediction markets tell a different story. PredictIt shows Trump's campaign in the lead as the 2024 presidential election winner. It also has the GOP winning the presidency and the electoral college margin. As of Monday afternoon, Polymarket, a cryptocurrency-based prediction marketplace, also shows Trump has a better chance of winning the election on Nov. 5.\n\nWhile prediction markets have been around for a while, they've grown in popularity -- especially for political events. These betting sites allow traders to buy and sell shares on the outcome of a given event, like whether Trump will get impeached or Biden will leave the presidential race.\n\nTraders then buy shares depending on which outcome they think is more likely. Share prices or \"odds\" rise and fall depending on demand. If the event happens the way the trader predicted, the contract or \"bet\" will rise to $1 and pay out -- or fall to $0 if it does not.\n\nPrediction markets can be a more sophisticated and accurate way to foresee political events, Thomas Miller, a data scientist at Northwestern University, told Fortune's Shawn Tully. Miller is renowned for his accurate predictions during the 2020 election, and much of his methodology comes from examining prediction markets.\n\n\"Political betting sites are the best at predicting the wisdom of the crowd,\" he told Fortune.\n\nWhile polls tell you about how people responded in the recent past, the odds on sites like PredictIt and Polymarket show real-time sentiment and are better for mapping the future, according to Miller. Plus, polls don't show who will win the electoral college, while traders on prediction markets can wager on its outcome.\n\nThree national polls released Sunday show Harris's lead is slimming.\n\nLast month, an ABC/Ipsos poll of likely voters showed Harris with a six-point lead over Trump. But that gap has closed to 50% support for Harris to 48% for Trump. A CBS/YouGov poll shows Harris up 51% to 48%, down from a four-point lead last month. And NBC's poll of registered voters shows a complete tie between Harris and Trump, both at 48%.\n\n\"As summer has turned to fall, any signs of momentum for Kamala Harris have stopped,\" Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff, told NBC. \"The race is a dead heat.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Polymarket shows Trump has a 54% chance of winning the presidential election with Harris trailing behind at just a 45.3% chance.\n\nPredictIt's markets are a little closer. For the market called \"Who will win the 2024 US presidential election?\" the \"yes\" outcome for Trump is currently at $0.54 and the \"yes\" outcome for Harris is $0.50.\n\n\"If you wanted a single best predictor, one source of information to know what's going on in the elections, it's the prediction market,\" Harry Crane, a statistics professor at Rutgers University, told CNN. \"Any given piece of information that you might have, such as a poll or an aggregator, or news, or a pundit's opinion, all of that is being combined in the participant's markets who have an incentive to get it right and to make money off of it.\"\n\nBut if prediction markets are as accurate as some experts say, why would there be such a discrepancy with what polls are showing? It comes down to what each is measuring, Ryan Waite, vice president of public affairs at public affairs consultancy Think Big, told Fortune.\n\n\"Polls tell us how voters feel right now, while prediction markets attempt to predict what will happen in the future,\" he said. \"Prediction markets are quicker to respond to new information, such as economic shifts or debate performances, while polls take time to update.\"\n\nBut prediction markets aren't perfect, Waite said, explaining that they can be manipulated by someone with a lot of money who wants to sway perception and that they aren't always accessible to everyone.\n\nStill, polls have issues of their own, including sampling bias, leading questioning, and non-responses that can also produce inaccuracies. That's why -- at least for now -- using both polls and prediction markets can help us understand future political events.\n\n\"While prediction markets are gaining traction, they're not going to replace traditional polling anytime soon,\" Waite said. \"They provide a complementary perspective. Polls help us understand how different voter segments feel about candidates or issues, while prediction markets can provide a dynamic view of how the broader public thinks things will play out. Together, they give a fuller picture of the political landscape.\"","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2171250794-e1728925989967.jpg?resize=1200,600","eventUri":"rus-1748336","sentiment":0.4039,"wgt":466624064,"relevance":12,"source_uri":"fortune.com","source_dataType":"news","source_title":"Fortune","author_uri":"sydney_lake@fortune.com","author_name":"Sydney Lake","author_type":"author","author_isAgency":false},{"uri":"8363364952","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":true,"date":"2024-10-14","time":"17:46:34","dateTime":"2024-10-14T17:46:34Z","dateTimePub":"2024-10-14T17:46:22Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://ca.news.yahoo.com/ali-abbasi-says-available-talk-173000376.html","title":"Ali Abbasi Says He's 'Available to Talk' After Donald Trump Rips 'The Apprentice' as a 'Hatchet Job'","body":"\"The Apprentice\" director Ali Abbasi is here to talk if you need to, Donald Trump.\n\nAbbasi has weathered numerous digs from the former president, including a threatened lawsuit.

Though Fillmore's efforts temporarily averted conflict, his administration's policies on slavery and sectionalism left a complicated legacy.\n\nFillmore's rise in politics\n\nMillard Fillmore was born on January 7, 1800, in a log cabin in Moravia, New York, to Nathaniel and Phoebe Fillmore. The second of nine children, Fillmore grew up in a poor farming family and had little formal education.\n\nHowever, he was determined to rise above his humble beginnings, and through self-study, he became a teacher and later an apprentice to a lawyer. By 1823, Fillmore was admitted to the New York State Bar, and he began practising law in East Aurora, New York.\n\nFillmore entered politics in the late 1820s as a member of the Anti-Masonic Party, an early third party in American politics. In 1832, he was elected to the New York State Assembly, where he gained a reputation as a moderate and pragmatic legislator.\n\nBy the mid-1830s, Fillmore had aligned himself with the Whig Party, which opposed the policies of US President Andrew Jackson.\n\nFillmore in the spotlight\n\nFillmore was elected to the US House of Representatives in 1833, where he served for eight years. During his time in Congress, he became an advocate for economic modernisation, supporting tariffs to protect American industry and federal funding for infrastructure projects such as roads and canals.\n\nHe also played a significant role in the creation of the US Treasury Department, co-authoring legislation that established the department in 1841.\n\nAfter leaving Congress, Fillmore served as New York's comptroller, where he worked to reform the state's financial system. His success in this role boosted his standing within the Whig Party, and in 1848, he was chosen as the vice-presidential candidate on a ticket with General Zachary Taylor.\n\nThe Compromise of 1850 and sectional tensions\n\nFillmore became president on July 9, 1850, following the death of US President Zachary Taylor, who had served just 16 months in office. As president, Fillmore inherited the nation's growing divide over the issue of slavery, particularly in the newly acquired territories from the Mexican-American War.\n\nOne of Fillmore's most consequential acts as president was his support for the Compromise of 1850, a package of five laws aimed at resolving the status of slavery in the territories.\n\nThe compromise included the admission of California as a free state, the establishment of territorial governments in New Mexico and Utah without restrictions on slavery, and the abolition of the slave trade in Washington DC.\n\nIt also included the controversial Fugitive Slave Act, which required that escaped enslaved people be returned to their owners, even if they had reached free states.\n\nWhile the Compromise of 1850 temporarily calmed sectional tensions, the Fugitive Slave Act sparked widespread outrage in the North, where abolitionists viewed it as a betrayal of their values.\n\nFillmore's enforcement of the law alienated many Northern Whigs, contributing to the eventual collapse of the party.\n\nFillmore opens relations with Japan\n\nFillmore's presidency also saw several notable foreign policy initiatives. He opened relations with Japan, dispatching Commodore Matthew Perry on a mission to establish trade with the isolationist nation.\n\nPerry's mission ultimately resulted in the Treaty of Kanagawa in 1854, which marked the beginning of formal relations between the US and Japan.\n\nDomestically, Fillmore supported internal improvements, including expanding the nation's railroad system and improving harbours and waterways. He also presided over the admission of California as a state and the expansion of territories in the American West.\n\nPost-presidency Fillmore\n\nFillmore's decision to support the Compromise of 1850, particularly the Fugitive Slave Act, made him unpopular with many in the North, and he failed to secure the Whig Party's nomination for the 1852 election. After leaving the presidency in 1853, Fillmore retired to Buffalo, New York.\n\nIn 1856, Fillmore returned to the national stage as the presidential candidate for the American Party, also known as the \"Know-Nothing\" Party, which was focused on nativist and anti-immigrant policies.\n\nHe finished third in the election, behind Democrat James Buchanan and Republican John C Frémont.\n\nFillmore largely retired from public life after his defeat in 1856. He continued to serve his community in Buffalo, engaging in charitable and educational activities, and was involved in the founding of the University at Buffalo.\n\nMillard Fillmore's legacy\n\nMillard Fillmore's presidency is often viewed as one of compromise and moderation during a period of increasing sectional tension.\n\nHis support for the Compromise of 1850, particularly the Fugitive Slave Act, has been criticised for enabling the expansion of slavery and deepening the divide between North and South.\n\nWhile his foreign policy initiatives, such as opening relations with Japan, are seen as successful, Fillmore is generally regarded as a president who struggled to navigate the complex and divisive issues of his time.\n\nHe remains a somewhat overlooked figure in American history, often overshadowed by the more prominent leaders who followed him in the lead-up to the Civil War.","image":"https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/10/Millard-Fillmore-1-Reuters-2024-10-c557425c741cf437364b8d9768822294.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)","sentiment":0.0431,"wgt":466623288,"relevance":1,"source_uri":"firstpost.com","source_dataType":"news","source_title":"Firstpost"},{"uri":"8363351936","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2024-10-14","time":"17:34:23","dateTime":"2024-10-14T17:34:23Z","dateTimePub":"2024-10-14T17:33:24Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.democraticunderground.com/100219565876","title":"NC Polls: The decent polls, (ignore the winger polls) have Harris tied or only down 1 point","body":"https://www.270towin.com/2024-presidential-election-polls/north-carolina\n\nThe more reliable polls are GSG, Highpoint, Cook and Quinnipiac.

To help better understand the way America picks its president and its leaders -- all the way down the ballot -- we're publishing a series aimed at assisting readers in making sense of the American democracy.\n\nRead on for more about Election Day 2024:\n\nHere are the top 25 must-know people, places, races, dates and more. Consider it a guidebook, of sorts, to American democracy as it nears its 250th birthday.\n\nElections 2024: Top 25 must-know people, races, dates and more\n\nGlitches have occurred throughout the history of U.S. elections. Yet election workers across America have consistently pulled off presidential elections and accurately tallied the results -- and there's no reason to believe this year will be any different.\n\nNot everything will run perfectly on Election Day. Still, US elections are remarkably reliable\n\nElection night is a bit like a jigsaw puzzle, except that only one piece appears at a time, and you don't get to look at the picture on the box. As thousands of counties and towns report vote totals, it can be hard to figure out when the results reported so far will reflect the outcome. Past elections can provide a guide.\n\nWant to follow election results like a pro? Here's what to watch in key states\n\nThe Constitution sets out broad principles for electing a national government and leaves the details to the states. The choices made by state lawmakers and election officials as they sort out those details affect everything from how voters cast a ballot, how quickly the tabulation and release of results takes place, how elections are kept secure and how officials maintain voters' confidence in the process.\n\nFlorida has nearly all ballots counted on Election Day, while California can take weeks. This is why\n\nIt may be no surprise that people seek certainty before elections happen, given what they see as the stakes: One recent poll found that about 7 in 10 Americans believe that the future of democracy is at stake in this year's presidential election. Yet often the forecasters themselves are the first to push back on the characterization that they can tell you what's going to happen.\n\nHow elections forecasters became political 'prophets'\n\nIf you want to cast a ballot on Election Day or vote by mail, it helps to know the rules.\n\nWho can vote in US elections, and what steps must you take to do so?\n\nVoting before Election Day is much more common today than it was roughly 50 years ago. Yet it is highly politicized as voting in the 2024 presidential election is already underway.\n\nHow voting before Election Day became so widespread and so political\n\nIn a closely contested presidential election, as many expect 2024 to be, the results in a few bellwether counties in the key battleground states are likely to decide the outcome, just as they did in the past two general elections. Here's a look at those that might matter the most on Election Day:\n\nWhere are the voters who could decide the presidential election?\n\nThe U.S. general election on Nov. 5 will decide the country's direction, but it is far from a nationally administered contest. The 50 states and the District of Columbia run their own elections, and each does things a little differently.\n\nNot all elections look the same. Here are some of the different ways states run their voting\n\nAn uncommon system of voting could be central to which party controls the U.S. House this fall -- or even the presidency. In Maine and Alaska, voters in competitive congressional districts will elect a winner using ranked choice voting. Here's how it works:\n\nRanked choice voting could decide which party controls the US House. How does it work?\n\nVoter fraud does happen occasionally. When it does, we tend to hear a lot about it. It also gets caught and prosecuted. The nation's multilayered election processes provide many safeguards that keep voter fraud generally detectable and rare, according to current and former election administrators of both parties.\n\nYes, voter fraud happens. But it's rare and election offices have safeguards to catch it\n\nElection officials rely on various pieces of technology. Every office does things a little bit differently. In November's presidential election, nearly every ballot cast will have a paper record that can be used to obtain an accurate count even if there are errors or cyberattacks.\n\nVoting systems have been under attack since 2020, but are tested regularly for accuracy and security\n\nControversies over hand counting have flared periodically in pockets of the country before the 2024 presidential election, even though research has shown that it is more prone to error, costlier and likely to delay results.\n\nElection conspiracy theories fueled a push to hand-count votes, but doing so is risky and slow\n\nFeeds and live videos streaming from election sites across the country are an effort by election officials to demystify voting and provide greater transparency to a process that in recent years has been subject to intense scrutiny, misinformation and false claims of widespread fraud.\n\nOn a screen near you: Officials are livestreaming the election process for more transparency\n\nAmerica's court system has no formal role in the election process, and judges generally try not to get involved because they don't want to be seen as interfering or shaping a partisan outcome, said Paul Schiff Berman, a professor at George Washington University Law School. But election disputes have increasingly landed in court since Bush v. Gore, Berman said.\n\nCourts could see wave of election lawsuits, but experts say bar to change outcome is high\n\nThe presidential race is competitive. That's about as much as the national polls can tell us right now, even if it looks like Democrat Kamala Harris is down in one poll or Republican Donald Trump is up in another.\n\nWill the polls be right in 2024? What polling on the presidential race can and can't tell you\n\nChances are, you have never been contacted for an election poll. But the dozens of high-quality election polls that will be released before Election Day represent a reasonable estimate of the opinions of all Americans.\n\nHow a poll can represent your opinion even if you weren't contacted for it\n\nThe Electoral College is the unique American system of electing presidents. It is different from the popular vote, and it has an outsize impact on how candidates run and win campaigns.\n\nWhat is the Electoral College and how does the US use it to elect presidents?\n\nIt's election night, the polls have closed and chances are you're waiting on one of the major television networks to say who will be the next president. But why does the news media play that role in the first place? Shouldn't that be the government's job? Here's a brief history:\n\nNews media don't run elections. Why do they call the winners?\n\nFor the outcome of this year's presidential race, it will be the vote count on election night and possibly in the days after that will grab the public's attention. But those numbers are unofficial until the election is formally certified -- a once uneventful process that has become politicized since then-President Trump tried to overturn his reelection loss four years ago.\n\nElection certification is a traditionally routine duty that has become politicized in the Trump era\n\nWith the American electorate so evenly divided, there will be elections in November close enough that officials will have to recount the votes. Just don't expect those recounts to change the winner. They rarely do, even when the margins are tiny.","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2175666523.jpg?w=640","eventUri":"eng-9987709","sentiment":0.1216,"wgt":466622000,"relevance":12,"source_uri":"mercurynews.com","source_dataType":"news","source_title":"San Jose Mercury News","author_uri":"associated_press@mercurynews.com","author_name":"Associated Press","author_type":"author","author_isAgency":true},{"uri":"8363328991","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2024-10-14","time":"17:13:03","dateTime":"2024-10-14T17:13:03Z","dateTimePub":"2024-10-14T17:12:47Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://thenewsguru.com/news/trump-demands-cognitive-test-for-kamala-harris-in-fiery-x-outburst/","title":"Trump demands cognitive test for Kamala Harris","body":"Trump demands cognitive test for Kamala Harris in fiery X outburstFormer U.S President Donald Trump has demanded that Vice President Kamala Harris undergo a test for cognitive stamina and agility, igniting a fierce debate over her mental acuity and the integrity of the media.\n\nTaking to social media, Trump expressed his concerns, asserting, \"Her actions have led many to believe that there could be something very wrong with her.\"\n\nThe provocative statement comes on the heels of a contentious media appearance by Harris, during which Trump alleged that CBS and 60 minutes attempted to shield her by \"illegally and unscrupulously\" replacing a controversial answer with a response unrelated to the original question.\n\nTrump's tirade, laden with his trademark hyperbole, accused Harris of being \"slow and lethargic\" in her responses, claiming that even the simplest inquiries leave her fumbling for answers.\n\n\"We just went through almost four years of that; we shouldn't have to do it again!\" he exclaimed, evoking memories of his own tumultuous presidency.\n\nThe former president's comments have set off a political firestorm, with supporters rallying around his call for transparency, while opponents vehemently defend Harris's competence and ability to serve in her role.\n\nPolitical analysts speculate that Trump's incendiary remarks may be part of a broader strategy to galvanise his base ahead of the 2024 presidential election, while also serving to divert attention from his own legal challenges.\n\nAs the political landscape grows increasingly polarized, the fallout from Trump's statement is sure to resonate in the weeks to come, prompting discussions around cognitive testing, media accountability, and the implications of political rhetoric in the current climate.\n\nThe White House has yet to respond officially to Trump's accusations, but Harris's supporters remain steadfast, insisting that her capability as vice president is beyond question.\n\nThe debate has intensified, with both sides preparing for an escalating war of words as the nation approaches a pivotal election year.\n\nIn a climate charged with tension and division, Trump's latest remarks underscore the deepening rift within American politics, leaving many to wonder how far this battle for the narrative will go.","image":"https://thenewsguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/trump.webp","sentiment":-0.0353,"wgt":466621983,"relevance":1,"source_uri":"thenewsguru.com","source_dataType":"news","source_title":"TheNewsGuru","author_uri":"caleb_ishaya@thenewsguru.com","author_name":"Caleb Ishaya","author_type":"author","author_isAgency":false},{"uri":"8363327138","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2024-10-14","time":"17:11:42","dateTime":"2024-10-14T17:11:42Z","dateTimePub":"2024-10-14T17:11:03Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.8078,"url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-view-donald-trump-sunny-hostin-1968749","title":"'The View' hosts deliver message to Kamala Harris: 'Ratchet up fear factor'","body":"With only 22 days remaining until the 2024 Presidential Election, The View co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin urged the Harris campaign to \"ratchet up the fear factor.\"\n\n\"I think they need to better utilize surrogates,\" Griffin said during Monday's episode. \"For example, if we consider the young white male voters Trump is targeting, they should have Josh Shapiro appear on Joe Rogan, or have billionaire Jamie Pritzker engage with the Barstool Sports crowd to discuss why their vision is more aspirational. They need to leave nothing on the table in this final stretch.\"\n\nA new national poll released Sunday by NBC News showed Trump in a \"dead heat\" with Harris, with the two candidates tied, each with 48 percent support among registered voters. Notably, that's a 4-point boost for Trump compared to NBC News' September poll, and a 1-point decline for Harris.\n\nSunny Hostin disagrees, asserting Harris has run a 'flawless' campaign, having raised a billion dollars. She believes the press shares some of the blame, pointing out CNN reports Democrats are feeling anxious, Axios highlights the \"blue wall blues,\" and FOX claims they are \"scared to death.\"\n\n\"Dems are not scared to death, Dems are pumped,\" Hostin said. \"What I would like the press to talk a little bit more about is Trump is in hiding. He didn't do the 60 Minutes interview. He does not want to do another debate.

However, when originally asked, \"If anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?\" Kamala responded, \"Not a thing comes to mind.\"\n\nGriffin said Republicans are ahead of Democrats in registering new voters in crucial battleground states, which could be pivotal. She also highlighted the importance of change, stating the public is shifting against Biden's policies, regardless of personal opinions about him.\n\nHostin fired back stating, statistically, the Biden administration has been one of the most effective in recent history.\n\nThe group also discussed Trump's refusal to release his medical information, calling out Republicans as hypocrites for demanding the same from Biden just a few months ago.\n\nHostin said all we're receiving is a comprehensive report from seven years ago.\n\n\"He had high cholesterol. That concerns me,\" Hostin said. \"He was overweight, obviously, and he had rosacea. I don't know if I care about that as much, but that's the most information that we have about the man that wants to be next to the nuclear codes.\"\n\nShe also said Trump's erratic speaking style suggests dementia or cognitive decline, as he often rambles and jumps from topic to topic. However, he refers to this style as \"weaving.\"\n\nAna Navarro chimed in with a joke, suggesting Trump's bronzer color is also a sign of dementia, saying, \"If he gets any darker, he's gonna have to deport himself.\"","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2494907/harris.webp","eventUri":"eng-9993038","sentiment":0.0745,"wgt":466621902,"relevance":1,"source_uri":"newsweek.com","source_dataType":"news","source_title":"Newsweek","author_uri":"courtney_mcginley@newsweek.com","author_name":"Courtney McGinley","author_type":"author","author_isAgency":false},{"uri":"8363325473","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2024-10-14","time":"17:10:06","dateTime":"2024-10-14T17:10:06Z","dateTimePub":"2024-10-14T17:09:52Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.southernstar.ie/premium-exclusives/letters-to-the-editor-too-difficult-to-call-outcome-of-crucial-us-election-4308445","title":"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR: Too difficult to call outcome of crucial US election | The Southern Star","body":"EDITOR - The 2024 US presidential election is the most crucial in years. We learned in 2016 that polls are not a guaranteed indicator when Donald Trump was a shock winner. He didn't expect to win and had no proper transition team ready.\n\nPast US presidential election wins were more predictable, but some of them had seriously underhand dealings. Watergate is one of two examples when a few of the Republican and Democrat party members succumbed to unethical behaviour.\n\nThe first example is the Watergate break-in into the Democrat Party's office in the Watergate apartment complex in Washington DC to steal their election plans for the US election in 1972.\n\nThe burglars were caught on the spot by security guards and it led to Republican US president Richard Nixon having to resign two years later, because of his attempted cover-up of the break-in. The 50th anniversary of his resignation was this year.\n\nThe break-in was unnecessary as Nixon won his second term in 1972 by a landslide and already had huge support from the American voters. His insecurity as to whether he would win was a factor in the break-in. He previously lost the 1960 US election to JFK by a narrow margin.\n\nThe men who were caught trying to break in to the Watergate complex were found guilty. President Nixon resigned or he would have been impeached and forced to resign. His successor, vice-president Gerald Ford was not involved in any way in the break-in. He pardoned him to bring it to a dignified end.\n\nThe second example is when a decade before, the Democrats broke into the Republican Party election offices before the 1964 US presidential election. Their operatives stole election plans of the Republican candidate, Barry Goldwater.\n\nThe difference between the two break-ins is their burglars were not caught.\n\nAnother unnecessary break-in. Barry Goldwater did not have national support. President Lyndon Johnson was sure to win. He did by a landslide with sympathy from voters for the Democrat Party after the assassination and loss to the country of his predecessor JFK, the previous year.\n\nJohnson had similar insecurities to Nixon about popularity. This time, few can predict the outcome of the US presidential election on November 5th.\n\nEDITOR - The situation here in Lebanon is extremely concerning and getting worse each day. Frightening and sleepless nights due to frequent bombing is the new normal for everyone, including us humanitarian workers.\n\nIt is truly terrifying to live in a city where anywhere can be attacked at any time. The country is witnessing its largest displacement crisis in history due to the ongoing conflict with over 1.2m people seeking refuge from the conflict.\n\nThe impact of the ongoing hostilities on displaced populations has been immense. Many have lost their homes and loved ones. They are exhausted. People hitchhike for days to try to reach safer locations elsewhere in the country.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people are now camping and sleeping outside in the streets or in parks and on beaches. People are in urgent need of shelters and also basic items like blankets, mattresses, pillows and soap.\n\nMore and more people are arriving each day after fleeing their homes. Many people are sleeping on floors with no mattresses. Vulnerable groups such as pregnant women and newborn children require specialised support.\n\nConcern are on the ground receiving and supporting as many families as we can, but there are huge gaps in the availability of critical services to respond to the ever-increasing overcrowding. The lack of resources will only get worse too as the conflict is further exacerbated.\n\nI would like to call upon the Irish community who are known for their compassion and generosity to come forward in this hour of extreme hardship and support our appeal to help the families, children, elderly and everyone displaced in this crisis.\n\nEDITOR - There has been no action on the road - no action whatsoever on the problem with the school buses so the children can get to school.\n\nWhat does it take for the government to be involved in what they are supposed to? They are perfectly able to build an exorbitantly-priced bicycle stand and they can ignore the disaster of a children's hospital price. I'm afraid to ask, what have I missed?\n\nSince I have lived here there have been constant repairs, in spots, on the N71.\n\nSkibbereen was tantalised with a scheme to improve the centre of town. That was a year ago. Perhaps the new footpath on Bridge Street is part of that. But oh please, we need paint! Actually, I would applaud anything that would involve something for our teenagers. A cinema, a bowling area, a swimming pool. What will happen when all the kids move away? Then where is the town going? Wrong word, as it is definitely not going anywhere. Here we are, an Olympic gold medal town ... can we not stand up and be counted?\n\nWouldn't it be something if people said 'wow' when they visited?\n\nWhat a show of appreciation if we saw people taking pictures because they want to remember our town. For those of us who live here, it's the people that make the town, but if we want revenue and support for businesses, we need the visitors.\n\nAnd we need the visitors to talk about us because they are impressed with what they have seen.\n\nEDITOR - I was gobsmacked - to put it mildly - to hear last week that the Cork Business Association is going to pay shop owners to keep their lights on - for security reasons - in Cork city. I had to read it twice to be sure it wasn't a mistake - and then check the date that it wasn't April 1st.\n\nAre we really saying, at at time when every emphasis around us is on keeping energy consumption down, that money will be used to fund this hair-brained scheme?\n\nIf so, this money is being used to shore up the gaps left by a shortage of gardaí. If we had more gardaí patrolling the streets we wouldn't need a 'Leave a Light On' initiative.\n\nWe'll be a laughing stock with this kind of backwards attitude to energy - as the decent people of Ireland strive, every day, to save the planet.","image":"https://img.resized.co/southernstar/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2ltYWdlcy5zb3V0aGVybnN0YXIuaWVcXFwvdXBsb2Fkc1xcXC8yMDIxXFxcLzA0XFxcLzE2MTE1ODE0XFxcL0xldHRlcnNfdG9fZWRpdG9yLmpwZWdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6MTIwMCxcImhlaWdodFwiOjYzMCxcImRlZmF1bHRcIjpcImh0dHBzOlxcXC9cXFwvd3d3LnNvdXRoZXJuc3Rhci5pZVxcXC9pbWFnZXNcXFwvcGxhY2Vob2xkZXIucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjFhZmZiNjI4YTNkZWI0NzY1NWU4MmQyNWVjYzVmNjE4MjQ0YTIxN2UifQ==/letters-to-the-editor-too-difficult-to-call-outcome-of-crucial-us-election.jpeg","sentiment":-0.0196,"wgt":466621806,"relevance":1,"source_uri":"southernstar.ie","source_dataType":"news","source_title":"The Southern Star"},{"uri":"8363318420","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":true,"date":"2024-10-14","time":"17:04:27","dateTime":"2024-10-14T17:04:27Z","dateTimePub":"2024-10-14T17:03:58Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.dw.com/en/recommended-the-candidate-with-the-most-votes-may-not-win-the-us-presidential-election-the-countrys-democracy-is-certainly-a-quirky-one/a-69048494","title":"How democratic is the US really?","body":"When Americans elect their next president in November, the candidate with the most votes might not be the winner. Democracy in the US comes with some quirks -- and was under attack not so long ago. How is it faring today?\n\nFor a long time, the US viewed itself as an exemplary democracy: a country other nations could look to when building their own democracies after gaining independence or shedding authoritarian regimes.\n\nThat idea is manifested in the \"city upon a hill\" metaphor. Politicians from John F. Kennedy to Barack Obama have referred to the United States as a glowing beacon, drawing everyone's eyes. In 1961, President-elect Kennedy said the world was still looking to the US and its democracy and that \"our governments, in every branch, at every level, national, state and local, must be as a city upon a hill.\"\n\nOn January 6, 2021, the world's eyes were on the United States. That day, a mob of right-wing extremists, encouraged by then President Donald Trump, stormed the US Capitol in an attempt to interrupt the democratic transfer of power after the 2020 election.\n\nAnd, in a 2023 poll by the Associated Press news agency in cooperation with the University of Chicago, only 10% of participants said that democracy in the United States was working extremely or very well.\n\nSo what is the state of US democracy today, ahead of the 2024 presidential election?\n\n\"I think it's fair to say Americans don't have a lot of trust right now in governmental institutions,\" Michael Berkman, director of the McCourtney Institute for Democracy and a political science professor at Pennsylvania State University told DW. \"They're looking at a Congress that is not functioning well at all and they're looking at some rather intractable problems that government has not really addressed, like gun violence and climate change.\"\n\nWith their inability to choose a leader, the Republican majority in the House of Representatives paralyzed Congress for weeks in October 2023. But even without interruptions like this, getting any laws through both chambers of Congress -- the House and the Senate -- is slow going because of the deeply entrenched partisanship between Republicans and Democrats.\n\n\"It is extremely difficult, sometimes impossible, to pass legislation even when overwhelming majorities of the public support a measure,\" Vanessa Williamson, a senior fellow in governance studies at US think tank the Brookings Institution, told DW. \"There is very serious dysfunction in Washington.\"\n\nThe harsh polarization, the gulf between Democratic and Republican supporters, means that at least half the country is likely to be extremely unhappy with many decisions the elected government is making.\n\nAfter the 2020 elections, many Republicans (lead by Trump) were so unhappy with the election results that they tried to ignore them, falsely claiming the election was \"stolen\" from them so vehemently that eventually, a mob of those who believed it stormed the Capitol. A peaceful transition of power is one of the hallmarks of democracy, and that almost didn't happen in the US.\n\n\"I think what happened on January 6 and the refusal of one side to accept the results of the election is very damaging for a democracy, since accepting the outcome of an election is pretty much central to democratic politics,\" Berkman said.\n\nIt is not surprising then that trust in democratic institutions has gone down in recent years. But there's more you might not expect from a country like the US.\n\n\"In addition to the recent forms of democratic erosion, the United States has many anti-democratic practices of very long standing,\" Williamson said.\n\nChief among them: The winner of the presidential election is not necessarily the one with the most votes.\n\nMost recently, Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election even though his opponent, Hillary Clinton, garnered roughly 2.9 million more votes than him. The reason behind this conundrum is the electoral college. In the US, each of the 50 states has a certain number of electors depending on its population size. The candidate who wins the majority of the people's votes in a state is the one who gets the state's electoral votes. Sounds complicated? Here's an example.\n\nCalifornia as the most populous state has the most electors in the electoral college: 54. The candidate who can get the most Californians to vote for them will receive all 54 of these elector votes, even if they only won the popular vote in California by a narrow margin. Smaller states like Vermont or South Dakota only have three electoral college votes, but the system is the same.\n\nTo win the presidency, a candidate must win in enough states to bring his electoral college vote up to 270 electors or more. Someone who wins states by small margins can thus become president, even though more Americans in total voted for the other candidate.\n\nAnother part of the US political system that does not reflect a perfect democracy is the upper chamber of Congress: The US Senate. Each US state has two senators in the chamber -- no matter the state's population size.\n\nThat means in some states, one senator represents a few hundred thousand people, while in another, a couple of million people \"share\" a senator. When the Senate has a decision to make, each senator's vote holds exactly the same weight, even though they represent vastly different numbers of people.\n\nBerkman calls the Senate \"a deeply undemocratic institution.\" And Williamson says that as a result of the way the Senate is set up, \"our most populous regions are profoundly underrepresented in the legislative process.\"\n\nThe US might not be a model democracy, but Americans haven't given up on it. More people are getting involved.\n\nThe voter turnout in the 2020 presidential election stood at more than 65%, higher than it had been in more than 100 years.\n\n\"You see increased political participation over the last eight, 10 years,\" Berkman said. \"And I think that's important.\"","image":"https://static.dw.com/image/68397140_6.jpg","sentiment":0.098,"wgt":466621467,"relevance":1,"source_uri":"dw.com","source_dataType":"news","source_title":"Deutsche Welle"},{"uri":"8363299806","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2024-10-14","time":"16:48:12","dateTime":"2024-10-14T16:48:12Z","dateTimePub":"2024-10-14T16:47:39Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.postandcourier.com/arena/lifestyle/dennis-quaids-son-jacks-bold-political-message-resurfaces-after-famous-dads-strong-statement/article_625cfc79-1e8e-53d1-8943-a38a607c965c.html","title":"Dennis Quaid's Son Jack's Bold Political Message Resurfaces After Famous Dad's Strong Statement","body":"The 2024 presidential election is dividing families across the country -- including celebrity parents and kids.

The current Republican presidential candidate for the White House is coming out against Ali Bassi's The Apprentice, a film starring Sebastian Stan that sees the actor portraying Trump during his ascension as a real estate mogul under the tutelage of Roy Cohn (Jeremy Strong). The film opened over the weekend courtesy of Briarcliff Entertainment, and Trump is making it very clear that he has no nice feelings about the movie.\n\nTrump took to his Truth Social page and went in hard against The Apprentice, calling it \"A FAKE and CLASSLESS\" movie and suggesting the film was being released before the 2024 Presidential Election to \"hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country.\" Much of Trump's online tirade is typical of him and should be no surprise, especially since the project doesn't show him in the best possible light. Given it was the movie's opening weekend, the film is more relevant than ever, and Trump doesn't miss a chance to also be present in any news story where his name is mentioned.\n\nIt didn't take long for Abbasi to find out about Trump's post and the director soon took to his X page to release his own statement that thanked the presidential hopeful for getting back the film's movie team, saying that he's available to \"talk further if you want.\" However, in a bit of a cheeky response, Abbassi admitted to being busy with press for the film and said, \"But I might be able to give you a call tomorrow.\" So far, Trump hasn't responded to the director's recent post.\n\nThe Apprentice Debuted to Lackluster Numbers Over the Weekend Close\n\nThe Apprentice opened on 1,740 screens over the weekend, a respectable number for a film that once found it hard to find a distributor, but the movie was met with soft box office numbers, opening to just $1.58 million. Some people have made comments that the current presidential race has turned into quite a spectacle, so any film made about Trump, even if it doesn't touch on his current presidential aspirations, won't be as shocking or salacious as anything going on in his real life. Reviews for the film are good at 78% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, with an even more impressive 85% Popcornmeter that now measures audience reaction on the site. For those who have seen it, the response has appeared to be mostly positive, but being able to reach an audience that is on the fence about the film has been difficult so far.\n\nRelated The Apprentice Distributor Slams Networks as Cowards After Controversial Decision\n\nABC and CBS have made a decision regarding the upcoming Donald Trump biopic and the presidential debates.\n\n1\n\nAfter The Apprentice had its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, the Trump campaign threatened a lawsuit against the film in a statement released by the campaign's chief spokesperson, Steven Cheung. The statement read:\n\n\"We will be filing a lawsuit to address the blatantly false assertions from these pretend filmmakers. This garbage is pure fiction which sensationalizes lies that have been long debunked. As with the illegal Biden Trials, this is election interference by Hollywood elites, who know that President Trump will retake the White House and beat their candidate of choice because nothing they have done has worked.\"\n\nWritten by Gabriel Sherman, The Apprentice tracks Trump's rise as a real estate businessman in New York in the 70s and 80s. The movie particularly focuses on his relationship with lawyer Roy Cohn and how Trump was guided under his mentorship. Of concern from the Trump campaign are likely certain scenes in the film that depict him in a negative light, including violently raping his first wife Ivana (Maria Bakalova) and undergoing cosmetic surgery. After the film's premiere at Cannes, the director addressed the statement that threatened legal action, and he made an offer to meet Trump in person to screen the film with him.\n\n\"I don't necessarily think that this is a movie he would dislike.

At the center of this chess game is JD Vance, the Ohio senator who emerged from the shadows of political obscurity to become a rising star in conservative circles. His potential role as Donald Trump's running mate, coupled with his involvement in Project 2025, is a crucial piece of a long game designed to upend American democracy as we know it.\n\nBefore JD Vance became a potential running mate for Donald Trump, he was one of Trump's most vocal critics. During the 2016 election, Vance openly condemned Trump, describing him as \"noxious\" and warning that his divisive rhetoric was dangerous for the country. As the Yale-educated author of Hillbilly Elegy, Vance positioned himself as an opponent of Trump's populism, believing his presidency would have disastrous consequences. On the eighth anniversary of a 2016 tweet where he reflected on his disapproval of Trump, he wrote, \"Trump makes people I care about - immigrants, Muslims, etc. - afraid. Because of this, I found him objectionable. God wants better for us.\"\n\nHowever, as Trump's influence within the Republican Party grew stronger, Vance underwent a significant political shift. He gradually aligned himself with Trumpism, embracing the policies he once criticized. This transformation was not just opportunistic but part of Vance's more enormous ambition to rise within the GOP, ultimately positioning him as a potential running mate for Trump.\n\nThe Long Game: JD Vance as Trump's Running Mate\n\nJD Vance's ascendancy in the Republican Party seems to have been deliberately engineered. Once a critic of Trump, Vance transformed himself into a fervent supporter of the former president's policies and persona. His alignment with Trumpism was not merely opportunistic but strategic, positioning himself as a bridge between Trump's base and the far-right intellectual movement.\n\nThe notion of Vance as Trump's running mate plays into a larger conservative plan that doesn't necessarily rely on Trump serving a full term. If Trump wins in 2024, his presidency could be brief, with his apparent cognitive decline and poor health, the 25th Amendment looming as a potential exit strategy. The 25th Amendment allows for the removal of a president who is \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office,\" a tool that could be used by Republicans, especially if Trump's legal troubles, health, or mental fitness become problematic.\n\nThis is where Vance comes in. Vance represents a younger, ideologically extreme version of Trump, with a far deeper commitment to dismantling the structures of American democracy than Trump himself. The plan? Remove Trump under the guise of the 25th Amendment and elevate Vance, who would have the full backing of the conservative movement's infrastructure. This would be a bait-and-switch of epic proportions, placing an even more dangerous figure in the Oval Office.\n\nProject 2025: The Blueprint for the Far-Right Takeover\n\nAt the heart of this conservative takeover is Project 2025, a plan spearheaded by groups like the Heritage Foundation and other influential far-right think tanks. Project 2025 outlines a roadmap for radically reshaping the federal government, including dismantling regulatory agencies, gutting civil service protections, and reshaping the judiciary to entrench conservative power further.\n\nVance's involvement in Project 2025 underscores his deeply embedded in this agenda. Project 2025 doesn't just aim to reverse Biden-era policies; it seeks to return to a pre-1960s America, undoing civil rights legislation, environmental protections, and women's rights. This project envisions a country where executive power is vastly expanded, oversight is reduced, and dissent is quashed. Vance, who has openly criticized government bureaucracy and supports extreme conservative policies, is the perfect candidate to carry out such a vision.\n\nIf Trump were elected and later removed, Vance could seamlessly continue the Project 2025 agenda with little opposition. His polished, intellectual demeanor makes him more palatable to mainstream conservatives than Trump ever was, but his policies would be far more devastating. Unlike Trump, who often governs based on impulse, Vance would govern with precision, systematically dismantling the very foundations of American democracy.\n\nThe 25th Amendment as a Political Tool\n\nThe 25th Amendment was never meant to be used as a political weapon, but the far-right could quickly weaponize it to achieve its goals. Trump, despite his immense popularity among the Republican base, is an unpredictable figure. His bombastic style and erratic behavior make him vulnerable to removal, mainly if his legal challenges catch up with him. The right could invoke the 25th Amendment under the guise of Trump's inability to perform his duties while planning to replace him with a figure more aligned with their long-term goals.\n\nThis is where Vance's appeal becomes even more critical. He offers the conservative right a way to achieve their ideological goals without the chaos that surrounds Trump. Vance, a calculated and disciplined politician, can execute Project 2025 without the distraction of scandal or incompetence. By removing Trump, the far-right could place a more practical but equally extreme leader in power, cloaking their authoritarian agenda in legitimacy.\n\nThe Threat to American Democracy\n\nJD Vance's potential rise to the presidency is not just a concern for liberals or moderates; it's a fundamental threat to the democracy that has defined the United States for centuries. Vance's alignment with Project 2025 shows that he is not interested in preserving the institutions of the American government but in remaking them to reflect a far-right, authoritarian vision. His policies would devastate the checks and balances system, erode civil liberties, and strip away the progress made on issues like racial justice, gender equality, and environmental protection.\n\nIf Trump is elected and then removed under the 25th Amendment, a Vance presidency would be poised to accelerate the most radical aspects of Project 2025. Regulatory agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency could be gutted, effectively ending federal oversight on climate change and environmental justice issues. Civil rights protections, particularly for marginalized communities, could be rolled back under the guise of \"states' rights\" and \"individual freedom.\" The judiciary could be stacked with far-right judges, further entrenching conservative power for decades to come.\n\nConclusion: A Bait-and-Switch of Epic Proportions Hypothetical\n\nThe 2024 election may seem like a repeat of past political cycles, but there's much more at stake. JD Vance as Donald Trump's running mate is not a coincidence; it's a strategic move by the conservative right to ensure that their radical agenda is carried out, even if Trump is removed from office. By using the 25th Amendment to elevate Vance, the far-right would not only continue their war on American democracy but would accelerate it in ways that even Trump has been unable to.\n\nThe threat posed by this plan cannot be overstated. Under Vance's leadership, Project 2025 would systematically dismantle the pillars of American democracy, pushing the country toward an authoritarian regime disguised as populism. This is not just about electing a president; it's about changing the very fabric of the United States.\n\nIf voters aren't paying attention, they could be in for the bait-and-switch of a lifetime - one that could devastate the democracy we know and cherish.","image":"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*MUjBOnSDxC6IMUBAsFt8jA@2x.jpeg","eventUri":"eng-9986439","sentiment":-0.2314,"wgt":466619498,"relevance":1,"source_uri":"malikshakur1.medium.com","source_dataType":"news","source_title":"Medium","author_uri":"malik_shakur@malikshakur1.medium.com","author_name":"Malik Shakur","author_type":"author","author_isAgency":false},{"uri":"8363276177","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2024-10-14","time":"16:26:32","dateTime":"2024-10-14T16:26:32Z","dateTimePub":"2024-10-14T16:26:18Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.5255,"url":"https://www.salon.com/2024/10/14/hatchet-job-the-apprentice-biopic-in-truth-social-rant/","title":"\"Hatchet job\": Trump attacks \"The Apprentice\" biopic in Truth Social rant","body":"Republican presidential candidate, former U.S. President Donald Trump speaks with supporters after a news conference at Trump National Bedminster Clubhouse on August 15, 2024 in Bedminster, New Jersey.

The screenwriter, Gabriel Sherman, described numerous roadblocks in its production.\n\nActors were reluctant to \"humanize\" Trump, Sherman said in Vanity Fair, and Hollywood institutions did not want to fund the project. And, the most significant investor into this project allegedly threatened to kill the film after viewing it.\n\nThis investor was Dan Snyder, a billionaire who formerly owned the NFL's Washington Commanders and a major Trump supporter. Snyder reportedly invested in The Apprentice through his son-in-law Mark Rapaport's film production company, Variety said.\n\n\"He was under the impression that it was a flattering portrayal of the 45th president,\" the outlet reported.\n\nThe Apprentice is anything but. It contains a scene in which Trump's character appears to sexually assault his first wife, Ivana, takes amphetamines, undergoes liposuction, and receives a hair transplant.\n\nIvana claimed that Trump raped her during a divorce deposition, but later recanted this allegation. Trump has denied attacking Ivana. Trump, who has been found liable of sexually abusing the writer E Jean Carroll in civil court, has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 20 women.\n\nTrump's lawyers sent The Apprentice's film-makers cease-and-desist letters, and prominent distributors would not go near it. \"Hollywood fashions itself as a community of truth tellers,\" Sherman said, \"but here they were running from a movie to prepare for a Trump presidency.\"\n\nIn his social media attack posted just before 1am, Trump focused on the film's depiction of Ivana, who died in July 2022 after an accidental fall.\n\n\"My former wife, Ivana, was a kind and wonderful person, and I had a great relationship with her until the day she died,\" Trump wrote. \"The writer of this pile of garbage, Gabe Sherman, a lowlife and talentless hack, who has long been widely discredited, knew that, but chose to ignore it.\n\n\"So sad that HUMAN SCUM, like the people involved in this hopefully unsuccessful enterprise, are allowed to say and do whatever they want in order to hurt a Political Movement, which is far bigger than any of us.

The group is hoping to tilt the power on the court using our normally benign retention elections -- a section of the ballot that you've likely not paid much attention to before.\n\nRetention ballot measures ask voters a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" question about whether appointed judges should continue to serve after their official appointment period ends (and at the Supreme Court level, they traditionally do).\n\nMore: Ads target Oklahoma Supreme Court justices over 'padding the pockets of trial lawyers'\n\nOklahoma voters have never not retained a justice. Yes, that was a double negative for emphasis. In other words, Oklahoma voters have always said an appointed judge placed on the ballot should keep serving.\n\nIn hindsight, I'm surprised it took so long for someone to try to use our election system to manipulate voters into altering the Oklahoma Supreme Court's makeup through retention elections.\n\nAfter all, our justices have been busy for years now striking fear into the hearts of lawmakers and special interests groups by axing loads of patently unconstitutional laws that have the grubby fingerprints of lobbyists and activists all over them.\n\nOur justices have struck down: abortion bans, a law that restricted when schools could require masks, a cap on pain and suffering damages, a liquor law that sought to control alcohol sales, tort reform, special fees on electric and hybrid vehicles, a Ten Commandments monument at the state Capitol and the existence of the nation's first publicly funded religious charter school.\n\nI'm going to stop there with the caveat that that's just a fraction of what they've done.\n\nMore: Does my vote matter? Where your vote in Oklahoma can make a difference\n\nJust looking at the list of all the unconstitutional -- and sometimes downright bonkers -- legislation that our Court has rejected makes me a little queasy.\n\nSo let's pause for a respectful moment of silence as the mournful sounds of taps begin to sound in the distance.\n\nAfter all, what could go wrong if we metaphorically dropped a lit match into a gas-filled room and handed our monied special interests groups the keys to the last independent vestige that remains standing in our kingdom?\n\nKablam!\n\nBecause if these conservative activists have their way and manage to convince voters to do the unthinkable and fire three justices in one swoop, we'll be obliterating the system of checks and balances that we've come to rely on and heralding a new era where we have a judiciary beholden to those that have the money to keep them in office and power.\n\nThere's a reason why there are three branches of government. They keep each other in check.\n\nI'm not sorry that some people are butthurt over our high court's decisions, but I am fearful that they think Oklahoma voters are dumb enough to begin the process of further politicizing our judiciary.\n\nWhy?\n\nI find it very suspicious that the three justices being targeted by the group People for Opportunity were all appointed by former Democratic governors and are being highlighted as \"liberal.\"\n\nAnd I'm concerned that opponents of the judges are running a smear campaign that reeks of age discrimination. The ads point out that these folks are all over the age of 70. Are they suggesting that once someone turns 70, it's time to put them out to pasture, and they're of no more use to society? (Lest we forget the role age has played in another election this year, former President Donald Trump is 78.)\n\nI'm not naive enough to think our Supreme Court is free of political intrigue. These days nothing is. But right now, we're successfully managing to navigate a fine line, and I don't feel like our court resembles the very partisan U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nI'd like to keep it that way.\n\nIn addition, we don't even know who is funding this late-election campaign.\n\nThe source of the group's funding and broader membership is -- legally -- blocked from the public's view. Dare I call it dark money? We know members of the conservative Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs are involved because they're one of the few that's had the guts to put their names and faces on the effort.\n\nBut at this point, pretty much everyone else is skulking creepily in the shadows, egging this on from the slimy sewers.\n\nIf this is so great, put your name and face on it.\n\nI fear the shadowy operatives believe they can convince Gov. Kevin Stitt to put puppets on the bench that are more favorable to their causes, which is bad news for the average Oklahoman.\n\nIt turns out the money and influence special interests wield in the halls of our Capitol doesn't spend as well in our Supreme Court.\n\nBut the campaign backers are banking on the fact that voters know very little about our Supreme Court justices.\n\nAnd, they'd be right.\n\nJudicial ethics prevents judges facing retention votes from campaigning unless there's active opposition to their remaining in the post.\n\nIt's expensive to wage a statewide election campaign. Candidates often have to accept money from those they'll help regulate, which can later raise thorny ethical questions.\n\nOur justices don't campaign, and that's the way it should be.\n\nThe good news is voters have some time to think about the path they want for the Oklahoma Supreme Court.\n\nUnlike our Republican primaries, everyone gets to weigh in on this outcome.","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/09/09/NOKL/75148932007-janelle-stecklein.jpg?auto=webp&crop=1706,960,x0,y85&format=pjpg&width=1200","sentiment":0.2471,"wgt":466618948,"relevance":1,"source_uri":"eu.oklahoman.com","source_dataType":"news","source_title":"Oklahoman","author_uri":"janelle_stecklein@eu.oklahoman.com","author_name":"Janelle Stecklein","author_type":"author","author_isAgency":false},{"uri":"8363271306","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2024-10-14","time":"16:22:23","dateTime":"2024-10-14T16:22:23Z","dateTimePub":"2024-10-14T16:22:10Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.6549,"url":"https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/trump-just-posted-that-the-apprentice-movie-is-defamatory-and-may-not-have-the-right-to-use-that-name-but-will-he-actually-sue/","title":"Trump just posted 'The Apprentice' movie is 'defamatory,' but will he actually file suit?","body":"Former President Donald Trump early Monday blasted the \"FAKE and CLASSLESS\" movie \"The Apprentice\" and called it \"defamatory,\" this after prior threats to sue were disregarded by the filmmaker as bluster.\n\n\"The Apprentice\" biopic, which premiered in New York just days ago, stars Sebastian Stan as Trump and Jeremy Strong, of \"Succession\" fame, as Roy Cohn, the fixer Trump praised even in recent years as a great lawyer who \"did not take notes.\"\n\nAfter midnight Monday on Truth Social, Trump first blasted the film as \"FAKE,\" questioned whether the filmmakers even had the \"right\" to name it \"The Apprentice\" -- given the NBC reality TV show he starred in of the same name -- and called the production \"defamatory\" considering that \"widely discredited\" Vanity Fair special correspondent Gabe Sherman wrote it.\n\nA FAKE and CLASSLESS Movie written about me, called, The Apprentice (Do they even have the right to use that name without approval?), will hopefully \"bomb.\" It's a cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country, \"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" My former wife, Ivana, was a kind and wonderful person, and I had a great relationship with her until the day she died.

It depicts his ascension beyond the shadow of his father, Fred Trump, and his relationship with lawyer Roy Cohn.\n\nAfter premiering at the 2024 Cannes International Film Festival, The Apprentice found distribution. Briarcliff Entertainment acquired the rights to distribute the movie, releasing it on October 11, 2024.\n\nSebastian Stan, known for playing Bucky Barnes/the Winter Soldier in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), starred as Trump in the movie. Jeremy Strong and Maria Bakalova portrayed Roy Cohn and Ivana Trump, respectively.\n\nAli Abbasi directed The Apprentice and is best known for directing Shelley and Holy Spider. The writer, Gabriel Sherman, who Trump called a \"lowlife and talentless hack,\" previously wrote a biography about Fox News Channel's president, Roger Ailes.\n\nDespite generally positive reviews -- it holds a 78% from critics on Rotten Tomatoes -- The Apprentice has not been a box office hit. During its opening weekend, it grossed under $1.6 million domestically.\n\nThat was less than other new releases like Terrifier 3 ($18.3 million), Piece by Piece ($3.8 million), and My Hero Academia: You're Next ($3 million).\n\nIt did make more than two other new releases, Average Joe ($1.1 million) and We Live in Time ($225,911).

Here are the key details about Georgia's Election Integrity Act 2021, or Law S.B. 202.\n\nThe law, which faced much scrutiny during its revision, has five central elements: New restrictions on the use of drop boxes and mobile voting, changes in absentee and provisional ballots, and an expansion on where people can serve as poll workers.\n\nRELATED: 11Alive 2024 election county-by-county voter guide | Fulton, Gwinnett, DeKalb, Cobb and Clayton\n\nVoters now need to provide their driver's license number or specified voter ID, request their ballot at least 11 days before the election, and use an updated absentee ballot form.\n\nThe rules for absentee ballots were less stringent before SB 202, with no requirement for a driver's license number or specific voter ID. Additionally, the timeline for requesting absentee ballots was more flexible, giving voters until the Friday before Election Day.\n\nCounties are now limited to one drop box per 100,000 registered voters. Drop boxes must be located at the office of the board of registrars, absentee ballot clerk, or inside advance voting locations, adding that they can only be opened while the voting is being conducted.\n\nPreviously, there was no restriction on the number of drop boxes, their service times, or their location.\n\nThe law makes it a misdemeanor to give away food or water within 150 feet of the outer edge of a polling place building or within 25 feet of any voter in line. Voters can bring their own food and refreshments with them to stand in line. Poll workers can make available \"self-service water from an unattended receptacle to an elector waiting in line to vote.\"\n\nThis only applied to campaign materials, petition signatures, and setting up tables within 150 feet of the outer edge of a polling place building or within 25 feet of any voter in line.\n\nProvisional ballots cast in the wrong precinct will only count if cast after 5 p.m. Voters who arrive at the wrong precinct before 5 p.m. will be directed to their correct precinct.\n\nVoters who went to the wrong precinct on Election Day could cast a provisional ballot and cast a ballot for any race at that precinct if they were eligible.\n\nMobile voting units can only be used during declared disasters under SB 202.\n\nMobile units were introduced and used to expand early voting opportunities.\n\nChanges allow poll workers to serve in adjoining counties, expanding the pool of eligible workers.\n\nPoll workers were required to be residents or employees of the county they wished to serve.\n\nOther changes included in House Bill 1118 to protect poll workers were re-introduced in February following the experience of former Fulton County election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss. The mother-daughter duo endured death threats from across the nation after former President Donald Trump and his attorney Rudy Giuliani accused them of election fraud, a claim that was quickly debunked.\n\nIf it becomes law, the bill would expand current protections to all election workers, such as contract workers, part-time workers, seasonal workers, and credentialed observers. It would also protect an election worker's personal information from Freedom of Information requests.\n\nRep. Saira Draper, Georgia House Representative for District 90, sponsors the bill. She said she is also adding language to the bill requiring the State Election Board to compile a report about how many threats are reported to the Attorney General's hotline.\n\nRELATED: New changes could come to Georgia poll worker protection bill","image":"https://media.11alive.com/assets/WXIA/images/c6578464-ed87-46f6-8f99-9256c75f2046/c6578464-ed87-46f6-8f99-9256c75f2046_1140x641.jpg","eventUri":"eng-9987182","sentiment":-0.1373,"wgt":466617884,"relevance":1,"source_uri":"11alive.com","source_dataType":"news","source_title":"WXIA-TV 11"},{"uri":"8363246884","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2024-10-14","time":"16:03:57","dateTime":"2024-10-14T16:03:57Z","dateTimePub":"2024-10-14T16:03:42Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.firstpost.com/world/united-states/presidents-of-the-united-states-franklin-pierce-the-man-who-opened-the-door-to-civil-war-13825286.html","title":"Presidents of the United States: Franklin Pierce, the man who opened the door to Civil War","body":"Editor's Note: This is part of a series of profiles taking a closer look at US presidents ahead of the 2024 presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.\n\nThough Franklin Pierce came to the White House during a time of apparent peace, the undercurrents of conflict between the north and south over slavery were already growing stronger.\n\nThe US had attempted to deal with the subject through the Missouri Compromise of 1820, but tensions between the two halves of the country remained ready to combust.\n\nPierce, from New England and at the time the youngest man to hold the office, proclaimed an era of peace and prosperity were at hand when he was sworn in.\n\nEvents were to prove him wrong.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the 14th president of the United States.\n\nEarly years\n\nPierce was born on November 23, 1804, in New Hampshire's Hillsboro. His parents were Benjamin and Anna Pierce. His father was a governor.\n\nPierce went to Bowdoin College in Maine and studied law in Massachusetts. He was admitted to the bar and then married Jane Means Appleton in 1834.\n\nPolitics\n\nPierce entered politics in 1829 as a Democrat. He served in the New Hampshire legislature before becoming Speaker of the House. He was then elected to the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\nThough Pierce was popular in Congress because of his good looks and fine oratory, he accomplished little of note. He then left politics for personal reasons and returned to New Hampshire where he resumed his practice.\n\nPierce next served as an officer in the Mexican-American War and rose to the rank of brigadier, but otherwise kept out of the public eye.\n\nThen, in 1852, the Democrats were at a deadlock at their political convention. After 35 rounds of ballots, Pierce's name was proposed as the candidate. Pierce, ever a moderate, was little known. Better still, he was amenable to all parties.\n\nBy round 48, the nomination was his. His wife Jane, however, was not pleased at all. Jane by all accounts disdained politics. So much so that Pierce had to reassure her that he was not seeking the nomination. Upon learning that her husband had obtained the nomination, Jane fainted.\n\nPierce easily defeated Whig Party nominee Winfield Scott - who incidentally had commanded Pierce during the war.\n\nTragedy struck the Pierces before he even took office. Months before the swearing-in, they lost their only surviving child - eleven-year-old Benny - in a train accident. Worse, both parents witnessed the tragedy. It was a blow from which neither of them, particularly Jane, would fully recover.\n\nPierce was sworn in sans an inaugural ball and the First Lady missing from his side.\n\nTime in office\n\nThe issue of slavery hung over the entire nation - and the Pierce administration. Pierce attempted to stack his cabinet with people from both sides of the divide, but that did not help matters.\n\nThe appointment of Jefferson David - who would go on to become the president of the Confederacy - as Secretary of War drew howls of derision from those who were anti-slavery Pierce as president pushed for and signed the Kansas-Nebraska Act - which repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820 that had sought to keep slavery limited to the southern states.\n\nThis was one of the most important pieces of legislation, and consequential moments, in US history. The Act would set the stage for the rise of the Republican Party and Abraham Lincoln and set America inexorably on the path towards the Civil War. The resulting battle known as 'Bleeding Kansas' between pro and anti-slavery supporters would be a bloody prologue of what was to come.\n\nBy now a divisive figure, Pierce became the first sitting president seeking a second term who was denied by the party. The Democrats instead chose James Buchanan, who would win the presidency. Pierce toured Europe, then returned to New Hampshire and quietly retired from public life.\n\nNow, slavery was Buchanan's problem - and it would soon be up to Lincoln to solve the issue once and for all. Pierce, who had drunk heavily throughout his life, became an alcoholic and passed away in 1869.\n\nLegacy\n\nHistorians do not view Pierce kindly. After all, it was under his auspices that the path to near ruin - Civil War - was laid. However, it is undeniable that events and pieces of legislation that would go down in history, occurred under his tenure.\n\nPierce should perhaps be viewed as a cautionary tale of what a leader should not be in times of strife.","image":"https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/10/Untitled-design-57-2024-10-8e9ed15524a28c00e3fe214c028681fa.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)","sentiment":0.0588,"wgt":466617837,"relevance":1,"source_uri":"firstpost.com","source_dataType":"news","source_title":"Firstpost"},{"uri":"8363242438","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2024-10-14","time":"16:00:35","dateTime":"2024-10-14T16:00:35Z","dateTimePub":"2024-10-14T16:00:12Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-january-6-election-fraud-interference-case-washington-evidence-1968647","title":"Judge Chutkan has \"total lack of interest\" in Trump election claim -- attorney","body":"The judge in Donald Trump's election-fraud case doesn't care that the allegations may embarrass him in election season, a former prosecutor has said.\n\nJudge Tanya Chutkan has ordered the release of yet more explosive evidence in the case, despite objections from Trump's attorneys that it could be damaging at election time.\n\nThe Republican presidential nominee is accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States; conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding; obstruction and attempting to obstruct an official proceeding; and conspiracy against rights in connection with an alleged pressure campaign on state officials to reverse the 2020 election results.\n\nThe former president has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him and repeatedly said he is the victim of a political witch hunt. He has accused chief prosecutor Jack Smith of attempting to interfere in the 2024 presidential election by prosecuting him. Newsweek sought email comment from Trump's attorney on Monday.\n\nWriting in her legal blog, Civil Discourse, on Sunday, former federal prosecutor and frequent critic of Trump, Joyce Vance, noted that Chutkan has repeatedly told the Republican's lawyers that his embarrassment is irrelevant to the case. \"Judge Chutkan continues to show a total lack of interest in Trump's argument that nothing can become public because of the election,\" Vance wrote.\n\nShe noted that, in an order on October 10, Chutkan wrote, \"Defendant's concern with the political consequences of these proceedings is not a cognizable legal prejudice\" that would merit sealing the evidence further. Chutkan granted prosecutors' motion that an appendix of evidence in the case should be released. However, she has given Trump until October 17 to decide how to examine any legal options that might prevent the release.\n\nTrump's lawyers had requested \"that the Court stay that determination for a reasonable period of time so that [he] can evaluate litigation options relating to the decision.\"\n\nOn October 2, Chutkan unsealed a 165-page evidence brief in the case, against the wishes of Trump and his lawyers, who argued that it could damage the Republican nominee during the presidential election cycle.\n\nThe brief contained new information about Trump's alleged activities during the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol in 2021.\n\nThe brief detailed his alleged indifference to the fate of Vice President Mike Pence as pro-Trump rioters hunted for him in the Capitol.\n\nIt added that Trump's team had tried to garner support for a flawed report into alleged voter machine fraud in Michigan. The then-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee refused to publish the report and told Trump it was \"f***ing nuts.\"\n\nThe latest proposed release concerns a substantial appendix to the 165-page evidence brief. That appendix has never been seen by the public and contains further allegations against the former president.\n\nTrump's lawyers had requested that \"no further disclosures\" of \"so-called evidence\" be released because it had been \"unlawfully cherry-picked and mischaracterized\" by the prosecutor's office.","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2482772/jack-smith-evidence-update-donald-trump.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=576116c35afd426b679f2998fa681c6f","sentiment":-0.3961,"wgt":466617635,"relevance":1,"source_uri":"newsweek.com","source_dataType":"news","source_title":"Newsweek","author_uri":"sean_o_driscoll@newsweek.com","author_name":"Sean O'Driscoll","author_type":"author","author_isAgency":false},{"uri":"2024-10-514659145","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2024-10-14","time":"15:59:46","dateTime":"2024-10-14T15:59:46Z","dateTimePub":"2024-10-14T15:23:31Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.8431,"url":"https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/world-news/us-elections-2024-surprising-twist-third-party-candidates-might-change-the-game-kamala-harris-party-worried/articleshow/114222979.cms","title":"US Elections 2024 surprising twist: Third-party candidates might change the game? Kamala Harris' party worried","body":"With the 2024 US Presidential Election nearing, third-party candidates Jill Stein and Chase Oliver could influence key battleground states. Democrats worry Stein could benefit Trump's reelection, prompting targeted ads. Both Stein and Oliver emphasize alternative policies, impacting the close race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Voter outreach becomes crucial in swaying undecided voters.\n\nWith just a month left for the high-stakes US Presidential election 2024, third-party and independent presidential candidates are adding an unpredictable element with every battleground state has at least one such candidate on the ballot. As the time for the 2024 US Presidential election draws closer, independent candidates continue to pose fresh challenges for presidential hopefuls Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.\n\nJill Stein of the Green Party and Chase Oliver of the Libertarian Party are polling at about 1% nationally, according to New York Times polling. Same with Chase Oliver, the Libertarian Party candidate. Although these candidates will not win, they could impact the major party candidates' chances in close states through the \"spoiler\" effect.\n\nBernard Tamas, political science professor at Valdosta State University, said, \"This may wind up being very, very close in these key swing states.\"\n\nALSO READ: Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett silent on backing Kamala Harris as US presidential candidate. Has Trump earned their support?\n\nDemocrats are particularly concerned. Rahna Epting, executive director of MoveOn, said, \"The presidential race could very well come down to a few thousand votes in a handful of states. These third-party candidates -- they still remain a big threat this cycle.\"\n\nDemocrats worry mostly about Stein. On Friday, the Democratic National Committee released ads in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, stating that \"A vote for Stein is really a vote for Trump.\" Trump has expressed support for Stein at a rally.\n\nALSO READ: This Jupiter moon to become another Earth?\n\nIn Michigan, Stein and West could pose threats to Harris. West faced challenges in various states, including Georgia, where he was disqualified.\n\nKennedy, who had an unusual campaign, endorsed Trump after dropping out. Despite efforts to remove himself from some ballots, he remains on the ballots in Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\nStein will appear on ballots in 38 states, including key battlegrounds. Media representatives for the Green Party did not respond for comments, but Stein claimed, \"The system is complicated by design.\"\n\nThe Democratic National Committee released its first-ever television ad targeting Jill Stein as a spoiler who only benefits Donald Trump's reelection. The ad follows Stein's growing support among Arab Americans and Muslims in battleground states like Michigan, Arizona and Wisconsin where they have large populations.\n\n\"The Democrats have lost the Muslim American and the Arab American vote,\" Stein told Reuters after a rally attended by about 100 people in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn on Sunday. \"They're going to be losing enough swing states that they will not win and they cannot win.\"\n\nALSO READ: Stunning discovery in Denmark: 50 exceptionally well preserved skeletons unearthed. Do they hint at hidden society?\n\nJill Stein, an activist and doctor, announced her presidential run with the Green Party and previously ran for president in 2012 and 2016. Some Democrats believe her campaign in 2016 contributed to Donald Trump's victory. As a candidate, Stein promotes an \"economic bill of rights,\" including universal healthcare and the right to a job. She also advocates for climate change action, abortion access, and transgender rights.\n\nStein recently participated in a protest in Gaza, where she was arrested. Despite her support, she is not expected to win more than 2% of the vote, which could potentially impact Vice President Kamala Harris's chances.\n\nIn 2016, Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump by fewer votes than Stein received in three key states. Stein has accused Democrats of attempting to keep her off state ballots to maintain their power. Currently, she is on the ballot in at least four states, with her running mate Butch Ware, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\nAt a rally in June, Trump praised Stein. \"I like her very much,\" he said. \"You know why? She takes 100% from them.\"\n\nStein argues that people often vote \"against someone they dislike\" rather than for someone they truly support.\n\nALSO READ: Meet the most beautiful women in the world. Know the science behind their beauty\n\nChase Oliver is the Libertarian Party's candidate for president. The Libertarian Party, the third-largest political party in the US, typically draws voters who favor smaller government and more individual freedom. Oliver, a 40-year-old sales executive from Georgia, previously ran for Congress.\n\nOliver argues that voters no longer want to choose \"the lesser of two evils.\" His campaign platform includes balancing the federal budget, ending military support to Israel and Ukraine, closing US military bases overseas, and abolishing the death penalty.\n\nLibertarian candidates generally secure 1-3% of the vote, mainly drawing support from Republicans. In the 2020 presidential election, the Libertarian candidate's votes in three key battleground states outnumbered the margin by which Donald Trump lost those states. If those votes had gone to Trump, he might have won those states and potentially altered the overall election outcome.\n\nWisconsin has a particularly crowded ballot. In addition to Trump and Harris, voters will be able to choose among Stein and Oliver; Cornel West, a theologian and independent candidate; Robert F.

Epting mentioned they are now focused on direct voter outreach, saying, \"The more we engage the voters, especially hard-to-reach voters on this election, and talk to them about Kamala Harris' agenda for this country, that is an incredibly effective strategy.\"\n\nAdditionally, Democrats have accused Republican operatives of assisting outsider candidates like West. Edwin DeJesus of the West campaign denied these allegations.","image":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-1200,height-900,imgsize-1008191,resizemode-75,msid-114222979/news/international/world-news/us-elections-2024-surprising-twist-third-party-candidates-might-change-the-game-kamala-harris-party-worried.jpg","eventUri":"eng-9986406","sentiment":0.0824,"wgt":466617586,"relevance":12,"source_uri":"m.economictimes.com","source_dataType":"news","source_title":"The Economic Times","author_uri":"donald_trump@m.economictimes.com","author_name":"Donald Trump","author_type":"author","author_isAgency":false},{"uri":"8363241277","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2024-10-14","time":"15:59:32","dateTime":"2024-10-14T15:59:32Z","dateTimePub":"2024-10-14T15:59:13Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.5922,"url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-trump-battle-biggest-battlegrounds-its-clearly-ground-zero","title":"Harris, Trump battle for the biggest of the battlegrounds: 'It's clearly ground zero'","body":"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.\n\nWith a margin-of-error race and just three weeks to go until Election Day, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump on Monday each campaigned in the biggest of the battleground states.\n\nBut the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees will be on the opposite ends of Pennsylvania, with Harris holding events in Erie, in the northwest corner of the state, and Trump in suburban Philadelphia, in the southeastern portion of the commonwealth.\n\nIt's the vice president's 10th visit to Pennsylvania since replacing President Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket in mid-July. Trump's also been a frequent visitor, with rallies in Scranton and Reading less than a week ago.\n\nPOLLS: TRUMP CLOSING GAP WITH HARRIS WITH THREE WEEKS UNTIL ELECTION\n\nPennsylvania, along with Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada, had razor-thin margins that decided Biden's 2020 victory over Trump. And the seven states will likely determine whether Harris or Trump wins the 2024 presidential election.\n\nBut with 19 electoral votes at stake, Pennsylvania's the biggest of the key battlegrounds. And while the campaigns and their allied super PACs are pouring resources into all seven states, more money has been spent to run spots in Pennsylvania than any of the other battlegrounds, according to figures from AdImpact, a top national ad tracking firm.\n\nWHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLS IN THE 2024 ELECTION SHOW\n\nHarris starts her latest stop in the Keystone State with a conversation with Erie area Black men at a locally owned small business, as part of her efforts to court a group of voters traditionally loyal to the Democratic Party.\n\nThe vice president will then headline a rally at the Erie Insurance Arena. Democratic Sen. John Fetterman is also scheduled to speak.\n\n\"At the rally, the Vice President will highlight her vision for a New Way Forward, while encouraging Pennsylvanians to vote early or return their mail ballot,\" the Harris campaign said.\n\nErie is a Democratic-dominated city of roughly 94,000 people that's surrounded by suburban and rural areas with significant numbers of Republican voters.

Rory McIlroy became an early victim of the trend with one pundit comparing his U.S. Open choke job earlier this year to Kamala Harris' failures within the media.\n\nDuring Sunday's edition of 'This Week' on ABC, political analyst Reince Priebus brought up the fact that Republicans are leading Democrats in the ABC/IPSOS poll for the first time in 32 years.\n\nPriebus went on to deliver a strong opinion that Harris' messaging and inability to say anything meaningful in front of a camera, followed by her failed attempt at stopping the bleeding, is turning voters off. This then led him into lobbing a stray in McIlroy's direction.\n\n\"She had a terrible week,\" Priebus said of Harris. \"She picked a pointless fight with Ron DeSantis, she's losing in the Sun Belt, and she tried to recover by going on 'The View' which a lot of women watch.\"\n\n\"She wanted to clarify the two most important issues that are facing these two candidates, the economy and immigration, and she bombed like Rory [McIlroy] at the U.S. Open and she went on there and said that there was nothing she would do that would be different than Joe Biden and she created a campaign commercial for Donald Trump.\"\n\nHarris' appearance on 'The View' should have been the layup of all layups for her campaign, yet it turned into a dumpster fire with her admitting that she wouldn't change a single thing the Biden administration implemented.\n\nMcIlroy's collapse at Pinehurst this summer was one of the most shocking we've seen in recent sports history, yet Harris moving backward in certain polls after appearing on an anti-Trump, anti-Republican talk show could prove to be even worse.","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/10/rory-kamala.jpg","sentiment":-0.2471,"wgt":466617398,"relevance":1,"source_uri":"outkick.com","source_dataType":"news","source_title":"OutKick","author_uri":"mark_harris@outkick.com","author_name":"Mark Harris","author_type":"author","author_isAgency":false},{"uri":"8363231007","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2024-10-14","time":"15:50:54","dateTime":"2024-10-14T15:50:54Z","dateTimePub":"2024-10-14T15:50:43Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.5098,"url":"https://www.wglt.org/politics-and-government/2024-10-14/illinois-officials-battle-misinformation-to-protect-integrity-of-november-election","title":"Illinois officials battle misinformation to protect integrity of November election","body":"At the Sulzer Regional Library on a recent Wednesday night, an informational video and hands-on demonstration tried to ease voters' concerns with a blunt message: \"You can trust the voting machines.\"\n\nBut the less than a dozen attendees, huddled in a semicircle around a voting machine, still had plenty of questions about what would come next on Election Day.\n\nThey wondered: How are election judges vetted? Is there any way an election judge could sabotage somebody's vote? How protected are city servers from being hacked? Are governments like Russia and China accessing voting records?\n\nIt was the first of three voting machine demonstrations the Chicago Board of Elections is hosting in the run-up to the Nov. 5 election, where election security is at the forefront of voters' minds.\n\nRussian influence and false claims of a rigged election plagued the last two presidential elections. This time, Illinois election officials said disinformation poses the biggest threat to the integrity of the vote.\n\nBad actors both domestically and abroad \"[a]re trying to get into the minds of voters, and they're trying to pit voters against each other,\" said Matt Dietrich, spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections.\n\nThrough The Democracy Solutions Project, WBEZ, the Chicago Sun-Times and the University of Chicago's Center for Effective Government at the Harris School of Public Policy are examining the challenges to our democracy and potential solutions in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election.\n\nIllinois, a reliably blue state that has voted for the Democratic nominee in the last eight presidential elections, hasn't seen the same specters of conspiracy theories and allegations of fraud that have taken root in states like Arizona and Georgia.\n\nCase in point: A state-commissioned task force was created in 2022 to issue recommendations to combat foreign interference and cyberattacks in the run-up to the November election. It never even saw members appointed.\n\nFinding available experts who weren't already involved in similar efforts \"proved to be difficult,\" said John Patterson, spokesman for Illinois Senate President Don Harmon, and lawmakers didn't want to get in the way of the State Board of Elections' own security efforts.\n\n\"So the decision was made to shift gears and work directly with state elections officials and the Illinois Attorney General's office to identify issues and concerns as they pop up and address them through the legislative process,\" Patterson said in a statement, pointing to a recent state law that addressed publication of voters' personal information.\n\nIn parts of the country, election authorities are adding bulletproof glass and panic buttons. Illinois officials say they're taking precautions -- though less extreme ones, from having Narcan on hand in case of fentanyl-laced suspicious packages to adding security officers for election sites and giving election workers more protections, like leaving their names off IDs. The FBI is investigating suspicious packages received by the Illinois State Board of Elections and officials across the country, although Chicago and Cook County said they had not received similar threats.\n\n\"We do have to prepare for the worst,\" Chicago Board of Elections spokesman Max Bever said. \"No matter what.\"\n\nIn addition to election judges and poll watchers, over 400 polling place investigators, who are often off-duty or retired law enforcement, are hired for early voting and Election Day in Chicago, Bever said. The Cook County clerk's office has increased physical security for early voting sites, mail ballot deliveries and pickups and at the operations center and main office, said Edmund Michalowski, the Cook County deputy clerk of elections. Security will be provided through the Cook County Sheriff's Office and a private security firm.\n\n\"We doubled it for this 2024 November for two reasons,\" Michalowski said. \"One, that obviously the election is a really hot topic around the country. But also, it's going to probably be close to 70% turnout, so it's nice to have more people ... that we can make sure that we have enough people on site to take care of the needs of the voters.\"\n\nA new provision in state law went into effect in July that no longer requires election judges to have their name displayed on ID badges, in an attempt to shield workers from personal retribution, Dietrich said.\n\nIllinois voters will also be weighing whether to give election workers more protections through an advisory referendum on the November ballot. It asks whether candidates should be subject to civil penalties for attempting to interfere with an election worker's duties. State Rep. Jay Hoffman, who sponsored the legislation putting the question before voters, said that could encompass anything from threats to acts of violence against workers.\n\n\"It's one thing to allege fraud. It's another thing to threaten an election worker,\" Hoffman said. \"First of all, it's against every democratic principle we have ever, as a country, stood for. But secondly, it's going to have a chilling effect.\"\n\nVoting equipment is also getting more enhancements. Each of the more than 1,400 large metal cabinets which house voting equipment to be sent to each precinct across the suburbs is now equipped with a GPS tracking device, \"so we know exactly where it is,\" Michalowski said.\n\nAfter Russian hackers infiltrated Illinois' voter registration database in 2016, the Illinois State Board of Elections has created a division of information security, partnered with the Illinois National Guard to tap its cybersecurity experts and bolstered resources and training for election authorities throughout the state.\n\nAt the voting demonstration, Bever ticked through the many layers of safeguards that are already in place.\n\nEach election machine undergoes tests. They are never connected to the internet. Officials keep a strict chain of custody, documenting each person who has inspected a machine. Voting equipment and ballots are secured and transported under video surveillance. Chicago has no drive-through drop boxes. Paper ballots are only printed by approved shops to ensure they meet specifications and can be read by scanners.\n\n\"Illinois is still an all-paper-ballot state, so no matter which way you vote, either on a touch screen or by paper ballot, there's always going to be a paper trail,\" Bever said. \"And that's important, because paper ballots can be reviewed for audits and recounts as necessary, and the voter can always review their choices on the ballots.\"\n\nBut Bever called for more funding to safeguard ballots, arguing that it's getting more expensive to keep up with sophisticated threats.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, West Ridge resident Mary Dudek witnessed misinformation around the coronavirus and vaccines unfold in real time at the federally qualified health center where she worked. It was staggering and disappointing, she said. Now she fears it's happening again -- this time with the election.\n\n\"I was shocked by how impacted we all were from that misinformation, and now I'm seeing that same kind of process unfolding again,\" Dudek said. \"So it's very worrisome.\"\n\nA recent poll by the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that a majority surveyed (78%) feel the spread of misinformation about the government is a major problem. Of those surveyed, 39% found it very or somewhat difficult to know if what candidates are saying is true or not.\n\nAt the voting machine demonstration at Sulzer library, Dudek was hoping to learn more strategies to help the average person sift through the noise.\n\n\"It's just one thing after another. And if you are trying to stay on top of things, these are challenging times, because there's so much that is painful going on,\" she said.\n\nNonpartisan voting groups and election authorities are launching new concerted efforts to help voters discern for themselves. The Illinois Attorney General's Office offers tips on how to spot artificially generated images. Public service announcements sponsored by the Illinois State Board of Elections are airing across hundreds of radio and television stations in Illinois; they encourage voters to turn to their election authorities for the most trusted info.\n\n\"We do not want to alienate them or create this 'us against you' environment where they feel like they're being insulted,\" Dietrich said, noting he avoids using terms like \"election denier.\" \"We want to get them back to where they always were before, where inherently, they trusted elections -- that elections in the United States are secure.\"\n\nThe League of Women Voters of Illinois has marshaled its members to debunk common myths and teach media literacy through its new Mis/Disinformation Task Force. Its website features a toolkit and talks from experts on everything from protecting democracy in the age of social media and artificial intelligence to talking with people who disagree with you.\n\n\"If you argue with people, that doesn't work. What works is listening to them, asking questions, asking them to start questioning on their own,\" said Anne Sullivan, co-chair of the Mis/Disinformation Task Force.\n\nBarb Laimins, co-chair of the task force, has a new motto that is an old adage of journalists: If your mother says she loves you, check it out. If people have questions about election security, Laimins said there's no better way to get answers than signing up to work as an election judge.\n\n\"When you become an election judge, you become the perfect purveyor of accurate information and support of our election systems,\" Laimins said.","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8a8e4cf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5799x3262+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F03%2Fa1%2F7533d3a049f2b380cae823bc96c8%2Fpolls.jpg","eventUri":"eng-9987162","sentiment":-0.0118,"wgt":466617054,"relevance":1,"source_uri":"wglt.org","source_dataType":"news","source_title":"wglt.org"},{"uri":"8363228691","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2024-10-14","time":"15:49:51","dateTime":"2024-10-14T15:49:51Z","dateTimePub":"2024-10-14T15:48:59Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.6235,"url":"https://www.fox5ny.com/election/2024-election-update-latest-polls-news-presidential-candidate-stops-today-oct-14","title":"2024 election update: Latest polls, news, presidential candidate stops today | Oct. 14","body":"NEW YORK - With 22 days until the 2024 election, Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump are in Pennsylvania, hoping to win over the country's biggest swing state as polls are showing a neck-and-neck race between the Republican and Democratic candidates.\n\nJUMP TO: Election Day Countdown | Election News Today | Tracking Trump and Harris | Latest Polls | Election Map\n\nAs America prepares to pick a new president - and Tri-State residents choose how to fill out their own ballots - we dive into the latest national and local election news, polls, campaign trail stops, maps and more.\n\nElection Day is Tuesday, Nov. 5, 22 days from today.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are taking their fight for Pennsylvania's Electoral College votes to opposite ends of the state.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris: The Democratic nominee is holding a rally in Erie, a Democratic-majority city of about 94,000 people bordered by suburbs and rural areas with significant numbers of Republicans.

Ivana died in 2022.\n\nScreenwriter Gabriel Sherman told Entertainment Weekly that the \"most shocking\" moments in the film are all based on \"real events.\" \"The funny thing is, everything in the movie that seems the most shocking is actually completely based on real events,\" he said. \"Very little has been dramatized.

Shop now and get 10% off with code RB10. Vet & LEO-founded.\n\nTrump emphasized that the decision was unanimous, describing it as \"thousands of people\" coming together in support.\n\nPaul Perez, the president of the National Border Patrol Council, joined Trump on stage to address the crowd.\n\nPerez delivered a strong message, warning of the consequences if Kamala Harris wins the 2024 election. \"If we allow border czar Harris to win this election, every city, every community in this great country is going to go to hell,\" Perez said, citing the influx of unvetted individuals who have entered the country, leading to increased crime rates including \"murders, rapes, robberies, and burglaries.\"\n\nPerez voiced his support for Trump as the only candidate capable of resolving the border crisis. \"Only one man can fix that. That is Donald J. Trump,\" he told the crowd, adding that Trump has consistently stood by the men and women protecting the border and risking their lives for the country.\n\nPerez also emphasized the stark choice voters face in November: either allow the chaos to continue at the southern border with criminal cartels controlling drug and human trafficking, or vote to restore order.\n\nHe highlighted the threat posed by the smuggling of drugs, particularly fentanyl, which has devastated communities across the nation.\n\n\"On behalf of the 16,000 men and women represented by the National Border Patrol Council, we strongly support and endorse Donald J. Trump for President of the United States,\" Perez declared, signaling the union's firm backing for Trump.\n\nFollowing the endorsement, Trump expressed his appreciation for the council, calling them an \"incredible group of people\" and reiterating his commitment to supporting the agents who protect the U.S. border.\n\nAs Trump continues to campaign for votes in key battleground states, he took the opportunity at the rally to criticize Kamala Harris and vowed never to allow the U.S. military to become \"woke.\" During the event, Trump also showed a clip from the film Full Metal Jacket on a screen behind him, featuring R. Lee Ermey's drill sergeant character, before humorously transitioning into a mock \"pride month\" announcement.\n\nIn addition to addressing border security, Trump promised to prioritize reducing violent crime and supporting law enforcement if elected.\n\nThe rally in Arizona, a critical swing state, is part of Trump's broader effort to galvanize voters ahead of the November 2024 election.\n\nAccording to a recent poll conducted by the Wall Street Journal, the race between Trump and Harris remains extremely close in several key battleground states.\n\nThe survey, conducted between September 28 and October 8, found that Trump and Harris are tied in North Carolina and Wisconsin, while Harris holds slight leads in Arizona and Georgia.\n\nTrump's biggest advantage is in Nevada, where he leads Harris 49% to 43%. Pennsylvania also remains close, with Trump leading 47% to 46%.\n\nVoters in the poll indicated they trust Trump more when it comes to handling the economy, inflation, and border security.\n\nAs the election nears, both candidates are expected to intensify their efforts to win over voters in these key states.\n\nThe opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of LifeZette.

I remember during my first, in 2020, I was freshly 18 and brimming with an almost egoistic confidence in my decision to abstain from voting. I did not have faith in either the Democratic Party or their nominee, Joe Biden, to represent me.\n\nFour years later, my view of the Democratic Party has only worsened, especially as Palestinian blood continues to spill by their hands. And yet, at the same time, the threat of fascism from the Republican Party is becoming ever more real. The far-right has intensified its attacks on the bodily autonomy of women, the LGTBQ community, and on the rotting carcass that is American Democracy. Now that I am 22, and in stark contrast to my past self, this election leaves me writhing in a pool of self-doubt. The same question repeats over and over in my head: Can I really sit this one out?\n\nIt is within this tension that I found myself sitting down with three next-system thinkers about the upcoming election. These activists and scholars have dedicated their lives to challenging systemic poverty and economic injustice through decades of combined experience in grassroots organizing in the United States. Our discussion touched not only on the significance of the 2024 election but the increasingly acute political crisis in the United States and the current prospects for system change.\n\nWe're living globally in a period of a profound economic crisis and environmental catastrophe.\n\nWhat I learned, in some ways, reflected my own ambivalence. They too were divided on the question that Bill Fletcher described in our interview as \"the politics of moral outrage versus the politics of power.\" As Cheri Honkala shared with me, it is important that Americans vote their conscience in the face of a genocide carried out in Palestine by the Democratic Party. However, Stephanie Luce offered an opposing perspective, urging the left to \"get realistic about our power\" in the context of an increasingly emboldened, fascistic right wing. Ultimately, what these contrasting tendencies represent is an ongoing historical debate between two different philosophies for the American left.\n\nThese interviews have been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nQ: There seems to be a general sense that, regardless of who wins the 2024 presidential election, the system as a whole -- the social, ecological, economic, and political system of which we are all a part -- has some very serious issues. What systemic problems do you see today and how serious are they?\n\nCheri Honkola: Our capitalist system has created a situation where people just can't live... People have absolutely no rights to land, no rights to free speech, and no rights to live anywhere. And there's a serious increasing criminalization just of being poor and just of being homeless in this country. People just can't live right now, so people are being forced to set up co-ops and a cooperative economy and all of those kinds of things. And the approach, I think, for folks that are on the absolute bottom, it's a little different. There's a growing equality of misery; we're very clear that there's going to be no utopia under capitalism.\n\nBill Fletcher Jr.: We're living globally in a period of a profound economic crisis and environmental catastrophe, and this convergence runs us into the equivalent of two tectonic plates that are crashing against one another. And in that situation, you have mountains that are built, and you have earthquakes, and we're seeing both, and so this is creating great instability and anxiety.\n\nIn the United States, in part as a reflection of that, we're living through a cold Civil War. And this cold Civil War really became very evident with Newt Gingrich and the Contract With America, there were clear signs of counterattack against the victories that had been won in the 20th century. Now since then, key elements in the Republican establishment have made use of mass movements on the right that have been developing since the late 60s and have thought that they could manipulate them, but instead, what they've done is follow the course of Dr. Frankenstein in creating a monster that they can't control, and that's why the MAGA movement smacked out of the way the opponents to former U.S. President Donald Trump both in 2016 and this year. So, it's a very dangerous situation, and the danger's compounded by an armed wing of the right-wing authoritarian movement, plus the recklessness of very wealthy men, so it creates a very unstable situation.\n\nIf we go down a path of authoritarian rule, I don't see any hope for addressing a more functioning economy or a more sustainable climate situation that's going to protect the most impacted.\n\nStephanie Luce: Well, I think it's multidimensional. The crises are from a number of angles. Some of the most pressing issues are certainly related to climate. There is really no way of turning back, so our choices are to slow down the worst of it and mitigate the worst impacts. But in any case, it seems, we're already in it, and a lot of people are already experiencing a climate crisis, and then certainly, there are growing threats to democracy around the world, of people even electing authoritarian leaders and losing faith in democracy. And I would say the U.S. certainly has never had a real democracy even to begin with. So, it's not like I'm romanticizing what came before, but it is possible that even that can go backwards, instead of forwards, in terms of creating a real multiracial democracy. And then how we think about the economy, there are a lot of measures that would suggest things are relatively stable right now, but underneath it is certainly not a sustainable system, it's an economy that's producing for profit instead of human need and producing for growth instead of sustainability. So, I would say those are the underlying crises that will be there no matter what the outcome of the election is.\n\nQ: Given what you just shared, what kinds of changes to the system do you see as absolutely necessary? And what changes do you think are opening up that you are really excited about?\n\nCheri: One of the things I see is that this growing equality of misery is a different form of unity that is developing. The ruling class has really figured out how to keep us divided in regard to gender, race, and all of these other kinds of things. And I think that the positive side of the negative is that it's forcing us to figure out how to work together to create something very different in order to stay alive.\n\nOne of the closest people I work with is an African American male who was formerly homeless and incarcerated, served some time in the military, has seven kids, and is married. There's no way we would have been working together for 30 years just because he's a nice guy. We have nothing in common. But we've had to figure out ways to work together. People need each other desperately in order to stay alive.\n\nFor us, it's really about organizing. To literally take back land, organize to take back food, working together to demand the other half of the operation for a kid's mouth, and that's why we've just recently written this book Takeover. It's a little bit of our history, but it's also a manual on teaching homeless people across this country how to house themselves in abandoned government homes that are vacant because there are more abandoned properties than there are homeless people. And I think that the other positive thing is that there's so much surplus right now that it really is a question of redistribution and getting organized to take back our human rights.\n\nWe have to create a block that's capable of winning and introducing substantive, structural changes.\n\nBill: Well, the system itself is a rock, so I start there. Capitalism is antithetical to the future of humanity. Now, on top of that, the U.S. sociopolitical system that's based on or built upon, capitalism is itself rigged against people of color, women, against working-class people. And one of the things about the way it's rigged, particularly when it comes to people of color, is that when we try to play by the rules, the rules get changed. We see this in elections by different things that the Republicans have been doing in terms of voter suppression. You see this in the economy and business. The demand needs to be for consistent democracy, an expansion of democracy into all spheres, not a retraction or a retrenchment, and so we need to make it easier for people to vote, not more difficult. We need to make it easier for workers to form unions, not more difficult. We need to make it easier for women to control their own bodies, not more difficult. We need to make it easier for LGBTQ folks to live their lives in harmony and not more difficult. We need to be addressing the fact that the planet is burning rather than ignoring it. Those are the kinds of things that we need to be doing, and those are the changes that need to be introduced and that we need to demand of our political leaders.\n\nStephanie: Well for me, in a sense, the building of a multiracial democracy is an outcome and a way to address the other two. I don't see how if we go down a path of authoritarian rule, I don't see any hope for addressing a more functioning economy or a more sustainable climate situation that's going to protect the most impacted. So I guess for me, some of my effort has been focusing on deepening and expanding and making democracy real, because I feel like that's one of our only hopes for addressing those other serious crises.\n\nI think it's a strange moment of kind of real highs and lows. So, I have been involved myself in a number of efforts to engage more people in this fight around democracy, acknowledging, again, like I said, the ways in which it has failed many of us up until now. It's not about just saying, let's revive the status quo or what's done been before, but can we deepen it and make it more real, whether it's in the workplace, through having a voice at work and even thinking about worker control, whether it's in our communities, and thinking about what it would look like if we had people who are most impacted making real decisions about things like housing and transportation.\n\nSome of the training and discussion about what democracy could look like, the ways in which it's failed us, and the historic role that working people have played in fighting off authoritarian governments, I think that's interesting. There are people definitely worried about that and engaged in that. My other arena is particularly around worker organizing, just tons of interest. I've never seen this level of interest in the entire time I've worked on this, particularly among young people, about how it's not just about fighting for things, like a union that's important, but like, really questioning, why do we even work at all? What is it for? What's the purpose of work, and who makes the decisions about how the economy runs?\n\nQ: Staying on the theme of new possibilities: What kinds of new combinations do you see as possible -- unusual allies, new ways of coming together, new sets of approaches -- in the 2020s that may have been more difficult to achieve in the past?\n\nCheri: Well, there really is this thing that we call a growing, developing new class. And so that's like a nurse friend of mine that just figured she was going to be a nurse the rest of her life and everything would be great. And now she's an older woman, and she couldn't figure out the technology, and so she was replaced by a bunch of younger people that are going into nursing that were born and raised with computers. Or it's the person that has worked someplace, and they've totally eliminated that industry that used to pay enough so you could have a two-car garage or thought that they were going to be great for the rest of their life because they worked at a union and paid union dues their whole life, and then they close down that shop. These are the new people that are coming to the bottom and that we're working together with, and that's a huge fall. And these are people who really believe that they have an entitlement.\n\nYou know capitalism has really done a job on poor people period, to have them believe that they don't really deserve any of these things, and they don't have rights, and they've been individual failures, and it's not a part of a larger system. And I think that that's harder to buy when you're part of this growing new class of people that are becoming expendable.\n\nBill: We have been witnessing the rise of new and renovated social movements. We have not yet built a conscious majoritarian block that can win power. That's what we need to do. We need to first block or stop MAGA, but stopping MAGA is not enough. We have to create a block that's capable of winning and introducing substantive, structural changes.\n\nI think that the two corporate political parties in this country are going to fight like hell to remain relevant.\n\nSo, I'm not sure that there are any new combinations as such. It's more about making the combinations more conscious and standing up against ethno-nationalism and identity-exclusive politics.\n\nStephanie: On the one hand, there are a lot of young people, and not just only young people, but a lot of energy from young people looking to rebuild an internationalist movement particularly focused on Gaza, but that brings people to renew their interest in learning about other parts of the world, and we do have more tools to communicate across borders and talk to and learn from activists across the globe. So that's a positive place for me. I also think there are a number of issues that are really contentious, but actually kind of divide our political parties or divide our coalitions. I think immigration is one, for example, it tends to be portrayed as if there's a Republican position and a Democratic position. I don't actually think that's true.\n\nI think there's actually a lot of division within the Democratic Party and also division within the Republican Party, because a lot of people who are truly Christian or religious have a belief in rights. Employers, for example, have historically been wanting to embrace immigrants and bring more immigrants to the country. So, there's these issues that divide the coalitions as they stand and could make space for reconfiguration of new alliances, certainly also around things like healthcare, that crosses party lines. And it's more about 1% versus 99% -- and climate as well, I think climate is another area of possibly renewed alliances, and some of that's generational, but it's also about some people's values that that they hold and it's like, Okay, actually, the parties aren't speaking for these values.\n\nQ: It looks like system change is coming whether we like it or not. There are endless possibilities for what the next system might look like, good and bad. What do you see as the organizing and movement building challenges that absolutely must be overcome in order to build a better world?\n\nCheri: I think we're in an in-between stage right now, and those who are already facing fascism are terrified and having to confront that. That's immigrants in this country, and people that are already living behind bars. And neighborhoods like Kensington are already dealing with a system where the government and the police there and the politicians are all working together, and where they have mobile jails, and there is no due process, and there is no media covering our day-to-day reality. Like in Kensington and other areas of the country, they want absolute control, there already has been a genocide of different sections of the population with the fentanyl crisis, and more people have died now from fentanyl than died during the Vietnam War. And that is crippling people and killing people, and nothing is being done about it.\n\nI think that the two corporate political parties in this country are going to fight like hell to remain relevant. They will buy or offer cabinet positions or large amounts of resources for their organizations to divert the population from system change and keep them in some kind of reform. Have the people's leaders take them in the direction of reform. So, what you see happening now in this country is the immense threat of anybody that's talking about the creation of a different kind of system, versus getting on the bandwagon for Kamala Harris. I have so many Democrat bots on my social media. It's like a full-time job for them. I'm old enough to remember back in the day when there was a real anti-war movement in this country, and you would never think of any civil rights organizations not being involved. There are so many people who are in the financial pockets right now of the Democratic Party for their places of faith. While, literally, children are being slaughtered and the genocide is going on in Gaza; it's just devastating.\n\nInternally, I think we need to really up our internal training about long-term strategy and be realistic about our power.\n\nBill: One of the big dangers is purism. We see it in the electoral realm all the time, and it's the idea that if a politician does not have exactly my platform, they are a sellout and not worthy of support. It's also reflective of the politics of moral outrage versus the politics of power. So, the politics of moral outrage are represented by \"we are furious about this, that, or whatever, and therefore we're not going to vote for this candidate, or we're not going to vote at all.\" And that view is objectively apocalyptic. Basically, it means that no change can come about until there's a total collapse. And some people believe that you have this kind of pure streak that is waiting. I often analogize it to a surfer who paddles out into the ocean waiting for the ideal wave, believing that once they get it, they can ride it straight into shore. And that's not politics. That's something else. Sectarianism is related. It's sort of the notion that it's my way or the highway.\n\nMountain Stronghold Mentality is something that Bill Gallegos and I have written about, and it's a notion that comes from an era in the Chinese Revolution when there were guerrilla bands that were literally on mountaintops that would be their base area. They'd come down and attack the enemy and then go back to the base areas. The revolution shifted, and they needed mobile units to engage the enemy in a different way. Many of the guerrilla commanders didn't want to come down from mountaintops, because they were comfortable. They were secure. They didn't believe that they could be captured or destroyed by the enemy, and so they basically, despite the change in conditions, sought comfort. We see this with organizations that are afraid to take risks and to unite with others because they're comfortable where they are.\n\nAnother problem is the lack of strategy and strategic thinking. We progressives are very used to fighting defensive battles when we have difficulty thinking offensively. So, I'll give you an example. I often use this example. A number of years ago, maybe 10 years ago, I was in Texas on a speaking engagement, and it was before [Greg] Abbott was elected governor. And so, I was giving a talk about something, and during the Q and A, people were telling me how bad the situation was in Texas. So, I listened. They wanted to know what I thought needed to be done. And I said, How do we take over Texas? They took a deep breath, sat back, couldn't figure out what I was thinking, whether I had lost my mind, and I said to them, look, you've told me how bad the situation is. I get it. We have two alternatives. One, we can give up, go off, and get high, right? The other is that we develop a strategy to win. And the strategy to win needs to look at everything, from which are the key cities in Texas, which are the key counties, which are the counties that we can afford to ignore? What are the social movements that are in operation? Who are the key opinion makers? Where can resources be obtained? All of these things. And then read a little bit of Sun Tzu, you know The Art of War, and think strategically about how we win.\n\nStephanie: Oh, there's so many. Yeah. I mean, this is a long list, but for me, I sometimes think about it as, what do we need to do internally, within our organizations and movements? I think we need to think about that. And then there's the set of external challenges. And so internally, I think we need to really up our internal training about long-term strategy and be realistic about our power. A lot of us don't have power, and instead, we tend to look for a moral stance like, what's the right thing to do? That's important, but if it doesn't come with building power, then it's not a strategy. I worked on this book called Practical Radicals because people have tended to be either radicals with big dreams and visions but with no plan to win, or very pragmatic and with a small, winnable goal, but it's too small to really change much. So, I think as organizations and movements, we have to really get better trained on how to do long-term strategy, and that includes also getting better about how to work in alliance with one another across our organizations and sectors where we don't agree on everything. People in the climate movement might not share the same goals and visions as some people in labor unions, for example, but we have to find those common-ground ways in which we're all better off. We're stronger together than we are apart.\n\nAnd then I think the external challenges are massive. Because the U.S. state is well armed and powerful. The police state is massive. People will be deported, shot at, arrested. So, we have to be realistic about the powers that we are up against, not just in the United States, but globally. And really also get strategic about how to divide that ruling coalition. They don't all benefit from it, or they benefit unequally, and that means that we need to think about peeling off certain segments of that. That means working with people we really don't like and whom we disagree with on a lot of things, but we might share common end goals, such as climate sustainability or defending democracy as a system. So those external threats are real, and we just don't have the power on our own to really make those kinds of changes.","image":"https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/video-footage-of-the-trump-harris-debate.webp?id=53616283&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C95%2C0%2C95","sentiment":-0.0667,"wgt":466615319,"relevance":1,"source_uri":"commondreams.org","source_dataType":"news","source_title":"Common Dreams"},{"uri":"2024-10-514620374","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2024-10-14","time":"15:17:33","dateTime":"2024-10-14T15:17:33Z","dateTimePub":"2024-10-14T15:16:54Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.7961,"url":"https://www.modernghana.com/news/1348617/election-2024-were-wholeheartedly-supporting.html","title":"Election 2024: We're wholeheartedly supporting you for our development  --  Banda Traditional Council tells Bawumia","body":"The Banda Traditional Council has pledged its full support for Vice President and New Patriotic Party (NPP) flagbearer, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, in the upcoming 2024 presidential election, as well as the party's parliamentary candidate for Banda, Joe Dankwa.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the council during Dr. Bawumia's campaign visit to Banda on Sunday, the Omanhene, Nana Sekyemme Sinapem II, highlighted the development projects the NPP has brought to their community.\n\nHe noted that major projects in the Banda constituency, from President Kufuor's administration to Nana Addo's, were all initiated under NPP governments and expressed gratitude for their commitment to the area.\n\n\"If we are here today, we are here wholeheartedly to support you so that our community will see more development,\" Nana Sinapem II expressed.\n\nIn reaction, Dr. Bawumia thanked the Traditional Council for their endorsement and assured them that, if elected, he would continue to work diligently to implement his policies and deliver on his promises to Ghanaians.","image":"https://cdn.modernghana.com/images/content/1014202415249-h41o2s6fey-338355210478540.jpg","eventUri":"eng-9991084","sentiment":0.5137,"wgt":466615053,"relevance":1,"source_uri":"modernghana.com","source_dataType":"news","source_title":"Modern Ghana Media Communication Ltd.","author_uri":"gideon_afful_amoako@modernghana.com","author_name":"Gideon Afful Amoako","author_type":"author","author_isAgency":false},{"uri":"8363174994","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2024-10-14","time":"15:08:54","dateTime":"2024-10-14T15:08:54Z","dateTimePub":"2024-10-14T15:08:21Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://peacenow.org:443/entry.php?id=43568","title":"Legislative Round-Up- October 11, 2024","body":"Produced by the Foundation for Middle East Peace.

Selected Media & Press releases/Statements\n\nOctober 7, 2023 anniversary\n\nMany, many members of Congress issued statements or published social media posts expressing support for/solidarity with Israel on the anniversary of the 10/7/23 Hamas attacks on Israel. Many include language in effect blaming Iran for the 10/7 attacks. Some explicitly or implicitly frame the Hamas attack as an attack on the Jewish people (as opposed to on Israel/Israelis). Many include support for Israel's war on Gaza, its war on Lebanon, and its impending attack on Iran. Many talk about the imperative for the US to stand with Israel until \"victory\" Many talk about Israeli hostages and the imperative to save them, notwithstanding the fact that the Israeli government appears to have long ago written them off as necessary collateral damage in its war on Gaza. A very small number mention Palestinian suffering and casualties, or anything about restraint, de-escalation, ceasefire, concern over regional war, or criticize the Israeli govt, etc.... Some use the anniversary to double down on conflating protest of Israel/Zionism/Israel's actions post-Oct 7, especially on US campuses, with antisemitism and vowed to shut down such protests.

The majority of the people in the affected communities in North Carolina and Florida voted for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in 2020, making some election analysts wonder if some Trump supporters will be able to cast their ballots.\n\nAmy Lieberman, a politics and society editor at The Conversation U.S., spoke with Boris Heersink, a scholar of voters' behavior after a natural disaster, to better understand if and how the recent hurricanes could shift the results of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nA massive hurricane disrupts people's lives in many important ways, including affecting people's personal safety and where they can live. Ahead of an election, there are a lot of practical limitations about how an election can be executed - like if a person can still receive mail-in ballots at home or elsewhere, or if it is possible to still vote in person at their polling location if that building was destroyed or damaged.\n\nAnother issue is whether people who have just lived through a natural disaster and will likely be dealing with the aftermath for weeks to come are focused on politics right now. Some might sit out the election because they simply have more important things to worry about.\n\nThe other side of the equation, which is what political scientists like myself are mostly focusing on, is whether people take the fact that a natural disaster happened into consideration when they vote.\n\nTwo scholars, Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels, have argued that sometimes voters are not great at figuring out how to incorporate bad things that happened to them into a voting position. In some cases, it is entirely fair to hold an elected official responsible for bad outcomes that affect people's lives. But at other moments, bad things can happen to us without that being the fault of an incumbent president or governor. And voters should ideally be able to balance out these different types of bad things - those it is fair to punish elected officials for, and those for which it isn't fair to hold them responsible.\n\nAfter all, a devastating hurricane is terrible, but it is not Kamala Harris' fault that it happened. But Achen and Bartels argue that voters frequently still punish elected officials for random bad events like this.\n\nTheir most famous example is the consequences of a series of shark attacks off the New Jersey coast in the summer of 1916. As a result of those attacks, the New Jersey tourism industry saw a major decline. While these findings are still being debated, Achen and Bartels argue that Jersey shore voters subsequently voted against Woodrow Wilson in the 1916 presidential election at a higher rate than they would have had the shark attacks not happened. They argue that voters did this even though Wilson had no involvement in the shark attacks.\n\nScholars like John Gasper and Andrew Reeves argue that voters mostly care whether elected officials respond appropriately to a disaster. So, if the president does a good job reacting, voters do not actually punish them at all in the next election. However, voters can punish elected officials if they feel like the response is not correct.\n\nThe fact that Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana in 2005 was not the fault of then-President George W. Bush. But the perceived slowness of the government response is something a voter could have held him responsible for.\n\nColleagues and I have shown that how people interpret the combination of a disaster and the government response is likely colored by their own partisanship.\n\nWe looked at both the effects of Superstorm Sandy on the 2012 presidential election and natural disasters' impact on elections more broadly from 1972 through 2004. One core finding is that when presidents reject state officials' disaster declaration requests, they lose votes in affected counties - but only if those counties were already more supportive of the opposite party.\n\nIf there is a strong positive government response, the incumbent president or their party can actually gain votes or lose voters affected by a disaster. So, Republicans affected by the hurricanes could become more inclined to vote against Harris if they feel like they are not getting the help they need. But it could also help Harris if affected Democrats feel like they are getting enough aid.\n\nThe major takeaway is that if the government responds really effectively to a natural disaster or other emergency, there is not a huge electoral penalty - and there could even be a small reward.\n\nThat is not irrelevant in a close election. If Republicans in affected areas in North Carolina feel the government response has been poor and it inspires them to turn out in higher numbers to punish Harris, that could matter. But if they feel like the response has been adequate, research suggests either no real effect on their support for Harris - or possibly even an increase in Harris voters.\n\nScholars mostly assume that people affected can tell whether the government response was good or not. Trump and other Republicans are falsely saying that the response is slow and falsely claiming that Federal Emergency Management Agency money is being spent on immigrants who are not living in the country legally. There does not appear to be a slow government response to the hurricane in North Carolina, and there's no evidence the response is insufficient in Florida, either.\n\nSo, the question now is whether voters affected by these hurricanes will respond based on their actual lived experiences, or how they are told they are living their experience.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and trustworthy analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.

Whether you're a Charli XCX stan or voting blue this November, here's why it carries importance.\n\nA diverse electorate of nearly 41 million \"young voters,\" according t0 Tufts University, will shape the 2024 presidential election this year. This is electrifying news for the Democratic Party, which has recently stirred the pot with President Biden's drop from the race and the Democratic Party nominating current Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nA recent study conducted by SSRS for CNN found that nearly 75% of voters in the United States believed the Democratic Party would have a better chance at winning the presidency in 2024 with someone other than Joe Biden at the forefront of the ballot.\n\nHarris is nipping at former President Trump's heels in a hypothetical showdown. Trump is polling at 46% among registered voters while Harris is at 49% according to a New York Times poll from Oct. 11, which means an Olympic contest on our hands as we advance closer to the 2024 election.\n\nHarris's edge over Trump is fueled largely by a surge in support from women. Polling data reveals that 50% of female voters prefer Harris over Trump when compared to 44% who favored Biden over the same combatant, suggesting a photo finish come November. When University of Oregon students were approached on the matter, the prospect of a female president held great allure.\n\n\"The appeal that a woman can be anything she wants to be. That is what 'brat' means to me.\" UO journalism master's candidate Saida Guzman said. This year's election might be one of the most important elections to date. At least, for the sake of democracy.\n\n\"A woman can do whatever the fuck a man can do, and can probably do it better. Not only a woman but a woman of color. That would be so phenomenal,\" UO student Abby Snethen said when asked about the potential of a female candidate claiming this year's election.\n\nWhen it comes to issues about human rights, climate change and solving economic inequality, Harris's plentiful progressive priorities are held in high esteem by the Gen Z demographic.\n\n\"Her influence now on social media is not like we've seen before. It's a unique approach and is definitely helpful,\" Guzman said.\n\nAt 59 years young, Harris appeals to UO students as a highly receptive lead for defending the values of tomorrow through her leadership today. Certainly, her social media appeal can only bolster these positive reactions for her campaign.\n\nHer personal story of resilience and diversity offers a refreshing, unapologetic narrative that compels a generation to continue the fight for equal representation in the most salient matters of today's political agenda.\n\nBut, the question remains: can she convert TikTok likes and internet fame into actionable change? I'd say the answer is a resounding \"yes.\" Harris's youthful, bubbly, spirited campaign trail online has active Democratic supporters gushing over the idea of a \"Femininomenon\" era of politics.\n\nOn X, TikTok and Instagram, her popularity has flourished, cultivating a deeper presence about just how special it is to be a woman in a position of power. Further data from the University of Georgia concludes Harris' suggestive take is outnumbering Trump's Twitter finger days, concluding that her internet fame may take her places further than a few X followers.\n\nThe iconic neon \"brat\" meme might just give her the green light to a president-elect position, garnering publicity on all platforms as it coincides with all the right moves that the Biden-Harris administration has made surrounding lowered prescription drug costs, veteran healthcare services and modernized infrastructure initiatives.\n\nIt's to be decided if the stars align in November in the same way they propelled Harris into the Gen Z quick-switch gaze, but we'll stay resharing her image with fellow digital nomads in high hopes.\n\nThe epic crossover between Madam Vice President and artists such as Charli XCX and Chappell Roan is one for the history books -- and the culture. While her internet campaign continues to reach new heights, it's imperative to understand the raw influence Harris imposes on Gen Z cyber-dwellers, beyond the context of all in which we live.","image":"http://dailyemerald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024.10.10.EMG_.KL_.Kamala_is_brat-4.jpg","sentiment":0.3569,"wgt":466612913,"relevance":1,"source_uri":"dailyemerald.com","source_dataType":"news","source_title":"Daily Emerald","author_uri":"brianna_carrasquillo@dailyemerald.com","author_name":"Brianna Carrasquillo","author_type":"author","author_isAgency":false},{"uri":"8363129026","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2024-10-14","time":"14:35:37","dateTime":"2024-10-14T14:35:37Z","dateTimePub":"2024-10-14T14:35:09Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.6275,"url":"https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/films/1961842/Donald-Trump-new-Trump-movie-The-Apprentice","title":"Donald Trump slams 'disgusting' new Trump movie biopic 'made by human scum'","body":"The Apprentice international trailer trailing Donald Trump\n\nDonald Trump has slammed the new movie biopic about his youth working in New York real estate during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nSebastain Stan stars as young Trump in The Apprentice as he's mentored by lawyer Roy Cohn, who is played by Succession's Jeremy Strong.\n\nThe controversial new film, which Clint Eastwood turned down, has received a strong reaction from the former president himself on Truth Social.\n\nTrump lambasted: \"A FAKE and CLASSLESS Movie written about me, called, The Apprentice (Do they even have the right to use that name without approval?), will hopefully bomb.

The election, featuring Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, presents a unique scenario for the cryptocurrency market.\n\nWhat Happened: Despite the election's proximity, the crypto market remains stable. Bitcoin's price has fluctuated between $55,000 and $65,000 over the past three months, marking a modest 6% increase. This stability follows a spike in July when Trump was shot at a rally, boosting his election prospects, and President Joe Biden subsequently withdrew, endorsing Harris, Barron's reported on Monday.\n\nBrett Reeves from BitGo believes Harris's candidacy has balanced the crypto market. Meanwhile, Gregory Benhaim from 3iQ predicts a Trump win could temporarily boost Bitcoin prices, though legislative challenges might arise without a Republican Congress majority. Conversely, Harris's victory could lead to a more volatile market, despite her recent support for crypto as a future industry.\n\nSee Also: Gary Gensler Doubts Cryptocurrency Future, Says Leading Figures Are Either In Jail Or Awaiting Extradition\n\nBenhaim views the election as a long-term win for Bitcoin, given neither candidate plans to address the U.S. debt, enhancing Bitcoin's appeal over fiat currency.\n\n\"I'm really not looking at this election as a make-or-break moment for Bitcoin or digital assets as a whole,\" he said.\n\nWhy It Matters: Trump recently announced the launch of a token sale for his decentralized finance project, World Liberty Financial, emphasizing his commitment to the crypto space.\n\nAnalysts from Bernstein suggest that a Trump victory could propel Bitcoin to new highs, potentially reaching $80,000 to $90,000. Conversely, a Harris win might lead to a decline in Bitcoin's value. Additionally, Anthony Scaramucci praised Trump for shifting the crypto debate, forcing Democrats to reconsider their stance on cryptocurrencies, which could benefit the industry in the long run.\n\nRead Next:\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin See Friday Gains, But Trader Warns '$59,000 Must Hold, No Major Moves Expected This Weekend'\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThis story was generated using Benzinga Neuro and edited by Pooja Rajkumari\n\nMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs","image":"https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2024/10/14/Recent-Debates_0.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&fit=crop","sentiment":0.2314,"wgt":466611698,"relevance":1,"source_uri":"benzinga.com","source_dataType":"news","source_title":"Benzinga","author_uri":"benzinga_neuro@benzinga.com","author_name":"Benzinga Neuro","author_type":"author","author_isAgency":false},{"uri":"8363107106","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2024-10-14","time":"14:19:07","dateTime":"2024-10-14T14:19:07Z","dateTimePub":"2024-10-14T14:18:44Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenamcgregor/2024/10/14/as-election-season-comes-to-the-office-brace-for-the-day-and-weeks-that-follow/","title":"As Election Season Comes To The Office, Brace For The Day -- And Weeks -- That Follow","body":"This week's Future of Work newsletter examines how leaders can navigate the divisiveness of election season, interviews Indeed's CEO about the job market and dives into news about the workforce.\n\nThis is the published version of Forbes' Future of Work newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief human resources officers and other talent managers on disruptive technologies, managing the workforce and trends in the remote work debate. Click here to get it delivered to your inbox every Monday!\n\nhe 2024 presidential election is just 22 days away. And we all know what that means: More divisive conversations in the hallways, questions about rights and privileges when it comes to free speech at work, and yet another reason many workers don't want to come back to the office. An Owl Labs survey of 2,000 full-time U.S. workers found that 45% said their employers' or colleagues' political opinions have made them not want to go to the office.\n\nAs is common at this point in an election year, we'll hear plenty of advice for how executive leaders can manage the run-up to November 5: from helping employees develop civil discourse skills, to navigating the polarization around DEI and facilitating productive conflict. But one issue has gotten less attention: how to deal with the day after.\n\nDepending on the makeup of your workforce, half or more may be unhappy with the election results -- that is, if we have results the following day -- and being in the office around others could present some challenges. Contributor Bryan Robinson suggests employers should honor work-from-home requests that day, giving people space to choose where they'll be able to do their best work.\n\nAt the very least, we hope everyone is encouraging workers to vote -- and giving them time off to do so. HR Executive cites a survey from workforce data provider Brightmine which found that even though 31 states have policies mandating workers get time off to vote, less than a third of workers say their employer offers voting-leave policies, and only 28% of the 2,000 Americans surveyed have used voting time off to cast a ballot in an election.\n\nBoeing said last week it has withdrawn a pay raise offer made to its striking factory workers after negotiations between both sides fell apart, extending a major work stoppage. Stephanie Pope, the president and CEO of Boeing's Commercial Airplanes division, said the plane maker \"bargained in good faith\" and offered \"increases in take-home pay and retirement,\" while the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) -- which represents the 33,000 striking workers -- issued its own statement, saying Boeing was \"hell-bent on standing on the non-negotiated offer.\" Then Friday, the aerospace firm announced it would cut 10% of its workforce in the coming months, or about 17,000 jobs, including executives and managers.\n\nKate Ryder, founder and CEO of women's health startup Maven Clinic, is trying to disrupt the current cost model of infertility care by offering employers a payment platform that charges a flat fee to route women through the journey that's best for them. \"We just charge one fixed fee, which means that we can really sit there with the patient and try to understand what's best for her based on her medical history, her financial situation, and what she wants,\" Ryder told Forbes' Maggie McGrath. Last week, Maven Clinic raised a $125 million Series F round led by StepStone Group at a $1.7 billion valuation. Check out more from Ryder's interview with McGrath.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said last week he supports the end of \"double taxation\" for Americans who live overseas, according to multiple outlets, marking his latest tax cut proposal in the leadup to the election. The change to the tax code could specifically unburden higher income Americans with investments who pay taxes for both the U.S. and the place where they reside.\n\nAmid the ongoing furor over remote and hybrid work, two surveys show how much employers want people back -- and that employees don't want to follow the mandates. HR Dive published a survey by Robert Half in June finding that two out of three managers said they would be willing to increase salaries for new hires who work in an office. Meanwhile another survey from Resume Builder found that one in five workers say they aren't following their company's mandate, with about half saying they'll quit if their company enforces RTO compliance.\n\nAmid softer hiring, AI's impact and surprising news about recent jobs numbers that shattered economists' estimates -- Forbes spoke with Indeed CEO Chris Hyams about what he's seeing in the job market, the platform's evolving business and how AI is changing the experience for recruiters and candidates. Excerpts from our conversation have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAs we look ahead to the end of the year, what are you seeing in terms of the number of job postings?\n\nIt is very clear, thematically, looking at our data, that demand has been softening. Still, macro, [it's] above pre-pandemic. We baseline everything to February of 2020. We are, as of last week, I think about 11 or 12% above pre-pandemic levels across the board. It was still a tight hiring market pre-pandemic.\n\nHowever, it is a tale of multiple sectors here. ... If we look at the peak -- a year and a half, two years ago -- overall, we were about 60% above pre-pandemic levels for the entire U.S. market. So the fact that we're down 11 and 12% above pre-pandemic means we're down considerably.\n\nAt the same time, quit rates are down. Churn has come down. When we look at labor force participation, that is actually up, which we think is a good thing. ... There are more people coming into the market and they're going directly onto the unemployment rolls. The way we think of it at a high level is the labor market is strong enough to be attracting people back into it, but not strong enough currently to be placing them all.\n\nHow much of that is economic issues and hiring versus AI?\n\nWe are looking very carefully trying to see where we can prove AI is having this impact on jobs. We have not yet -- and we have a lot of very smart people looking at this -- seen here is a specific instance of \"this job looks like it is going away.\"\n\nIt's not 100% perfect, but it's highly correlated that the areas where AI is more likely to have a higher impact -- those job listings are lower than their peak, relatively speaking, to the more in-person [jobs]. I can't say how much of that is because of boom and bust, or how much of that is the availability of work being able to be done remotely, [or AI].\n\nHowever, in my own assessment ... a job opening is a forward looking assessment of what kind of labor I'm going to need in the future. AI does not have to actually replace any jobs for someone to think I might need less [of them] in the future. I suspect what we are starting to see is people thinking I am less likely to need more people as opposed to AI being capable of doing that person's job.\n\nHow is AI impacting the job search process?\n\nOur focus for the platform is we want to ensure that every job has a human being on the other side who is actually responsive and looking at applications as they come in and every person who's applying to jobs is a human being who's actually seen that job.\n\nWhat we're trying to do is use AI on our side to help people find things that are the best fit for them. So instead of going the other direction, applying to 100 jobs a day, you might apply to one or two of exactly the right jobs where you have a pretty good sense that you're a good fit.\n\nHow is your business changing?\n\nWe started out really as a search engine and we aggregated all the jobs and people came and they searched but then they clicked and they left and went somewhere else. When we do that, it's actually very hard to control for quality. ... So what we've been doing for much of the last 20 years is moving from being just a pure search engine to a real two sided marketplace. The more people engage on the platform, the more dramatic the results. Part of that is going from a quantity to quality focus.\n\nSearch used to be the way job seekers found jobs on Indeed.

It doesn't get bigger than this.\"\n\nElectoral Map\n\nIn an internet first, \"Louder with Crowder\" will be licensing data directly from the leader in election data reporting, Edison Research / National Election Pool via Reuters. This is the same API data utilized by national media outlets including ABC, CBS, CNN, and NBC News. This will allow Crowder with his research and data analysis team to bypass traditional media and report directly to stream viewers, including state calling, using primary sourcing. Crowder's unique live API-powered Electoral Map will be available to viewers and partner creators throughout the stream.\n\nElection Integrity Map\n\nCrowder's stream will feature a cutting-edge crowdsourced Election Integrity Map, using real-time qualitative data vetted and verified live by in-house journalist-moderators. The Election Integrity Map will display live video and photographic reports submitted by citizen journalists, highlighting election anomalies coast to coast.\n\n'MugClub Undercover' Investigative Journalism\n\nCrowder will have boots on the ground from his investigative journalism unit, Mug Club Undercover, in crucial swing states leading up to and throughout the Presidential Election. Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Arizona are just a few of the key states where Crowder will have journalists embedded. Their investigative reporting will allow Crowder to break exclusive stories throughout the mega-stream.\n\nMug Club Army\n\nCrowder's election night coverage will enlist reporting, as well as real-time digital and street promotion by several thousand citizen journalists and volunteers that make up the ranks of Crowder's 'MugClub Army' which he launched in April of this year. The Mug Club Army was created to help ensure dishonesty and trickery have no place in the 2024 Presidential Election.\n\nSimul-Stream Hosts and Featured Guests\n\nThroughout the \"Election Livestream of the Century,\" Crowder will \"simul-stream\" with other top content creators in the news and political space. Election coverage partners and guests include Dan Bongino, Piers Morgan, Russell Brand, Patrick Bet-David, Tim Pool, The Quartering, Alex Jones, Clay Travis, Roseanne, and more to be announced. Additional musical performances will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\nCrowder has vowed to keep his stream live until the election is officially called.\n\n\"Election 2024 will be the single biggest and most consequential event in this company's history,\" said Crowder. \"And it's only possible because of the unwavering support of Mug Club.\"\n\nMarketing for Crowder's \"Election Livestream of the Century\" will include a sixty-foot by sixty-foot digital spectacular billboard in the heart of New York's Times Square and a mini-documentary series featuring a behind the scenes look at the creation of Crowder's biggest livestream yet.\n\nCrowder's \"Election Livestream of the Century\" comes on the heels of his 2020 election night stream which amassed 17 million views across all platforms with top concurrent live YouTube viewership exceeding 500 thousand, and his 2016 election night stream which garnered Crowder 20 thousand new paid subscribers to his Mug Club community.\n\nMug Club Undercover has made global headlines since its launch in the fall of 2023 when Crowder exclusively obtained and published manifesto writings from the Nashville Covenant School shooter, which led to a legal battle over the full Nashville Manifesto and subsequent release of the shooter Audrey Hale's second journal.\n\nIn the past month, Crowder's investigative team broke two major national stories: On Sept. 5, Crowder released exclusive Mug Club Undercover footage of the Southern District of New York Spokesman exposing Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's prosecution of President Donald Trump as a politically motivated \"perversion of justice.\" Crowder's reporting led to a delay in Trump's sentencing until after the Election.\n\nThe following week, Crowder again made headlines with his Mug Club Undercover exposé and subsequent confrontation of former New York City Covid Czar, Dr. Jay Varma who admitted to participating in underground sex parties while forcing Covid lockdown policies on New Yorkers under Mayor Bill de Blasio. The Mug Club Undercover releases prompted multiple investigations into Varma's and The City's handling of the Covid response, and into SIGA Technologies which employed Varma.\n\nIn March 2023, Crowder announced his current partnership with Rumble, which exclusively manages Mug Club content. \"Crowder played a huge role in driving our growth in viewership during the U.S. midterm election in November 2022,\" Rumble Chairman and CEO Chris Pavlovski said at the time. \"We are excited to capitalize on our opportunity in news and political commentary content as we lead up to the U.S. Presidential Election in 2024.\"\n\nView original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/steven-crowder-to-host-election-livestream-of-the-century-the-rumble-on-rumble-302275210.html","sentiment":0.0902,"wgt":466611227,"relevance":1,"source_uri":"itnewsonline.com","source_dataType":"news","source_title":"IT News Online"},{"uri":"2024-10-514549919","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2024-10-14","time":"14:07:26","dateTime":"2024-10-14T14:07:26Z","dateTimePub":"2024-10-14T13:54:46Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.4706,"url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-tantrums-over-apprentice-biopic-135446808.html","title":"Trump tantrums over 'Apprentice' biopic in middle-of-the-night rant: A 'fake' and 'classless' movie","body":"Donald Trump threw a middle-of-the-night tantrum to slam a new biopic about his life as a \"fake\" and \"classless\" movie.\n\n\"A FAKE and CLASSLESS Movie written about me, called, The Apprentice (Do they even have the right to use that name without approval?), will hopefully 'bomb.'

The 68-year-old actor took center stage, sharing his thoughts on \"the freedom of choice,\" while emphasizing his personal connection as the father of a daughter.\n\n\"I am not a politician. I am not a doctor or a lawyer, but I played all of those on TV. But I am a father of a daughter, and it's important to me for her life now, for the future other father's daughters to be able to have within their lifetime the fundamental right, freedom of choice,\" Cranston said at the event.\n\nIn June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court made a historic decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, effectively upholding a Mississippi law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. This ruling struck down the constitutional protections for abortion rights that had been in place for nearly 50 years.\n\nThe original 1973 Roe decision had affirmed the constitutional right to access abortion care, making this reversal a significant shift in legal precedent.\n\n\"There should not be anyone but them deciding what happens to their own bodies. And that's why I am enthusiastically supporting Vice President Harris and Governor Walz.\"\n\nThe actor praised Harris's dedication to issues like freedom of choice and reproductive rights, signaling his belief in her vision for America's future.\n\nBryan Cranston had high praise for Kamala Harris, commending her for bringing a sense of optimism back into American politics. He expressed his appreciation for \"Kamala for bringing back optimism and fighting cynicism and animosity in Washington,\" adding that he firmly believes she is the best candidate to lead the country forward.\n\nThe \"Breaking Bad\" actor went on to say he has no doubt that \"she will be a terrific president,\" voicing his strong support for Harris's leadership potential.\n\nFans' opinions on his endorsement were mixed, with one X user expressing, \"Well, Bryan Cranston, that's disappointing,\" while another praised the actor. \"Smart man ...Bryan Cranston,\" they said.\n\nKamala Harris entered the presidential race with a strong commitment to \"restore reproductive freedom.\" Her campaign clarified that she is specifically advocating for the restoration of Roe v. Wade.\n\nAccording to a statement given to POLITICO, the Harris campaign reaffirmed that her stance, as expressed in a September interview on Face the Nation, remains unchanged -- she continues to support restoring Roe, which protected abortion rights up until the point of fetal viability, typically around 22 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n\"I am being precise. We need to put into law the protections of Roe v. Wade,\" Harris said at the time. \"And that is about going back to where we were before the Dobbs decision.\"\n\nBryan Cranston has joined the long list of celebrities who have publicly endorsed Kamala Harris, including Taylor Swift, who announced her presidential pick shortly after the Donald Trump vs Kamala Harris debate last month.\n\n\"I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election,\" the \"Love Story\" singer announced. \"I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.\"\n\n\"Newsies\" star Jeremy Jordan, \"The Little Mermaid\" actress Halle Bailey, former NBA star Magic Johnson, and \"Road House\" star Sam Elliot have also publicly endorsed Kamala Harris.","image":"https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/brand-img/123/1300x600/2024/10/14091205/bryan-cranston-kamala-harris.jpg?","eventUri":"eng-9991786","sentiment":0.3098,"wgt":466609970,"relevance":1,"source_uri":"theblast.com","source_dataType":"news","source_title":"The Blast","author_uri":"kelly_coffey_behrens@theblast.com","author_name":"Kelly Coffey-Behrens","author_type":"author","author_isAgency":false},{"uri":"2024-10-514527308","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2024-10-14","time":"13:45:47","dateTime":"2024-10-14T13:45:47Z","dateTimePub":"2024-10-14T13:42:25Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.8118,"url":"https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/4931902-aapi-survey-immigration/","title":"AAPI adults more likely to view legal immigration as asset to US: Survey","body":"Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (AAPI) adults are more likely than the rest of the U.S. population to view immigration as an asset to the country, a new survey found.\n\nAccording to the survey, released Monday by AAPI Data and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs, about 80 percent of AAPI adults say legal immigration to the U.S. a \"major benefit\" that contributes to economic growth.\n\nBy comparison, just 42 percent of U.S. adults overall say immigrants contribute to economic growth.\n\nAAPI adults were more likely to be favorable about other aspects of immigration, too.\n\nSixty-one percent of AAPI adults say immigrants enrich American culture and values while 38 percent of the overall population says the same.\n\nAnd more than 50 percent of AAPI adults say immigrants take jobs Americans don't want compared to 35 percent of the general population who agrees.\n\nAAPI adults were also much more likely to say immigrants provide American companies with the expertise of skilled workers in science and technology fields.\n\nAAPI adults, however, were much less likely to say the country is benefitting from immigrants who arrive in the country illegally when asked the same questions.\n\nThe survey was released just before the 2024 presidential election, where immigration is a main focus as former President Trump seeks to criticize Vice President Harris over the Biden administration's response to the influx of migrants arriving at the country's southern border in recent years.\n\nThe new poll was conducted Sept. 3-9 among 1,123 AAPI Americans.

They passed it two years ago, and it makes it harder to object to certifying election results on January 6, 2025 and beyond.\n\nSome Trump allies have argued that's unconstitutional. The House speaker hasn't taken a clear position. Should Congress follow that law in certifying the 2024 presidential election?\n\nREP. BYRON DONALDS: Look, I think, when you're talking about the election this November, the thing people want is that local jurisdictions follow the law passed by the states.\n\nAs long as everybody does that, there's not going to be any problem certifying this election this November. But what really matters about this election are the issues facing the American people, not the Electoral College Count Act, because what we need is a president who's going to secure our border, actually make our foreign policy be strong again and make sense again. That's what matters.\n\nBASH: Right. But my question is, are you going to follow the new law? Are you going to follow the new law about certifying the election?\n\nDONALDS: As long -- and I have been very clear, Dana. As long as states and jurisdictions follow election procedures in their states, there will be no problem for me or anybody on Capitol Hill.\n\nBASH: All right, well, that's a giant loophole that you're leaving there, which -- there's no evidence that that has not happened. It didn't happen in 2020.\n\nDONALDS: That's not a loophole. That's actually not a loophole, Dana, and if you look at what happened in Pennsylvania, Arizona, and other jurisdictions...\n\nBASH: There's absolutely -- Congressman...\n\nDONALDS: ... in 2020, they did not follow election procedures passed by the state legislature. That's an empirical fact.\n\nBASH: There is no evidence of widespread fraud. That went through, what, 60 court cases, and even Bill Barr, the former president...\n\nDONALDS: Dana, I did not say fraud. You said fraud.\n\nWhat I'm talking about -- and if you want to talk about it, let's be clear.

Biden spoke to TIME for a while before dropping out of the race,\" they added in that article.\n\nCritics, especially pro-MAGA social media accounts, have questioned Harris' media strategy ahead of the election.\n\nThere are only 22 days until the election next month and Harris has not yet made the full push on media appearances as most candidates do in the run-up to Election Day.\n\nVP Harris's media strategy has been questioned by critics after she rejected a number of mainstream and traditional media outlets in favor of more alternative media, such as the raunchy, sex-oriented podcast Call Her Daddy.\n\nThe VP has conducted some questionable interviews, such as with the raunchy and sex-oriented podcast Call Her Daddy.

Read the first and second story.\n\nFor years, an extremist far-right movement has worked to transform one of California's most conservative regions. Since gaining a majority on Shasta county's governing body, they have managed to spark an exodus of government workers, attempted to do away with the voting system and fought the state over policies pertaining to Covid-19 and the second amendment.\n\nEarlier this year, voters in the community of 180,000 - perhaps tired of Shasta's national notoriety as a hotbed for extremist politics and election denialism - declared they had had enough. In a stunning rebuke, they voted out a far-right leader by an enormous margin, handing his seat to a political newcomer.\n\nMatt Plummer, a Yale-educated former college football player who owns a corporate training business, pledged to provide an alternative to the \"hostility and division\" tearing Shasta apart. Supporters view Plummer, with his focus on issues such as crime, roads and homelessness, as someone who can help the community chart a path out of the upheaval.\n\nBut others are concerned about Plummer's connection to another powerful and ultra-conservative force that has reshaped the region: Bethel church. The megachurch has more than 11,000 members, including Plummer, and a school of \"supernatural ministry\" that serves 2,000 students a year.\n\nBethel leaders once said that God wanted Donald Trump to have a second term and have claimed that Joe Biden won the 2020 election by \"fraud\". Church members have become major players in local government - three of the five members on the city council in Redding, the county seat, attend Bethel. The city's vice-mayor is a church elder.\n\nThe church is involved in nearly every part of Shasta county, and is a cornerstone of the local economy, said Doni Chamberlain, a longtime local journalist and chronicler of the area.\n\nShasta's extreme political landscape has forced residents to choose between a toxic rightwing movement and a church that also has deeply conservative and extreme beliefs, she said.\n\n\"This is the bind we're in,\" she said. \"Shasta county is in this weird extremist sandwich where we have the rightwing pushing for guns and splitting the state. And there is the other extreme side of the sandwich that is Bethel church. Then the middle where people are trying to figure out how to survive in this place.\"\n\n***\n\nBefore Shasta county garnered national attention for its fierce opposition to Covid-19 restrictions and efforts to institute a hand-count voting system favored by those who believe lies about election fraud, it was Bethel church that raised the region's profile.\n\nThere are churches - of which Shasta county has plenty - and then there is Bethel, a behemoth institution without parallel in the area. First established in a private home in 1952, it now has more than 11,000 members - more than 10% of the population in the city of Redding - where the church is based.\n\nBethel's transformation came under the direction of Bill Johnson, the son of a long-serving pastor who began leading the church with Beni, his wife, in 1996. The church has grown significantly, opening a school, a youth outreach program and Bethel Music, a record label that produces popular worship music and reported $18m in revenue in 2023. Justin Bieber is a fan and has filmed himself covering a song from a Bethel artist. Today several of Johnson's children work as senior leaders in the church.\n\nBut it's Bethel's school of supernatural ministry, which has been called a \"Christian Hogwarts\", that is often credited with its growth. The program was founded by Kris and Kathy Vallotton, the senior leaders of the church, and teaches students that they can perform miracles and heal through prayer. \"Students will learn how to read, understand, and 'do' the Bible, how to practice His presence, to witness, heal the sick, prophesy, preach, pray, cast out demons and much more,\" the school website states.\n\nRelated: How an ultra-right majority in California's far north picked a novice to run its elections\n\nPeople travel to Redding from around the world, more than 100 countries, to attend the vocational program. Students have been known to approach people in the city, particularly those in casts or with walkers, to offer prayers for healing. The focus on \"supernatural power\" is fundamental to the church, which in 2019 asked members to pray for the resurrection of a two-year-old girl.\n\nBethel has long believed in the power of healing people through prayer. Chamberlain joined the church as a child after her mother died and her siblings were adopted by a local couple who were members. When they learned that Chamberlain and her twin sister had a neurological disorder that caused involuntary movements, church elders came to treat their \"demons\" and the children were made to throw away their medications, Chamberlain recalled.\n\n\"When you have a bunch of adults circling around you and putting their hands on your heads and shaking you, it was pretty intimidating,\" she said, adding that they coached her on how to speak in tongues.\n\n\"It's like being waterboarded, you just give up and give in so they leave you alone. Then you're in the club.\"\n\nSince its founding in 1998, Bethel's supernatural school has brought thousands of people to Redding. They are a visible presence around the city, in its grocery stores and the hip cafes and bakeries operated by Bethel members. And as the church's footprint has grown, so too has criticism of its role.\n\nSupporters say the church has been a positive force in Redding and that it's natural for a large institution to attract scrutiny but that members want to be a part of the community in which they live. They often point to local volunteer work or when the church donated money to fund police positions in Redding and began leasing the local auditorium when it appeared the city would have to close it down.\n\nBethel did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nBut other Shasta county residents argue the church has changed the fabric of the community and worsened an existing housing shortage by drawing thousands of students to the area while driving up costs.\n\n\"If you look from the outside in, there seems to be positives. They've done good things, but I don't feel like on balance what they've done is for the good of the community in general,\" said Robert Sid, a Shasta county resident who supported Plummer. \"Their Hogwarts supernatural ministry has really played into flooding the market and artificially pricing things that the regular Redding person can't afford.\"\n\nCritics have expressed discomfort with church members who hold key positions in local government voting on proposals from Bethel to expand. Some residents have joined a Facebook group to identify businesses connected to the church.\n\n\"[The owners] tithe to the church. If you patronize a Bethel-affiliated business then now some of those profits are being tithed to the church. You're kind of indirectly supporting the church by doing that,\" said Rachel Strickland, who started the group. \"People don't want to do that.\"\n\nAnd for some in this deeply conservative region, where Republicans outnumber Democrats two to one, the church's political ties have been cause for concern as well. Religious experts have described it as closely related to the New Apostolic Reformation, a movement built around the idea of modern-day prophets and apostles that aims to have Christians transform society and rule over key political and cultural institutions, referred to as the \"Seven Mountain Mandate\".\n\nJohnson co-authored a book, Invading Babylon: the 7 Mountain Mandate, which advises Christians to exert influence in seven core areas: church, family, education, government, media, arts and commerce.\n\nMatthew D Taylor, a senior scholar at the Institute for Islamic, Christian and Jewish studies who has studied Bethel, argued that the church appears to be trying to implement the Seven Mountain Mandate in its community.\n\nRelated: Extremist politics divided this conservative California community. What will it take to turn the tide?\n\n\"I think they very much intend to enact this bigger vision of Christian supremacy and Christian dominance in the Redding area. It doesn't mean they are always overt about that,\" said Taylor, the author of a book on the New Apostolic Reformation for which he interviewed Johnson.\n\nBethel leaders endorsed Donald Trump, and in 2021 one apologized for incorrectly prophesying that he would win a second term. The church has come out against efforts to restrict conversion therapy. In 2019, several figures associated with the church attended an Oval Office event with Trump to pray over the president. Bethel has sought to distance itself from January 6, however, Taylor said.\n\n\"They are trying to tone down public rhetoric and make themselves [seem] less extreme than they are but as far as I can tell they haven't moderated their extremism. They are just trying to package it in a better way,\" he argued.\n\nThe church has long emphasized that the beliefs of individual church members are not necessarily reflective of the church's positions. Chamberlain, who left the church as a young adult, argues it is important to distinguish between the church leadership and its members.\n\n\"You have to separate the leaders of the church, the people who are millionaires and drive expensive cars, cars that cost as much as somebody might pay for a house. They have vacation homes and eat at The French Laundry,\" Chamberlain said.\n\nThey live a life of the rich and famous, she added, while some Bethel members, and students, leave their homes abroad and live in extreme poverty to be close to the church.\n\nMembers point out that they are not a monolith.\n\nMatt Plummer's journey to Redding began the same way thousands of others have - with Bethel. He moved to the city in 2016 with his wife and daughters to attend the church, and remains a member, he said in an interview with the Guardian.\n\nPlummer, who grew up in rural New Jersey where his first job was on a horse farm, was drawn to the region's access to nature from hiking to swimming holes, he said, and the family has developed deep ties to the area.\n\nHe decided to run for the board of supervisors after working in several political campaigns and seeing the intense polarization and problems that have plagued Shasta county.\n\n\"We have tied basically for the highest suicide rate in the state. You have one of the highest rates of childhood trauma and one of the highest rates of kids being born with drug withdrawal effects,\" he said. \"This is a pretty cool community that has a lot to offer but at the same time if you look at all these dimensions of what makes a community thrive, we're trailing.\"\n\nHe had a tough race ahead of him seeking to unseat Patrick Jones, who previously served on the Redding city council and had been a supervisor for three years as well as a leader of the anti-establishment movement that has come to define local politics.\n\nJones, a gun store manager, led some of the county's most controversial efforts, including attempting to upend the voting system and moving to allow people to carry firearms in public buildings in violation of state law. He also spread conspiracy theories, telling a conservative national news outlet: \"Elections have been manipulated at the county level for decades.\"\n\nHe once responded to a reporter's query by telling them to \"drop dead\".\n\nWhile polarizing, Jones was well-known and had been in politics for years, Plummer said, and had the backing of a Connecticut magnate who has poured millions of dollars into local elections.\n\nPlummer made up for that by making personal contact, and personally knocked on about 9,000 doors, he said (there are about 23,000 registered voters in his district).\n\n\"People care if you show up and meet them,\" he said.\n\nHe sought to stay out of ideological debates and focus on what residents were worried about, primarily public safety, roads and homelessness. The number of unhoused residents has grown significantly in recent years from 793 in 2022 to 1,013 people in 2023.\n\n\"My opponent had been on the board almost four years and he had been on city council for eight years, which had some jurisdiction over the same things. And they had all gotten worse,\" he said.\n\nHis affiliation with Bethel was a concern, he acknowledged, one he tried to address and alleviate. \"I'm not speaking on stage and not this type of celebrity at Bethel. I just go there on a Sunday morning.\"\n\n\"One of the things I said is: 'I'm not running to represent Bethel and so my job is not to defend Bethel' and so when people would attack Bethel for things, I'd say OK, that's fine. That's actually not my priority here,\" he said.\n\nStrickland, who has described Bethel as a cult, said the choice put the community in a tough position, but that even in her Facebook group people seemed to be leaning toward Plummer. \"For me Patrick Jones is much more dangerous.\"\n\nPlummer received the endorsement of Chamberlain's publication, A News Cafe, drawing backlash from some readers who started referring to the outlet as Bethel Cafe.\n\n\"It was a tough call. I have a problem with Bethel on a lot of levels, but just kind of putting on your thinking cap sometimes the Bethel candidates were the best choice for the positions,\" she said.\n\n\"Do we vote for Patrick Jones who is pushing guns and open carry? Or do we vote for Matt Plummer who is a Bethel member? He's also articulate, educated and smart.\"\n\nAnd in the current political climate in the county, Chamberlain mused, few people would want to subject themselves to running for office. \"The Bethel people are kind of impervious to it. It's scriptural.\"","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/a8305d903d562f5a31298aa7ace567a9","sentiment":0.0902,"wgt":466608322,"relevance":1,"source_uri":"uk.news.yahoo.com","source_dataType":"news","source_title":"Yahoo News UK"},{"uri":"2024-10-514504077","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2024-10-14","time":"13:23:46","dateTime":"2024-10-14T13:23:46Z","dateTimePub":"2024-10-14T13:21:41Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.5373,"url":"https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/4931906-trump-slams-apprentice-film/","title":"Trump rips 'The Apprentice movie as 'disgusting hatchet job'","body":"Former President Trump is slamming \"The Apprentice,\" calling the film about his early rise in New York \"fake and classless.\"\n\n\"It's a cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country,\" Trump wrote in an early morning Truth Social post on Monday.\n\n\"The Apprentice\" marked its opening weekend on Friday, with a release in 1,740 U.S. theaters.

The writer of this pile of garbage, Gabe Sherman, a lowlife and talentless hack, who has long been widely discredited, knew that, but chose to ignore it,\" Trump added. \"So sad that HUMAN SCUM, like the people involved in this hopefully unsuccessful enterprise, are allowed to say and do whatever they want in order to hurt a Political Movement, which is far bigger than any of us. MAGA2024!\"\n\nAbbasi caught wind of Trump's reaction to his movie and issued a response on X, writing: \"Thanks for getting back to us, Donald Trump. I am available to talk further if you want. Today is a tight day with a lot of press for 'The Apprentice,' but I might be able to give you a call tomorrow.\"\n\n\"The Apprentice\" world premiered at Cannes in May.

Polls Live Updates: Trump Gets Another Boost Over Harris After Polls Show Him Gaining - Ny Breaking News","body":"By Katelyn Caralle, senior political reporter and Nick Allen for Dailymail.com\n\nDonald Trump has received another boost with 22 days until the election after a weekend of polls showing him taking away Kamala Harris' national lead.\n\nCNN senior data analyst Harry Enten sounded the alarm for the Harris-Walz ticket for the first time since the 1980s on Sunday by revealing that there are more registered Republicans than Democrats in the US.\n\nThis gives the Republican Party an edge in party identity and voter registration across the country and in swing states where polls show the race is too close to call.\n\nThe DailyMail.com poll in Pennsylvania released Sunday morning showed Harris and Trump each with 47 percent support in the state that will likely decide the election.\n\nThree other polls from ABC, CBS and NBC showed the vice president's lead over Trump narrowing in the past month.\n\nFollow all developments on our live blog about American politics.\n\nAmerica has more registered Republicans than Democrats which is a huge boost for Trump\n\nFor the first time since the time of Ronald Reagan, there are more registered Republicans than Democrats participating in elections in the run-up to elections.\n\nThe statistics are a big boost for Donald Trump and the Republicans who are trying to retake the Senate.\n\nIn 2020, Democrats had an eight-point lead in registered voters.\n\nIn 2016, when Trump did win, the Democrats had a three-point lead.\n\nThis time the Republicans are ahead by one point.\n\nIt was the first time they had such an advantage since 1984, when Reagan won in a landslide.\n\nBetting platform Kalshi gives Trump a 53% chance of winning the presidency, while Kamala Harri has 47%\n\nBetting platform Kalshi has updated its betting odds for the 2024 presidential elections.\n\nThe site, which bills itself as the \"only legal prediction market in the US,\" gives Donald Trump a 53 percent chance of winning, while Kamala Harris has a 47 percent chance.\n\nSign up for the Daily Mail's US politics newsletter for the 2024 presidential election\n\nThe 2024 presidential election could be one of the closest in history.\n\nPolls show former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are neck-and-neck in one of the most unprecedented campaigns in recent history.\n\nThe race was dominated by assassination attempts, two dramatic debates and President Joe Biden making the monumental decision to abandon a chance at a second term by dropping out of the race.\n\nEvery day there are dramatic twists that shape the biggest conversation in the country: Who will be the next president?\n\nAs the United States approaches Election Day on November 5, DailyMail.com is launching its first political newsletter to keep you informed of the most important developments.\n\nDonald Trump is getting the support of a major labor union as part of the plan to overhaul Biden's border policies\n\nDonald Trump promised to strengthen the beleaguered Border Patrol with thousands of new agents if he were elected to put an end to what he calls the importation of migrants by Biden and Harris.\n\nThe agency has recently faced employee retention and recruitment issues, in addition to low morale, as many field agents have been assigned processing duties amid the historic surge of approximately 10 million migrants we have experienced over the past 3.5 years .\n\nThe ex-president's policy proposal came at a rally before thousands Sunday at the Findlay Toyota Center in Prescott Valley, Arizona -- an hour and a half north of Phoenix, through winding passes that bisect red

elected to put an end to what he calls the importation of migrants by Biden and Harris.\n\nThe agency has recently faced employee retention and recruitment issues, in addition to low morale, as many

at a rally before thousands Sunday at the Findlay Toyota Center in Prescott Valley, Arizona -- an hour and a half north of Phoenix, through winding passes that bisect red pillar-like mountains.\n\nEnthusiastic border agents cheered enthusiastically when Trump brought up the Border Patrol and his past success in working with them: \"You know what I did, I called them up and said 'close the border,'\" he recalled before crediting himself for the low migration numbers.\n\nThen he promised that if he won on Election Day, \"The migrant invasion ends and our country's recovery begins.\"\n\nTo do that, Trump said he wanted to hire dozens of new Border Patrol agents.\n\nHarris plans to legalize recreational marijuana and create \"forgivable\" loans to get black men to vote\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has unveiled plans to legalize recreational marijuana and create \"forgivable\" business loans for Black entrepreneurs in an effort to win the Black vote.\n\nHarris' presidential campaign is under pressure to win more votes, especially from black men, with polls showing her lower status in the voting bloc than Joe Biden when he ran in 2020.\n\nWhile 85 percent of Black men said they would vote for Biden in 2020, 75 percent said they would vote for the current vice president.\n\nHer new plans, unveiled today, include providing forgivable business loans to Black entrepreneurs, creating more apprenticeships and studying sickle cell disease and other diseases that disproportionately affect African-American men.\n\nHarris has already said she supports the legalization of marijuana and her plan calls for ensuring black men have the opportunity to participate as a \"national cannabis industry takes shape.\"\n\nShe also calls for better regulation of cryptocurrency to protect Black men and others who invest in digital assets.\n\nTrump and Harris tied in Pennsylvania: Daily Mail poll finds dead heat in state likely to decide 2024 election\n\nIf it wasn't already clear, our latest poll from the crucial state of Pennsylvania explains in the starkest terms how the presidential election will go down to the wire.\n\nIt shows that Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are in a dead heat.\n\nIf the election were held tomorrow, they would all win 47 percent of the vote in a state that holds the keys to the White House, according to our latest poll from DailyMail.com/JL Partners.\n\nThe state is likely to be the turning point in the elections. The 19 electoral college votes could push one or the other candidate past the threshold for victory on November 5.\n\nOf all the seven major battlefields, this is the most consistent.\n\nKamala Harris would be in line to win Pennsylvania if she had chosen Governor Josh Shapiro of the battleground state as her running mate - but only just, according to the Daily Mail poll\n\nIn presidential elections that will be decided by the narrowest of margins, every decision counts.\n\nBut did Kamala Harris make a mistake in choosing her running mate?\n\nA new poll from DailyMail.com/JL Partners shows her tied with Donald Trump in the likely tipping point state of Pennsylvania.\n\nStill, she would be ahead if she had added Governor Josh Shapiro to her ticket instead of Tim Walz of Minnesota.\n\nWhen likely voters were asked who they would support, 47 percent said Harris/Shapiro, one point more than they would vote for Donald Trump and JD Vance.","image":"https://nybreaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Presidential-polls-live-updates-Trump-gets-another-boost-over-Harris.jpg","eventUri":"eng-9987329","sentiment":0.2706,"wgt":466607706,"relevance":12,"source_uri":"nybreaking.com","source_dataType":"news","source_title":"NY Breaking News"},{"uri":"2024-10-514485537","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2024-10-14","time":"13:04:17","dateTime":"2024-10-14T13:04:17Z","dateTimePub":"2024-10-14T13:03:59Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://moroccoworldnews.com/2024/10/365736/2024-u-s-presidential-election-a-difficult-choice-on-election-day-a-tougher-test-for-democracy-the-day-after","title":"2024 U.S. Presidential Election: A Difficult Choice on Election Day, a Tougher Test for Democracy the Day After","body":"As early voting has begun in several states in the United States, the Uncommitted National Movement (UNM) announced, on September 19th, in a press conference and a statement published on social media that it would not support Kamala Harris' campaign, the Democratic Party presidential candidate.\n\nThis position comes in the context of an election marked by significant uncertainties and polarization due to the U.S. administration's unconditional support for Israel's non-proportional war on Gaza, Palestine since October 7, 2023, on the one hand, and the presence of the former President Donald Trump--known for his authoritarian tendencies as well as populist and racist rhetoric--as the Republican Party presidential candidate nominee, on the other hand.\n\nThe UNM made this announcement after Harris failed to respond to its demands that call for:\n\nThe movement also stressed the importance of not voting for the Republican candidate Donald Trump due to his dangerous pro-war stance on Gaza. It also advised against voting for a third party, which could contribute to Trump's victory.\n\nThrough this statement, the movement also asserted its commitment to pressuring the U.S. administration to achieve its demands. This position presents a significant challenge to the Democratic Party and triggers many questions about its impact on the political landscape on Election Day and beyond, especially in the event of Trump's win.\n\nThe UNM was launched in February of this year by activists within the Democratic Party.\n\nThe movement initiated a protest campaign to urge the US administration to halt Israel's war on Gaza following the events of October 7, 2023.\n\nTo this end, and in preparation for the Democratic Party's presidential primaries, the movement organized, and in a very short period, an unexpectedly successful campaign in the state of Michigan.\n\nThe campaign mobilized voters to choose \"Uncommitted\" instead of \"Joe Biden\" on the ballot as a form of pressure to demonstrate to the Democratic Party the weight of votes calling for an end to the war on Gaza.\n\nFollowing this initial success, the movement led other campaigns that achieved remarkable results in states such as Wisconsin, Washington, Minnesota, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Mexico, Oregon, and Hawaii. As a result of this mobilization, the campaign garnered more than 700,000 votes nationwide and secured 37 delegates at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nThe importance of the campaign lies in the fact that in most of these states, the percentage of votes as \"Uncommitted\" exceeds the margin by which Trump won the 2020 election. Notably, the uncommitted votes were not limited to American Muslims and Arabs; the majority came from other ethnic and social groups within American society, particularly among whites, African Americans, and Latinos.\n\nThe position of the Uncommitted Movement represents a significant loss for the Democratic Party that can cost it the upcoming presidential election on November 5th. This is especially true given that the movement consists of a substantial \"voting bloc\" that many election experts believe could be decisive on election day, particularly in swing states since the race for the White House between the Republican and Democratic parties is extremely close. For example, Muslim voters within the movement are among the most politically engaged religious groups in the U.S. and they often vote based on key issues and not party affiliation. According to a poll and report published on September, 18 of this year by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU), in the 2020 election, Biden narrowly beat Trump (46% to 45%) in three swing states: Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Georgia. This suggests that the strong support Biden received from Muslim voters was crucial for his victory. The situation appears to be similarly tight in the current election as most ongoing polls in the U.S. indicate a close race between the Democratic and Republican campaigns. As a result, swing states are very likely expected to determine the outcome as both candidates have equal chances of winning. Although it is unlikely that these voters will shift their support to Trump. The same ISPU poll shows that the level of Muslim support for Trump is still about the same since 2016, particularly in swing states. Even in case these voters decide to abstain from voting or support a third party--as a protest vote--this could indirectly benefit Trump.\n\nFor instance, votes for Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, whose campaign has gained noticeable support, especially among Arab and Muslim American voters, could provide an advantage to Trump. Experts explain that in a closely contested two-party election, the presence of a third party often benefits one of the main candidates. This dynamic poses a serious challenge for the Democratic Party as it risks losing critical votes in key swing states.\n\nThe position of the current US administration on the war in Gaza certainly presents a difficult choice and challenge for many Democratic Party voters and supporters as well as undecided voters within the general electorate due to their dissatisfaction with both parties, especially among youth.\n\nAt the same time, many indicators also suggest that the period following the November 5th election will also be a difficult one as the U.S. democratic system and institutions will face greater challenges than those experienced during Trump's presidency between 2016 and 2020.\n\nIn this context, many political analysts-- such as Professor Jack Goldstone, an expert in social movements and revolutions who raised alarms in 2020 of the possibility of events similar to January 6, 2021, when Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol to stop the certification of the election results to prevent the inauguration of Joe Biden as new President--warn that there is a high likelihood that the U.S. could face significant chaos that can escalate to a civil war.\n\nAmong the significant indicators of such a possibility are: continued attempts to undermine the democratic process and state institutions, sharp polarization within American society, increasing level of political violence rhetoric, and weakening trust between citizens, state institutions, and political actors.\n\nContinued Attempts to Undermine the Democratic Process and Institutions are still key features of Trump's rhetoric. Trump has consistently reminded his supporters that \"We will win, and we won't lose the election; and if we do, it's because of a rigged system and because the Democrats will rig the elections just like they did in 2020 that I won.\" This narrative suggests that, in the event of a loss, Trump is willing to challenge the democratic outcome of the elections and undermine the rule of law, just as he attempted to do in 2021. Most importantly, many analysts point out that Trump seems to be more organized and ready to act with the backing of far-right groups.\n\nGiven Trump's authoritarian tendencies, many observers do not rule out the possibility of a coup attempt. While this may not involve military force, it could take other forms that obstruct the functioning of constitutional institutions and the enforcement of the law, throwing the country into chaos similar to what he did in 2021 when he incited the attack on the US Capitol. The concern is that if Trump fails to win the election, he and his supporters might engage in disruptive actions that would challenge the democratic norms, leading to widespread disorder and causing political instability in the U.S.\n\nIn the event of a Trump victory in the 2024 election, the situation may not be much different. Trump will feel more empowered to consolidate authoritarian power that would lead the country into further chaos by undermining democratic institutions and the rule of law. It won't be surprising if Trump issues hasty populist executive orders that erode the principles of diversity and inclusion in the country. For example, he may first target immigrants, just as he did in 2017 with the \"Muslim Ban.\" Similarly, he could issue an executive order to ban abortion. These would be symbolic acts to show his supporters that he is delivering on his campaign promises and urge them to continue supporting him in all his decisions.\n\nIn the next phase, Trump will continue to use the executive constitutional powers to undermine the institutions that uphold the democratic system in the U.S.\n\nHe is also expected to rely on the support of Republican lawmakers, especially if the party holds a majority in one or both chambers in Congress, taking into consideration that Trump currently has near-complete control over the Republican Party and a far-right faction that is loyal to him is driving the party's agenda in Congress.\n\nThis could lead to the enactment of disruptive laws and decisions that would cause widespread institutional dysfunction, possibly paralyzing key functions of the government. A similar scenario occurred during his previous term with the infamous \"Government Shutdown\" in 2018 which lasted 35 days due to a deadlock between Trump and Congress over the federal budget justifying it as a fight against the so-called \"deep state.\" As a result, more than 800,000 federal employees lost their paychecks, and government services were severely disrupted, both domestically and internationally. Trump's presidency is also expected to continue with his isolationist foreign policies.\n\nThis might include further withdrawals from international agreements and organizations similar to what he did in his first term when he withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement, the United Nations Human Rights Council, the World Health Organization, and The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). All acts would further weaken the U.S. leadership stance on the international stage and strain its relationships with its traditional allies.\n\nIn this respect, it is worth mentioning the so-called \"Project 2025,\" also known as the \"2025 Presidential Transition Project,\" a political initiative published by the conservative Heritage Foundation in 2023.\n\nIts goal is to promote conservative and right-wing policies aimed at reshaping the U.S. federal government and strengthening the executive power should Trump win the 2024 presidential election. Although Trump denies any direct knowledge or involvement with the project, its measures align with his rhetoric and promises.\n\nFurthermore, numerous reports and leaks suggest that several key figures associated with it are among Trump's strongest allies and supporters. Many political analysts believe that project has been prepared to be adopted by Trump on the first day of his presidency, should he win, as it outlines a comprehensive roadmap to dismantle what he refers to as the \"deep state.\"\n\nExperts also point out that the project has an authoritarian approach and is heavily based on \"loyalty\" that will erode the principle of nonpartisan governance and meritocracy. Project 2025 includes several dangerous measures, such as eliminating the Departments of Education and Homeland Security and placing the FBI directly under the presidential authority.\n\nAccording to the same project, thousands of government employees and qualified civil servants would be dismissed and replaced by a carefully selected group loyal to Trump and supportive of conservative policies.\n\nThere are also significant concerns that civil rights and freedoms could experience a major setback in the event of a second Trump presidency. It is very likely that he could make decisions affecting freedom of expression and the right to protest taking into consideration his stance on the media, racial justice, voting rights, etc ... taking into consideration that some of the U.S. Supreme Court members were his appointees during his first term. In his current campaign rallies, Trump does not hesitate to attack all his opponents and critics among individuals and institutions. It is also worth noting that the 2025 Project includes many measures that threaten rights and freedoms. Using his presidential authorities, analysts do not preclude the possibility that Trump could call for the intervention of the National Guard to suppress civil society activities, such as preventing protests and mass rallies that criticize his policies, like the historic national \"Women's March\" that took place on January 23, 2017, as the first large civil society protest in response to his general policies after his inauguration as the new president.\n\nSharp Polarization within American Society: American society has always experienced a degree of polarization, but it has intensified in the last two decades. This polarization is currently reflected by the tight race between the Democratic and Republican campaigns as polls indicate that each party has maintained its voter base since 2020.\n\nThe deadlock in Congress, where laws are rarely passed in a bi-partisan way also reflects this polarization as both parties persist to oppose each other, often for political calculations that frequently disregard the public interest. One example was in 2023 when we witnessed how the Republican Kevin McCarthy paid the price when he worked with the Democratic Party to pass the federal budget in Congress to avoid another catastrophic government shutdown. As a consequence, McCarthy was removed from his position as Speaker of the House by members of his party.\n\nIncreasing Level of Political Violence Rhetoric, especially promoted by Trump and his Republican supporters, has become evident through the spread of fake news and incitement against Democrats, immigrants, and any opponent. In its October 2023 issue, Time Magazine indicates that more than 33% of Republicans expressed that violence might be the solution to \"save\" the United States.\n\nAnother poll by The New York Times indicates that 450 federal judges received threats last year, a 150% increase compared to 2019; while members of Congress received 8,000 threats, a 50% increase compared to 2018. One example of this rhetoric is the false and dangerous racist claims that Trump made about Haitian immigrants during the presidential debate with Harris on September 10th of this year.\n\nIn other rallies, he also declared that he would deport all supporters of Palestine and those calling for #Ceasefire_in_Gaza, claiming that they support Hamas and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). Moreover, Trump continues to implicitly encourage political violence by repeatedly promising a presidential pardon for those involved in the attack on the U.S. Capitol in 2021. He also attacks and criticizes anyone who supports the Democratic campaign or opposes his campaign, including prominent figures from politics, art, and other fields. This rhetoric of violence is further fueled by Trump's attacks on and questioning of electoral governance institutions and the judiciary, particularly after all such entities affirmed that the 2020 election results were free from any violations that could undermine its credibility. It is also worth mentioning that many legal and political experts assert that both the Department of Justice and Congress made a grave mistake by not preventing Trump from running for office again, especially after it was demonstrated that he incited the 2021 U.S. Capitol attack. The absence of such a measure has allowed him to move forward as a presidential candidate and emboldened him to continue his populist and racist rhetoric, which incites violence and threatens social peace.\n\nWeakening Trust between Citizens, State Institutions, and Elected Officials: the widening gap between the rich and the poor in the United States over the past decades has significantly undermined trust in the government. Numerous studies have revealed that a large segment of the middle class has fallen behind and has felt abandoned by the state and is seeking change. This is due to public policies that favor the wealthy and fail to strengthen citizens' socio-economic rights in areas such as employment, healthcare, and education.\n\nThe issue of \"gun violence\" is a good example of this broken trust. Despite the tragic repetitive shooting incidents by ordinary citizens that threaten American lives more than anything else, and despite the large mobilization and calls organized by civil society groups like \"The March of Our Lives\" Movement, Congress remains unable to take any meaningful action to restrict guns access, largely because of the pressure of the gun manufacturing lobbies like the National Rifle Association.\n\nThe \"Occupy Wall Street\" Movement is another example that depicts citizens' outcry against the economic inequality, disparities, corporate greed, and use of money in politics as well as complete dissatisfaction with entities that are largely granted financial advantages by lawmakers but fail to deliver the promised prosperity to ordinary citizens.\n\nThis growing frustration has been skillfully exploited by Trump to gain support for his campaign, adopting the slogan \"Make America Great Again\" (MAGA). He promises voters that he will bring back investments and the jobs that were outsourced abroad and will impose high tariffs to achieve this goal. Trump further taps into this discontent by speaking about the \"deep state,\" claiming that his goal as President is to dismantle it because it has pursued policies that do not serve ordinary citizens. Thus, he calls on voters to support him so that he can restore their socio-economic rights. On the other hand, the Biden administration's stance regarding the war on Gaza, providing unconditional support to Israel with taxpayer money, has also deepened the lack of trust in state institutions and political actors, particularly among youth. The administration's actions in this regard are seen as a violation of international and U.S. law creating a moral crisis that is expected to cast a shadow over the upcoming presidential elections on November 5th and beyond.\n\nWith just a few weeks remaining before Election Day, the day after remains open to several possibilities and questions that are expected to impact the dynamics within the political landscape and most importantly the democratic process in the United States. As such will the war on Gaza have a direct impact on the presidential election results in general, and on the Democratic Party in particular making it an unprecedented event in recent U.S. electoral history as foreign policy issues are often a low priority for American voters? And how will the Democratic Party handle this new variable to regain the trust of the voters it would have lost?\n\nWill increased voter abstention, especially among the youth, create a surprise in this election, given that those demanding a Cease-Fire in Gaza, particularly as the conflict has expanded to Lebanon, are expected to stay away from the ballot boxes, along with the undecided who are not convinced by the political offers of either party and reject the idea of voting for the \"lesser evil\"? And how will this abstention impact the election outcome?\n\nWill a third-party vote create a surprise this time and lead to the rise of the Green Party as another political entity that could break the binary nature of the U.S. political system and present an alternative to voters who no longer find appeal in the political platforms of Democrats and Republicans?\n\nFurthermore, in the event of Trump's win, to what extent will the pillars of the democratic system and its institutions withstand his authoritarian tendencies and the rise of his far-right supporters? And will such a scenario serve as a serious wake-up call for political and civil society actors in the U.S. to engage in a constructive dialogue about a range of pressing issues, such as electoral campaign financing, racial justice; electoral system, particularly the Electoral College; and the role of money and lobbies in the electoral process as well as its influence on public policies?

The majority of the people in the affected communities in North Carolina and Florida voted for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in 2020, making some election analysts wonder if some Trump supporters will be able to cast their ballots.\n\nAmy Lieberman, a politics and society editor at The Conversation U.S., spoke with Boris Heersink, a scholar of voters' behavior after a natural disaster, to better understand if and how the recent hurricanes could shift the results of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nA massive hurricane disrupts people's lives in many important ways, including affecting people's personal safety and where they can live. Ahead of an election, there are a lot of practical limitations about how an election can be executed - like if a person can still receive mail-in ballots at home or elsewhere, or if it is possible to still vote in person at their polling location if that building was destroyed or damaged.\n\nAnother issue is whether people who have just lived through a natural disaster and will likely be dealing with the aftermath for weeks to come are focused on politics right now. Some might sit out the election because they simply have more important things to worry about.\n\nThe other side of the equation, which is what political scientists like myself are mostly focusing on, is whether people take the fact that a natural disaster happened into consideration when they vote.\n\nTwo scholars, Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels, have argued that sometimes voters are not great at figuring out how to incorporate bad things that happened to them into a voting position. In some cases, it is entirely fair to hold an elected official responsible for bad outcomes that affect people's lives. But at other moments, bad things can happen to us without that being the fault of an incumbent president or governor. And voters should ideally be able to balance out these different types of bad things - those it is fair to punish elected officials for, and those for which it isn't fair to hold them responsible.\n\nAfter all, a devastating hurricane is terrible, but it is not Kamala Harris' fault that it happened. But Achen and Bartels argue that voters frequently still punish elected officials for random bad events like this.\n\nTheir most famous example is the consequences of a series of shark attacks off the New Jersey coast in the summer of 1916. As a result of those attacks, the New Jersey tourism industry saw a major decline. While these findings are still being debated, Achen and Bartels argue that Jersey shore voters subsequently voted against Woodrow Wilson in the 1916 presidential election at a higher rate than they would have had the shark attacks not happened. They argue that voters did this even though Wilson had no involvement in the shark attacks.\n\nScholars like John Gasper and Andrew Reeves argue that voters mostly care whether elected officials respond appropriately to a disaster. So, if the president does a good job reacting, voters do not actually punish them at all in the next election. However, voters can punish elected officials if they feel like the response is not correct.\n\nThe fact that Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana in 2005 was not the fault of then-President George W. Bush. But the perceived slowness of the government response is something a voter could have held him responsible for.\n\nColleagues and I have shown that how people interpret the combination of a disaster and the government response is likely colored by their own partisanship.\n\nWe looked at both the effects of Superstorm Sandy on the 2012 presidential election and natural disasters' impact on elections more broadly from 1972 through 2004. One core finding is that when presidents reject state officials' disaster declaration requests, they lose votes in affected counties - but only if those counties were already more supportive of the opposite party.\n\nIf there is a strong positive government response, the incumbent president or their party can actually gain votes or lose voters affected by a disaster. So, Republicans affected by the hurricanes could become more inclined to vote against Harris if they feel like they are not getting the help they need. But it could also help Harris if affected Democrats feel like they are getting enough aid.\n\nThe major takeaway is that if the government responds really effectively to a natural disaster or other emergency, there is not a huge electoral penalty - and there could even be a small reward.\n\nThat is not irrelevant in a close election. If Republicans in affected areas in North Carolina feel the government response has been poor and it inspires them to turn out in higher numbers to punish Harris, that could matter. But if they feel like the response has been adequate, research suggests either no real effect on their support for Harris - or possibly even an increase in Harris voters.\n\nScholars mostly assume that people affected can tell whether the government response was good or not. Trump and other Republicans are falsely saying that the response is slow and falsely claiming that Federal Emergency Management Agency money is being spent on immigrants who are not living in the country legally. There does not appear to be a slow government response to the hurricane in North Carolina, and there's no evidence the response is insufficient in Florida, either.\n\nSo, the question now is whether voters affected by these hurricanes will respond based on their actual lived experiences, or how they are told they are living their experience.\n\nBoris Heersink receives funding from the Russell Sage Foundation.","eventUri":"eng-9992438","sentiment":0.0902,"wgt":466606141,"relevance":1,"source_uri":"foreignaffairs.co.nz","source_dataType":"news","source_title":"foreignaffairs.co.nz","author_uri":"mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz","author_name":"Mil-Osi Publisher","author_type":"author","author_isAgency":false},{"uri":"8362974388","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2024-10-14","time":"12:47:40","dateTime":"2024-10-14T12:47:40Z","dateTimePub":"2024-10-14T12:47:25Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.theringer.com/2024/10/14/24269797/my-mom-on-why-she-is-undecided-in-north-carolina","title":"My Mom on Why She's Undecided in North Carolina","body":"Tara is joined by her mom, Yolanda Palmeri, to discuss why she's still deciding who to vote for in the 2024 presidential election.
