    "title": "FBI 'Quietly Revises' Violent Crime Stats",
    "content": "Last year, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) initially issued its \"final\" nationwide crime data for 2022, the bureau reported that the country's violent crime rate decreased by 2.1 percent. Democrats quickly latched onto this purported percent change to counter Donald Trump's claims that crime is soaring under the Biden-Harris administration.However, a year later, the FBI has \"quietly revised\" those numbers, according to a RealClearInvestigations report by crime watchdog Dr. John Lott, correcting the dataset to show that violent crime actually increased in 2022 by 4.5 percent. This means the FBI was way off -- by 6.6 percentage points. These additions include thousands more murders, rapes, robberies, and aggravated assaults, Lott says.The federal law enforcement made no mention of this \"stealth edit\" in its September 2024 press release.Lott, who served as senior adviser for research and statistics in the Office of Justice Programs and the Office of Legal Policy at the U.S. Justice Department, discovered this correction through \"a cryptic reference\" on the FBI website stating: \"The 2022 violent crime rate has been updated for inclusion in CIUS, 2023.\" The vague editor's note did not disclose that those figures increased. Lott says the change can only be seen by downloading the FBI's newly edited crime data and comparing it to the initial file released in 2023.According to Lott's analysis, the revisions are \"extensive.\" There were 80,029 more violent crimes than in 2021, including an additional 1,699 murders, 7,780 rapes, 33,459 robberies, and 37,091 aggravated assaults. How did the FBI originally miss so many murders, given that the vast majority of them are reported to authorities?\"The question naturally arises: should the FBI's 2023 numbers be believed?\" Lott also asks, as the FBI's initial underreporting casts doubt on the reliability of its data past and present. Data hawks are also wondering whether the federal agency is fudging the numbers and raising concerns of data manipulation in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election.It's been more than three weeks since the FBI released the revised 2022 data, and it has yet to make a public announcement explaining the discrepancy. \"The Bureau's lack of acknowledgment or explanation about the significant change concerns researchers,\" Lott observes.\"This FBI report is stunning because it now doesn't state that violent crime in 2022 was much higher than it had previously reported, nor does it explain why the new rate is so much higher, and it issued no press release about this large revision,\" David Mustard, a professor at the University of Georgia who extensively researches crime, told Lott. \"This lack of transparency harms the FBI's credibility.\"\"I have checked the data on total violent crime from 2004 to 2022,\" Carl Moody, a professor at the College of William & Mary who specializes in studying crime, commented. \"There were no revisions from 2004 to 2015, and from 2016 to 2020, there were small changes of less than one percentage point. The huge changes in 2021 and 2022, especially without an explanation, make it difficult to trust the FBI data.\"\"It is up to the FBI to explain what they have done, and they haven't explained these large changes,\" Dr. Thomas Marvell, president of Justec Research, a criminal justice statistical research organization, remarked.The FBI did not respond to Lott's repeated requests for comment.Lott notes that the FBI's revisions reveal how much guesswork is truly involved.As Townhall previously covered, the FBI's calculations are not based on simply counting crimes. Instead, it offers estimates by extrapolating data from police departments that report only partial-year data. This includes estimations for cities that fail to report any data to the federal government. According to reporting rates monitored by the Marshall Project, nearly one-third of local law enforcement agencies (31 percent of the 18,000) were MIA from the FBI's 2022 crime statistics.According to how the U.S. Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics describes the estimation model:\"It is the statistical process which allows inferences to be made about an outcome of interest in a population (e.g., the number of murders in the United States), even if information about the outcome is only known for part of the population  Not all law enforcement agencies submit all their crime data; some provide only partial data, or no data at all, on crimes and arrests.\"In other words, the FBI figures are \"a guess - albeit an informed guess - built on assumptions to fill in data that is often otherwise known (i.e., the number of homicides in Los Angeles in 2021 - 402),\" says the Coalition for Law, Order, and Safety (CLOS), a public safety group comprised of law enforcement officials and analysts. Because the Los Angeles Police Department did not submit data, the FBI inferred what the number would likely have been, despite the data being publicly available.The FBI's process for estimating unreported figures has \"long been a black box,\" Jeffrey Anderson, who served as director of the Bureau of Justice Statistics from 2017 to 2021, wrote for City Journal.Anderson said that when he headed the Bureau of Justice Statistics, \"We definitely would have highlighted in a press release or a report the 6.6% change recorded for 2022, which moved the numbers from a drop to a rise in violent crime.\"Another issue with the FBI crime data is its reliance on reported crimes, Lott notes. Many crimes go unreported; only about 45 percent of violent victimizations and 30 percent of property crimes were brought to the police's attention in 2023, according to the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS).Since the FBI only tracks reported incidents, researchers caution that when the media pounce on preliminary crime rates generated by FBI data, they should clarify that it reflects \"reported\" crime but does not accurately capture America's crime crisis.Meanwhile, other measurements show sharper rises in crime.",

    "title": "Is swing state business in better shape than it was four years ago? Here's what the data says",
    "content": "Five of the seven swing states in the 2024 presidential election improved their overall business climates during the Biden-Harris administration, according to CNBC's annual America's Top States for Business study. But that does not necessarily mean the states are better off economically, in an election cycle where the economy has consistently ranked at or near the top of voters' concerns.Since 2007, CNBC has been ranking all 50 states across ten categories of competitiveness to determine the best overall states in which to do business. Behind the rankings are dozens of metrics that offer a detailed picture of each state's business and economic climate.We compared the most recent rankings, published in July, with those from 2019 -- the last full year of data before the Covid-19 pandemic, and in many ways the peak of the Trump economy. Of the seven biggest battlegrounds in terms of polling and Electoral College heft, only Nevada and Wisconsin saw their overall rankings decline.The other 5 swing states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania -- all improved their standing.Of course, competitiveness is complicated. It often has every bit as much, or more, to do with state policies than what is happening in Washington. Still, there are plenty of statistics for both the Trump and Harris campaigns to either claim credit for, or to run away from.Here is how the business climates break down in the battlegrounds.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. first announced in 2020 that it would make its U.S. home in Arizona with a $12 billion investment -- a big win for the Trump administration.But Arizona's semiconductor industry, which dates back to Motorola in the 1950s, really took off with the CHIPS and Science Act, signed into law by President Biden in 2022.Spurred by $6.6 billion in CHIPS Act funding, TSMC has raised its Arizona investment to $65 billion, including three giant chip fabrication plants. Intel is investing $30 billion. And Arizona now ranks third behind California and Texas for semiconductor manufacturing and related facilities, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.The state has the infrastructure to handle all this development, including one of the nation's most reliable power grids. But it is struggling in other areas, like the rising cost of living.Arizona's Workforce ranking falls to No. 6, as state workforce training programs try to keep up with demand. And the state ranks No. 47 for education, with large class sizes and underfunded schools. Last year, TSMC announced it was delaying until 2025 the start of production in Arizona -- which had been scheduled for this year -- due to a labor shortage.The Biden administration designated Phoenix as a Workforce Hub under another CHIPS and Science Act program designed to encourage public-private partnerships, and to nourish Arizona's relatively dry talent pipeline.Georgia's top ranked Infrastructure puts The Peach State at the heart of any company's location search. The state has always been a powerhouse in that area, starting with the world's busiest airport -- Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International. The airport is getting a $45 million facelift under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.But much of Georgia's infrastructure prowess is homegrown, including the state's well-regarded site readiness program, Georgia Ready for Accelerated Development (GRAD), which currently offers 60 shovel-ready sites. That has helped the state become a center for electric vehicle production, with Kia, Hyundai and Rivian all locating facilities there. The Georgia Department of Economic Development boasts more than $27 billion in EV investments since 2018.The Inflation Reduction Act, for which Vice President Kamala Harris cast the deciding vote in 2022, aims to boost the EV industry with new and extended tax credits. But Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, has claimed that the IRA has done the opposite by pushing the industry too fast and fanning a backlash against the technology.Georgia ranks 40th for Quality of Life due to poor health care, weak worker protections, and a six-week abortion ban, which the Georgia Supreme Court reinstated this month.Michigan burst into the top ten in 2023, moving up to ninth place this year, following years of mediocrity.The Wolverine State is a supremely affordable place to live, with the nation's third lowest Cost of Living. Michigan's Cost of Doing Business ranking is solid too, thanks in large part to generous incentives. And the state has improved its Business Friendliness ranking by cutting regulations.All of this has made Gov. Gretchen Whitmer a rising Democratic star, and a busy surrogate for the Harris campaign. In 2022, Michigan Democrats achieved their first trifecta in state government in 40 years, winning control of both houses of the state legislature in addition to the governorship. The new majority promptly repealed Michigan's right to work law, approved new protections against discrimination and enshrined abortion rights.Whitmer promised that those changes would help attract workers to the state, but it has not worked out that way yet. Michigan lags the nation in attracting workers, according to Top States data.Economic growth was sluggish last year, though there have been signs of an upturn to start 2024. The slowdown in the electric vehicle industry forced Ford Motor to scale back its plans for a $3.5 billion battery plant in Michigan. The state, in turn, scaled back the $1.7 billion in incentives it was prepared to pay, revising the package to $409 million.Nevada's highest in the nation unemployment rate -- 5.5% as of August -- is nothing to brag about. And it can't help the mood of the voters as Election Day approaches. But for employers, it means The Silver State has a wealth of available talent. It is one of the reason's Nevada's Workforce ranking has surged into the top ten in 2024.Nevada is also attracting workers to move there, ranking No. 8 in this year's Lightcast Talent Attraction Index, developed exclusively for CNBC. Economic growth has slowed in 2024 but it was solid last year, helping to Nevada's Economy improve to No. 8.But Nevada's overall competitiveness has suffered during the Biden-Harris years. The state's Education system is now America's worst. At 24 students per teacher, Nevada's class sizes are the largest in the nation, according to National Education Association data. Support for higher education is meager, and there is just one public community college. K-12 test scores rank 47th in the nation.Nevada ranks No. 46 for Technology and Innovation, with relatively little presence in key emerging industries like semiconductors and artificial intelligence. The state did win a coveted Tech Hub last year under the CHIPS and Science Act, developing the next generation of lithium-ion batteries.The Tar Heel State has always been competitive, a Top States contender nearly every year -- no matter who was in the White House -- since CNBC began ranking the states in 2007. This year, North Carolina came tantalizingly close to a first-ever Top States three-peat. After notching back-to-back first place finishes in 2022 and 2023, the state slipped to second place behind Virginia in 2024 by a mere three points.While North Carolina still has America's third-best Workforce, the fourth-best Economy, and comes in second behind North Dakota for Business Friendliness, the state fell to No. 20 for Infrastructure as its electric and water utilities struggled to keep up with growth.That growth has also hurt North Carolina's Cost of Living and Cost of Doing Business rankings, and more trouble could be on the way. While the state had managed to weather the insurance crisis ravaging much of the nation this year, Hurricane Helene could change that. North Carolina was among the hardest hit by the monster storm, which caused devastating floods in western parts of the state not normally associated with hurricane damage.Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro, who took office last year and made it onto the short list for Vice President Harris' running mate in 2024, has made education -- and school funding in particular -- a central issue.\"We're facing real challenges in education and with our workforce that will hold us back in the future if we don't take action right now,\" Shapiro said in his annual budget address in February.The state has made some important strides. It now ranks third in Education, behind Virginia and Massachusetts. The state ranks ninth for higher education funding, a Shapiro priority, up from No. 34 in 2019, according to the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association.Pennsylvania is also a relatively affordable place to live. And the fact that 144 million people live within a day's drive improves the state's otherwise mediocre Infrastructure ranking.But Pennsylvania's Economy is lackluster -- ranking No. 34. Job growth is poor, and the state finishes dead last for new business formations. It probably does not help that Pennsylvania is America's twelfth-most regulated state, according to the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.Pennsylvania lags the nation in migration of college educated workers to the state, and it has just 18 community colleges in a state with 13 million people. Both statistics hurt the state's Workforce ranking.The promise by President Trump in 2018 that \"the eighth wonder of the world\" was coming to southeastern Wisconsin turned into a major embarrassment for Trump and then-Gov. Scott Walker when Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn largely abandoned its plans to build a massive facility near Racine.Walker, a Republican, promised Foxconn more than $3 billion in state and local subsidies. The failure of the deal, which was already apparent by November of 2018, may have helped cost him his re-election.His Democratic successor, Gov. Tony Evers, renegotiated the Foxconn deal. Today, Microsoft is building data centers on the site, with a fraction of the jobs that Foxconn promised. Separately, the state won a coveted Tech Hub designation under the CHIPS and Science Act, along with a $49 million grant to develop its burgeoning bio-health sector.Despite all of that, Wisconsin's overall competitiveness ranking declined this year, largely due to a big drop in its Education ranking, dropping to No. 26 from No. 9 in 2019. Evers, a former state school superintendent, has been unable to head off a big decline in state support for higher education. Wisconsin finished No. 41 in that metric this year, compared to No. 4 in 2019.",

    "title": "More Than 30M Christians Could Sit Out 2024 Presidential Election, Study Reveals",
    "content": "Upwards of 104 million people of faith -- including some 32 million self-identified Christians who regularly attend church services -- are expected to sit out of the 2024 presidential election.They are likely to hold back from the Nov. 5 contest due to a lack of interest, according to new data from Arizona Christian University's Cultural Research Center, operated by evangelical pollster George Barna.Voter enthusiasm, the study found, decreased significantly from 2020 to 2024.\"The research asked people who indicated they were not likely to vote to explain the reasons for that choice,\" wrote the researchers. \"The most common reason, offered by two-thirds of the non-voters (68%), was a lack of interest in politics and elections.\"More than half of survey respondents -- 57% -- said they dislike both leading candidates, Vice President Kamala Harris and President Donald Trump. And 55% said they don't feel either candidate reflects their values.Researchers reportedly believe that, if the survey's findings prove true on Election Day, Trump's re-election is less likely and Harris could more easily pull off a victory.Barna is encouraging pastors and ministry leaders to use their positions to urge churchgoers to practice their civic duty by casting their ballots on Nov. 5.\"Pastors often seek opportunities to have a positive influence in people's lives and upon the culture, and to help the community in which their church is located,\" he said. \"This research underscores the fact that simply encouraging people to vote in order to fulfill their biblical responsibility would not only be seen as doing their job while helping the community, but an estimated five million regular churchgoers would be likely to vote as a result of that simple exhortation.\"Last month, Dr. Jeff Myers, an author, speaker, and president of Summit Ministries, appeared on CBN's \"Faith vs. Culture,\" where he addressed the question: \"Should Christians avoid politics?\"When stepping into the ballot box, Myers urged Bible-believers to consider \"constitutional principles\" like \"life, liberty,  property,\" because those \"are the three things the Constitution said it's developed in order to provide.\"He explained, \"How do I support life with my vote? How about liberty -- things like religious liberty and free speech? What about property? Who's going to be most likely to think that people ought to have their own property and own businesses? Because there are a lot of worldviews out there, let's be honest, who say the abolition of private property would be a preferable state. So which candidate for any given office is going to be most likely to lessen the evils that occur around life, liberty, and property? ... That is going to help inform my decision.\"While there is plenty in the election cycle that can be discouraging, Myers argued the Bible calls Christians to participate in the process, noting that, in a constitutional republic like the U.S., the people are responsible for forming and holding to account their government.\"Who are the governing authorities?\" Myers asked rhetorically. \"The people. So, in this situation -- in the American context -- if you are a Christian and you are not involved, you are literally disobeying God's admonition to be obedient to the governing authorities.\"",

    "title": "Call to Action: Armed Self-Defense is the Key to Preserving All American Freedoms",
    "content": "OpinionEditors Note: This is a condensed version of Arbalest Quarrel's longer article \"NRA's Doug Hamlin Is Right: Armed Self-Defense Extends To All Other Rights,\" which you can read here.On May 20, 2024, Doug Hamlin was elected as the NRA's new Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President. His election comes at a critical time for the NRA and gun owners across America, as the stakes for the upcoming 2024 presidential election could not be higher. In his first message to NRA members, published in the July 2024 issue of America's 1st Freedom, Hamlin delivered a powerful message:\"We are resolute. We know our mission. We are all in this together . . . There has never been a more important time for us to get back on our feet than right now. The American people want their freedom. No, they demand their freedom. And now the NRA has righted its course . . . Now is the time to come together. Now is the time to be bold.\"Hamlin's words were more than just a call for unity. They were a call for action. He emphasized that the future of American freedom, and specifically the Second Amendment, depends on what gun owners do in the coming months. His message -- \"Now is the time to be bold\" -- resonated deeply with those who understand that armed self-defense is the cornerstone of preserving all other rights.In the October 2024 issue of America's 1st Freedom, Hamlin expanded on his concerns about the upcoming presidential election, making it clear that the stakes could not be higher. His remarks echoed those of countless other Second Amendment advocates who have long warned that the right to keep and bear arms is under attack like never before.Hamlin's address struck a particular chord with Stephen L. D'Andrilli, Co-Founder of The Arbalest Quarrel, who voiced his agreement in the magazine's \"Mail Call\" section. D'Andrilli echoed Hamlin's urgency, stating that if gun owners do not heed this call to action, \"all is lost, forever.\"He and his business partners at The Arbalest Quarrel recognize that the liberties hard-fought and won in 1776 have been under assault ever since, and the battle has only intensified in recent years. The forces behind the Biden-Harris administration, D'Andrilli warns, have come dangerously close to achieving their goal: transforming the U.S. into a Marxist dictatorship, ultimately merging it into a global Marxist empire.Had Donald Trump won the 2020 election, this Marxist trajectory would have been halted. But the 2020 election, fraught with unethical tactics and outright illegal strategies employed by the Democrat Party, ensured a victory for Joe Biden. Many gun owners made the fatal mistake of sitting out that election, and Hamlin and D'Andrilli agree that this must not happen again.\"We need to vote and make sure all gun owners vote,\" Hamlin said. \"If we do, we will retain our freedom.\" His message is clear: the upcoming election in November is the last chance for gun owners to turn the country around.In his July address, Hamlin described the Second Amendment as a \"keystone\" to American freedom. Without the right to armed self-defense, he warned, none of the other rights enshrined in the Constitution are secure. The Second Amendment allows Americans to defend their lives, their property, and their freedoms. Without it, every other right is in jeopardy.Hamlin's assertion strikes at the heart of the gun rights debate. While some may argue that other rights, like freedom of speech, take precedence, Hamlin rightly points out that the Second Amendment is what guarantees that those rights can be defended. Without the ability to physically defend oneself, freedom of speech and all other rights are hollow.This perspective directly challenges those who downplay the importance of the Second Amendment. Even within the NRA, voices like John C. Sigler, a Board Member, have argued that the First Amendment holds more significance. In an October 7 article in AmmoLand Shooting Sports News, Sigler claimed that the First Amendment is the bedrock upon which individual freedom is built since it makes democracy possible.However, D'Andrilli and his partners partially disagree with Sigler's assessment. While freedom of speech is crucial, it is the Second Amendment that protects all other freedoms. As D'Andrilli succinctly puts it, \"No, Mr. Sigler! You are wrong!\"The First Amendment is vital, but it does not stand alone. The right to dissent, to express one's thoughts freely, and to challenge government authority is ultimately safeguarded by the armed citizenry. Without the Second Amendment, the First Amendment and all other rights can be easily eroded by a tyrannical government. The Second Amendment is what ensures the balance of power between the people and the state.As we approach the November 2024 presidential election, the stakes could not be higher. Hamlin's message is clear: if gun owners do not turn out to vote for Donald Trump, the country will face a future in which freedom and liberty are extinguished. The forces working behind the scenes to support Kamala Harris are pushing a Marxist agenda that will destroy America's Constitutional Republic.D'Andrilli echoes Hamlin's warning, stressing that this election is the last opportunity to preserve the Republic. \"Rarely does a person get a second chance to undo a past horrible mistake,\" he says. \"We, Americans, do have that chance now.\"If Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, win the White House, the Marxist takeover of America will be complete. The Constitution will be rewritten, the Bill of Rights will be eviscerated, and the free Republic will collapse into despotism and tyranny. Gun confiscation will be at the top of their agenda, and millions of Americans who cherish their right to bear arms will find themselves disarmed and defenseless.However, there is still time to avert this disaster. As D'Andrilli points out, there are millions of gun owners across the country who have not yet registered to vote. If these gun owners register and vote in November, they can turn the tide of the election and ensure that Donald Trump returns to the White House.The battle for America's soul comes down to two opposing visions: one that embraces individualism, freedom, and the principles of the American Revolution and another that seeks to impose collectivism, control, and Marxism. Only one of these visions can prevail, and the outcome will determine the fate of the nation for generations to come.Hamlin understands this reality all too well. His call to action is both a plea and a warning. If gun owners fail to vote in 2024, the consequences will be dire. There will be no third chance to reclaim the White House in 2028. The future of America hangs in the balance, and it is up to the armed citizenry to protect it.As Hamlin states, \"Your freedom is unequivocally on the ballot.\"The NRA's mission has always been to protect and defend the Constitution, especially the Second Amendment. Since its founding in 1871, the organization has been the oldest civil rights organization in the United States, dedicated to ensuring that Americans retain their right to bear arms. Hamlin seeks to revitalize this mission and remind gun owners that their votes are crucial in preserving the Republic.Throughout history, it has been the armed citizenry that has stood as the ultimate check on government power. From the American Revolution to the present day, the right to armed self-defense has ensured that the people remain sovereign over their government.In contrast, collectivist regimes -- like the one being pushed by the Harris/Walz ticket -- have always sought to disarm the population, knowing that an armed citizenry is the greatest threat to their control. If gun owners fail to vote in 2024, they risk losing not only their firearms but also their freedom.As D'Andrilli and Hamlin emphasize, the Second Amendment is not just about protecting other rights. It is an expression of freedom itself. The armed citizen is the embodiment of liberty, a living testament to the power of the individual to resist tyranny. Without this right, all other rights are vulnerable to government overreach.Hamlin's leadership comes at a critical time for the NRA and the nation as a whole. His bold vision for the future of the organization and his unwavering commitment to defending the Second Amendment offer hope to millions of Americans who cherish their right to self-defense.But this hope can only be realized if gun owners take action. The 2024 election is the last chance to turn the country away from the path of tyranny and toward a future of freedom and liberty. As Hamlin and D'Andrilli have made clear, the time for boldness is now.Gun owners must vote or risk losing everything!In the coming days, the future of America will be decided. Will we continue down the path of collectivism and tyranny, or will we reclaim the Republic and restore our freedoms? The answer lies in the hands of gun owners across the country.Doug Hamlin's call to action is clear: vote and ensure that Donald Trump returns to the White House. Failure to do so will lead to the destruction of the Republic, the loss of the Constitution, and the end of the Second Amendment.Gun owners must rise to the challenge, register to vote, and cast their ballots in November. The future of America depends on it.About The Arbalest Quarrel:Arbalest Group created 'The Arbalest Quarrel' website for a special purpose.

    "title": "Andres Reiljan on affective polarisation: Causes, impacts and solutions",
    "content": "What is affective polarisation, and what causes it?Affective polarisation refers to the mutual dislike between different societal groups. This phenomenon is predominantly studied in a political context: For example, in the United States, many individuals express positive feelings towards the Democratic Party while disliking the Republican Party, and vice versa. In the UK, a similar divide exists between Brexiteers and Remainers, and there are many other examples worldwide. Essentially, affective polarisation is about people's feelings, and an affectively polarised society is divided into mutually hostile political groups.The causes of affective polarisation are debated, but two central approaches have emerged. The first emphasises the role of identities: individuals who strongly identify with their political party may develop a \"tribal\" instinct and - as Lilliana Mason puts it - behave like sports fans rooting for their \"home team\", leading to hostility towards the opposing \"team\". This dynamic is strengthened when social and political identities align; for example, ethnic and sexual minorities in the US predominantly favour Democrats, while white evangelicals support Republicans. The second theory perceives policy disagreements as the central driver of affective polarisation: people dislike opposing parties because they perceive their positions on critical issues (e.g. abortion rights) as wrong or harmful. This approach underlines the rational roots of affective polarisation. Empirical evidence supports both theories to some extent, and in reality, affective polarisation is likely triggered by a combination of rational and tribal elements.Media and political elites play a significant role in either exacerbating or mitigating both mechanisms of affective polarisation. While they could promote consensus, they often choose to intensify conflict for financial or political gain, further deepening societal divisions.Could you give us examples of the intrusion of party cues in everyday life? In an earlier conversation, you linked stereotyping with affective polarisation. Could you provide more insight into your research on this issue and share some of your key findings?There is, indeed, clear evidence that individuals perceive their fellow citizens through a prejudiced lens based on political preferences. For instance, voters systematically assume that supporters of opposing parties are more selfish and less intelligent.A well-known set of indicators of affective polarisation's intrusion into daily life is social distance -- the extent to which people accept supporters of disliked parties within their social circles. In the US, nearly half of Democrats and Republicans express dissatisfaction if their child were to marry a supporter of the opposing party. Recent research by myself and several other scholars indicates that similar tendencies also exist in European countries, and in some cases, people may even want to avoid being coworkers or neighbours with someone who supports a disliked party.These findings stem from public opinion surveys, raising the question of whether such attitudes also translate into actual behaviour. Evidence suggests they do: for example, discrimination based on political affiliation can occur in the job market. A good (or actually sad) example of how affective polarisation leads to real-life consequences is a story of a pro-Trump tow truck driver who left a disabled woman stranded on the highway simply because he noticed a Bernie Sanders sticker on her bumper.In summary, an affectively polarised political environment can lead to a society where members of antagonistic political camps are unwilling to date, befriend, engage in civic or economic cooperation, or even live near one another.How harmful can affective polarisation be for democracy? Can we find a \"treatment\" in a scalable and stable way?Evidence shows that higher levels of affective polarisation are associated with democratic backsliding globally. Why? If people loathe the opposing party or parties, they view them not merely as rivals, but as enemies. This mindset can lead voters to accept democratic norm violations by their own party if it helps them defeat their adversaries.However, some studies argue that the dangers posed by affective polarisation may be overstated. Others suggest that it can even increase electoral turnout. A recent study found that both very low and very high levels of affective polarisation are linked to diminished support for democratic norms, while moderately polarised feelings can enhance democratic attitudes. Thus, there might be a \"sweet spot\" where citizens are polarised enough to care about election outcomes, but not so polarised that they perceive opponents as enemies that need to be destroyed.Addressing excessive affective polarisation is possible through interventions like priming common identities, encouraging cross-partisan dialogue, and correcting misconceptions about out-groups. However, the challenge lies in implementing these strategies on a larger scale. I believe the education system is key. Incorporating the topic of polarisation into civic education classes can help individuals learn to appreciate different views and disagree respectfully with one another.Voting advice applications could serve as valuable tools in this educational framework. Our preliminary research using data from the EU&I project for the 2024 European elections suggests that informing individuals about the actual positions of various parties can reduce dislike towards political opponents.In your recent paper, 'Patterns of Affective Polarization Toward Parties and Leaders Across the Democratic World,' which won the Best CSES Scholarship award, you explore how affective polarisation manifests in different political contexts. Could you elaborate on how the findings from that study might help us better understand the current political and public debate, particularly in light to the upcoming US elections? What similarities and differences do you observe between affective polarisation in the US and Europe, based on your research?This paper provides a broad cross-national comparison and helps us better understand the structural and institutional foundations of affective polarisation across 40 countries. Comparing the US with Europe, a key difference is that Americans exhibit more polarised feelings towards leading candidates than towards their parties, whereas, in Europe, parties as organisations are more polarising than their leaders. This is largely due to the US's presidential two-party system, which largely reduces the electoral competition to just two main candidates.Although affective polarisation in the US began before Donald Trump entered the political arena in 2015, he has intensified the existing hostility. Data also confirms his polarising appeal: after the 2020 election, for instance, Democrats disliked Trump more than the Republican Party itself, while Republicans viewed Biden slightly less negatively than the Democratic Party.Looking ahead to the 2024 presidential election, much depends on Trump. Will he win or lose, and how will he and his followers behave if he loses? If he does lose and exit the political arena, it may allow for a less controversial Republican leader to emerge, potentially reducing affective polarisation. However, the current race is very close and there are many reasons to be concerned about the upcoming US election. Given the high levels of affective polarisation, accepting the loss will be very difficult for either side.",

    "title": "'Weird' and 'Surreal': How Media Outlets Covered Trump's Musical Town Hall",
    "content": "This article is part of Media Bubbles, a regular feature that looks at how different news and opinion outlets -- large, small and often partisan -- are covering the 2024 presidential election.For about 30 minutes on Monday night, former President Donald J. Trump held an impromptu musical town hall outside of Philadelphia, standing onstage and swaying to songs like \"Time To Say Goodbye\" by Sarah Brightman and Andrea Bocelli, and \"Hallelujah\" by Rufus Wainwright.Both liberal and conservative media outlets described Mr. Trump's sudden broadcast of his campaign playlist as awkward -- but through far different lenses.Mr. Trump had been answering questions from a crowd of a few hundred people with Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota at the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center in Oaks, Pa. But after multiple medical emergencies in the crowd paused the question-and-answer portion of the event, Mr. Trump said: \"Let's not do any more questions. Let's just listen to music.\"Liberal outlets described the event using words like \"weird\" and \"disastrous.\" They said that the event was evidence of cognitive decline in Mr. Trump, and that he wasn't listening to the concerns of voters. Mr. Trump and his campaign have said he does not suffer from any cognitive impairment.Conservative outlets paid far less attention to the event, though those that covered it acknowledged that the scene was bizarre. Most also emphasized that the medical emergencies in the audience had caused the detour. Some accused Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris, of unfairly mocking Mr. Trump for his choice to play music and his movements onstage.Here's how a selection of outlets on the left and the right covered the news:FROM THE LEFTThe New RepublicThe New Republic, a liberal site, described the incident in one article as a \"weird musical detour.\" In that article, Hafiz Rashid, a writer for the site, said Mr. Trump's choices on Monday were part of a larger pattern of cognitive issues. He pointed to recent events in which Mr. Trump had stumbled over his words.\"It's the latest, and strangest, example of Trump showing clear signs of mental decline, even as he insists otherwise,\" Mr. Rashid wrote.Mr. Trump has dismissed concerns about his cognitive capability and insisted that he has passed cognitive tests. Steven Cheung, Mr. Trump's campaign communications director, rejected the notion that Mr. Trump had cognitive issues in a statement, saying he \"does multiple public events every single day and the public can see he is sharper and more focused than ever before.\"In a separate article, Parker Molloy, a contributor to The New Republic, wrote that the event \"wasn't a charming detour or a moment of levity; it was a bewildering departure from the friendly campaign event.\"\"With the election just weeks away, one would expect a candidate to seize every opportunity to address voters' concerns,\" Ms. Molloy wrote. \"Instead, Trump chose to play D.J., leaving many in the crowd puzzled.\"FROM THE LEFTHuffPostHuffPost, a liberal news site, ran several headlines in all-caps that seemed to make light of the town hall. One all-caps headline said: \"What. Was. That. Joker Twists Town Hall Into Musical.\" Another said, \"Don Gets Weird: 40-minute Musical.\"Igor Bobic, a senior reporter for HuffPost who covers Congress, the White House and political campaigns, wrote in a news article that Mr. Trump had been taking questions from the audience on the issues like housing affordability, but that he \"seemed to grow bored with the format after two people fainted in the audience.\"In another article, Ed Mazza, an overnight editor at HuffPost, wrote in a news article that the event came \"amid a new focus on his health and cognition due to speeches marked by slurred words, confusion over names and location, and lengthy, rambling digressions.\"FROM THE RIGHTThe Washington ExaminerThe Washington Examiner, a right-leaning site, ran an article with the headline, \"Trump town hall takes a turn for the surreal.\"Annabella Rosciglione, a breaking news reporter for the publication, described the town hall in vivid detail, offering a chronological exposition of the evening's events.She quoted Mr. Trump calling for the event organizers to play \"Ave Maria\" while medical professionals attended to one of the sick attendees, and noted that the song played two more times that night.She referred to the event as a \"music show,\" and said Mr. Trump played nine songs, which ranged in genre from opera to disco.\"During the musical portion, Trump performed some of his signature dance moves and sometimes pointed to audience members, but he mainly swayed onstage,\" she wrote.Ms. Rosciglione also reported that, \"on his way out of the event, Trump spoke to attendees to the tune of 'Memory' from the musical Cats.\"FROM THE RIGHTRedStateWriting for RedState, a conservative blog, Nick Arama, a contributor to the site, noted that Mr. Trump answered a range of questions at the event and said that Mr. Trump \"showed more concern for his supporters than for his own safety.\"\"One of the people who fell ill even appeared to feel better as 'Ave Maria' was playing and the crowd cheered,\" Mr. Arama wrote.He also focused on Ms. Harris's reaction to Mr. Trump's town hall. After her campaign team posted on X that \"Trump appears lost, confused, and frozen onstage as multiple songs play for 30+ minutes and the crowd pours out of the venue early,\" Ms. Harris's personal account reposted it with a short message: \"Hope he's okay.\"Mr. Arama said the post showed that Ms. Harris was \"resorting to more and more desperate measures\" to mock Mr. Trump because of her \"imploding\" campaign.",

    "title": "Will Inflation Be Worse Under Trump or Harris? Here's What Economists Say",
    "content": "Dollar Scholar Asks: Is There Any Smart Financial Advice on TikTok?Although the current rate of inflation in the U.S. is roughly within normal bounds, it remains one of the greatest concerns for voters heading into the 2024 presidential election. But comparing the candidates' approaches to inflation -- both in the past and in the future -- is difficult.On one hand, the Biden-Harris administration's record is abysmal if you simply measure it based on how much prices have risen since the day the duo took office. Cumulative inflation is about 20% since January 2021. This is considered one of Vice President Kamala Harris' greatest electoral weaknesses, especially because prices really started spiking the winter President Joe Biden was inaugurated.On the other, policies have lasting effects long after a president leaves office. Many experts say former President Donald Trump's response to the pandemic -- and the stimulus spending in that era -- contributed to inflation and the economic challenges Biden has had to deal with.So, who will be better for inflation moving forward? Despite 54% of voters saying in a recent Gallup poll that they favor Trump to lead the overall economy, most economists pick Harris.In a new survey of 50 economists by the Wall Street Journal, 68% said inflation would be higher if Republican Trump's policies were to go into effect, while only 12% said it would be higher under Democrat Harris' plans. The other 20% said there would be no material difference.The Journal cited Trump's proposed tariffs as a driver of the large gap between how economists predict the candidates would handle inflation. On the campaign trail, Trump has said he would enact a 60% tariff (tax) on some Chinese goods and a tariff on foreign goods in general of at least 10%. While tariffs could help some American manufacturers, they would likely lead to higher prices for everyday consumers.In a separate panel of economists conducted by the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, 94% of respondents said they agree or strongly agree with the statement that \"imposing tariffs results in a substantial portion of the tariffs being borne by consumers of the country that enacts the tariffs, through price increases.\"Harris' inflation plans include initiatives to lower drug prices and curtail corporate \"price gouging\" that she blames for things like grocery inflation. That same panel of economists, however, generally agrees \"there is little empirical evidence that price gouging is causing high grocery prices.\"Whether inflation will be worse under Trump or Harris is ultimately for voters to decide, and their choice will likely rest on who they blame for the last bout of increased prices.Some of the questions voters are now asking -- like who, exactly, is responsible for the latest inflation crisis, and who could prevent it from happening again? -- bear similarities to age-old debates over economic responsibility in election years.A semi-recent example is the 2012 election, when former President Barack Obama took heat for his economic record and the pace of the nation's recovery from the Great Recession in his first term. But his victory could be seen as an indication that many voters recognized that he inherited a poor economy from the previous president, George W. Bush.Fast-forward to 2024, and despite many voters blaming Biden for the high prices they're facing, others seem to realize that his policies aren't the only reason they're paying $5 for eggs. The debate now is whether they'll be willing to look past the weak inflation stats from the past (almost) four years while choosing the country's next leader.Best Credit Cards of October 2024Americans Think Inflation Will Get Worse After the Election.

    "content": "The opinions expressed by contributors are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of RedState.com.Aside from not being a great candidate, one of the biggest things that doomed then-Sen. Kamala Harris' 2020 presidential run was the behind-the-scenes chaos and infighting among campaign staff at the state and national levels, where no one was on the same page, everyone was playing pass the buck, and there was no singular unifying message.As the New York Times reported in November 2019 - just a few days before Harris dropped out of the race - \"to some Harris allies, her decline is more predictable than surprising.\"\"In one instance after another, Ms. Harris and her closest advisers made flawed decisions about which states to focus on, issues to emphasize and opponents to target, all the while refusing to make difficult personnel choices to impose order on an unwieldy campaign,\" the Times also noted at the time after talking with \"50 current and former campaign staff members and allies.\"FLASHBACK: She's Free, Freefallin': Kamala Harris Places 'a Distant Fifth' in New Presidential Poll ... in CaliforniaFast forward to just a few weeks before the 2024 presidential election, and it would appear some of those same mistakes are happening all over again in the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania, where there has been a lot of external and internal grumbling along with meetings called after repeated complaints that her HQ there did not have it together:Top Democrats in Pennsylvania are worried Vice President Kamala Harris' operation is being poorly run in the nation's biggest battleground state.They say some Harris aides lack relationships with key party figures, particularly in Philadelphia and its suburbs. They complain they have been left out of events and surrogates haven't been deployed effectively. And they've urged Harris staff in private meetings to do more to turn out voters of color.For some Pennsylvania Democratic elected officials, party leaders and allies, 20 of whom POLITICO spoke to for this article, they're anxious the in-state operation has set them back.And complaints about outreach to voters of color are common in Democratic politics in Pennsylvania.But this level of frustration and finger-pointing is not.Needless to say, with roughly two and a half weeks to go before Election Day, now is not the time for campaigns in the key states, especially one as close as Pennsylvania, to scramble to hit the \"reset\" button. Then again, these issues could be seen coming from miles away:We're at a point in the election cycle where these things should be running like well-oiled machines. The fact that Harris' Pennsylvania HQ isn't at this stage is a deeply troubling sign for her campaign. Not that I'm complaining, of course, but in an ideal world for Kamala HQ, lessons would have been learned from her last embarrassing presidential run.But as we've said before, Kamala Harris was and always will be her own worst enemy. Would be something else if that inconvenient fact ultimately proved to be her campaign's undoing.",

    "title": "Former Fulton County Prosecutor Nathan Wade Says He Did 'Nothing to Compromise' Trump Case",
    "content": "A former Georgia special prosecutor who was involved in a Fulton County case against former President Donald Trump and others appeared before a House committee hearing for a deposition on Tuesday.Earlier this year, Willis and Wade became embroiled in controversy after a Trump co-defendant's attorney submitted court papers and witness testimony showing the pair were involved in a romantic relationship. The two ultimately conceded the relationship weeks later, although both denied allegations that the pair financially benefitted from the arrangement.In March, Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee, who wrote that an \"odor of mendacity\" hangs over the case, ruled that either Wade needs to step down from his position as special counsel in the case or Willis should remove herself. Wade later submitted his resignation, denying any wrongdoing.According to Wade's testimony before the panel, he said that the Trump case was \"not politically motived\" and did \"nothing to compromise the integrity\" of the case.\"My team and I investigated the issues in the election interference case for more than two years. This case was not politically motivated. Rather, it was an independent investigation based upon facts, interviews, evidence, and the rule of law. I had no mandate other than to honestly seek the truth,\" he wrote.He also disputed previous claims from Republicans that officials in the White House, the White House counsel's office, the House Jan. 6 investigative committee, or the U.S. Department of Justice were involved in the case.When asked during a break about whether Wade would invoke the Constitution's Fifth Amendment that protects individuals from self-incrimination, Wade's lawyer, former Georgia Democratic Gov. Roy Barnes, suggested that no crime was committed.\"What crime has been committed here?\" he asked.\"We gave our testimony, cooperated, and we're through,\" Barnes told reporters in the Capitol as Wade was standing near him in the hall.When asked whether he believed it was an effective meeting, Barnes responded in the affirmative. When asked why, he responded, \"We answered questions.\"Wade did not respond to any questions that reporters had asked him. No further details were provided, and Barnes would not answer questions about Willis or the case.In a letter directed to Wade in her official capacity, Willis warned him that he had confidentiality obligations in connection to the Trump case.\"It is incumbent upon you, and your counsel, to guard against the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information by invoking all applicable legal protections and privileges\" during the House deposition, Willis wrote to Wade.In her letter to the Judiciary Committee's Chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), Willis said that Wade's deposition may \"interfere with ongoing proceedings\" in the case, further suggesting that the panel should call off Wade's testimony in the matter.Willis's office has accused the former president and more than a dozen other individuals of trying to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia as well as racketeering charges.Trump and most of the co-defendants in the case have pleaded not guilty, although several people who were initially charged came to a plea agreement with prosecutors, pleading guilty in exchange for lighter penalties. The former president, who faces separate charges in other jurisdictions, has said the cases are politically motivated attempts to sway the 2024 presidential election.A court filing submitted by Willis's office over the summer attempted to have the appeals court dismiss the disqualification bid because there was not enough evidence.The Epoch Times contacted the Fulton County District Attorney's office and Wade's attorneys for comment but received no reply by publication time.",

    "content": "Supporters cheers as US Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris arrives to speak at a campaign event at the Erie Insurance Arena in Erie, Pennsylvania, on October 14, 2024.Five of the seven swing states in the 2024 presidential election improved their overall business climates during the Biden-Harris administration, according to CNBC's annual America's Top States for Business study. But that does not necessarily mean the states are better off economically, in an election cycle where the economy has consistently ranked at or near the top of voters' concerns.Since 2007, CNBC has been ranking all 50 states across ten categories of competitiveness to determine the best overall states in which to do business. Behind the rankings are dozens of metrics that offer a detailed picture of each state's business and economic climate.We compared the most recent rankings, published in July, with those from 2019 -- the last full year of data before the Covid-19 pandemic, and in many ways the peak of the Trump economy. Of the seven biggest battlegrounds in terms of polling and Electoral College heft, only Nevada and Wisconsin saw their overall rankings decline.The other 5 swing states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania -- all improved their standing.Of course, competitiveness is complicated. It often has every bit as much, or more, to do with state policies than what is happening in Washington. Still, there are plenty of statistics for both the Trump and Harris campaigns to either claim credit for, or to run away from.Here is how the business climates break down in the battlegrounds.",

    "title": "Presidents of the United States: John Tyler, a man and president of many firsts",
    "content": "Editor's Note: This profile is part of a series taking a closer look at US presidents ahead of the 2024 presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.John Tyler was a man of many firsts.He was the first Vice President to be elevated to the top job after the death of his predecessor. Critics thus dubbed him 'His Accidency.'At 51, he was at the time the youngest man to serve as president.He was also the first president whose wife died while in office - and was the first president to marry while in office. Tyler also served as a representative of the Confederacy.Let's take a closer look at the 10th President of the United States.Early lifeTyler was born on March 29, 1790, in Virginia's Charles City county into a wealthy planter family. His parents were John Tyler and Mary Armistead.John was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates during the American Revolution. He later served as Governor of Virginia. Tyler was raised on the family plantation in Greenway. He was taught to be a strict constitutionalist - to adhere to the document as written above all things.He attended the College of William & Mary - after which he began an apprenticeship with his father and ex-United States Attorney General Edmund Randolph in preparation for a career in the law. In 1809, Tyler was admitted to the bar.In 1813, he married Letitia Christian and bought a patch of land nearby and constructed his own plantation.PoliticsLike his father, Tyler began his career in the Virginia legislature. Tyler on multiple terms in the legislature, served as a United States representative, Virginia Governor and US Senator.Throughout his career, he showed consistent support for states' rights. Tyler also opposed the Missouri Compromise.Though he was a Democrat, Tyler would oppose some policies of then-president Andrew Jackson (1829-1837) - whom critics had dubbed a 'tyrant' and 'King Andrew.'In 1840, the Opposition Whig Party nominated Tyler as Benjamin Harrison's vice president. Their hope was to attract the support of those who backed states' rights in the South and despised what was called Jacksonian Democracy.Harrison and Tyler, known as \"Tippecanoe and Tyler Too,\" defeated the Democratic incumbents Martin Van Buren and Richard M Johnson.Time in officeOn April 4, 1841, Harrison passed away. It had been just a month since the inauguration. Tyler now became the first vice president to take the Oval Office after the death of the president.At the time, a debate broke out over exactly how much power Tyler would hold. Tyler, though, was in no doubt. He quickly assumed the full powers of the presidency and moved into the White House.Though the Whigs were not unduly unhappy, they would soon find themselves in a face-off with the man who was leading the country. Nearly the entire Cabinet resigned after Tyler vetoed two bills that aimed to reestablish a national bank.The Whigs then threw Tyler out of the party. By now, Tyler had also alienated his friends in the Democratic Party. He was president, but he was also a man without a party.A year later, the first impeachment resolution ever against a president was introduced in the House of Representatives.Despite the issues with the Congressional Whigs, Tyler's administration actually achieved some of its goals. These included passing the Log Cabin Bill, establishing the United States Weather Bureau, ending the Second Seminole war and the rebellion against the Rhode Island government.Tyler would also sign legislation to annex Texas before leaving office - arguably the biggest accomplishment of his presidency.By then, Tyler's wife Christian had passed away - making her the first president's wife to die while he served in office. Tyler then married Julia Gardiner - becoming the first president to marry while in office.Tyler in 1844 entered the race for president but found few takers for his candidacy. He ultimately threw his support behind James K Polk. In 1845, Tyler left the White House.When states began seceding in 1861 before Abraham Lincoln's inauguration, Tyler tried in vain to stop them. When he failed, he returned to Virginia and began working to establish the Confederacy. Tyler was elected to the Confederate House of Representatives shortly before his death in 1862.He was given a full state funeral by his 'countrymen.'LegacyThough Tyler was not a massively successful president, he did tread new ground. His stepping into the top job and assuming all the powers of the presidency set an example that is followed to this day.It also showed that the line of succession and the orderly transfer of power worked. In short, the system held.",

    "title": "24% of Americans say the winner of the 2024 Presidential election helps determine whether 'I'm rich'",
    "content": "(BPT) - Beyond the U.S. economy, one in two Americans believe the outcome of the 2024 Presidential election will directly impact their own personal finances, according to new research from Empower, a leader in financial planning, investing, and advice. In fact, a quarter (24%) say that the winner of the election helps determine \"whether I'm rich or not\" -- a belief more firmly held by the Middle Class -- reaching 27% for those with an income $50k-$100k, compared to 22% for those making under $50k; and 23% for people with incomes greater than $100k.Americans can count the ways they're invested in this year's election, with 42% saying the amount of money they have will be tangibly more or less depending on who wins. One third (33%) say their \"Wallet Power\" -- or their overall ability to spend, save, and invest -- will either shrink (33%) or increase (31%). More than a third (34%) believe the Presidential election is a major predictor of their retirement timeline and financial security, with 30% saying the winner will impact those plans, causing them to work longer, or have a shorter retirement (40% Gen Z, 39% Millennials).\"The adage is that 'all politics is local' -- and when it comes to money, it hits very close to home, with many Americans seeing a direct link between their own prosperity and the highest office in the land,\" says Rebecca Rickert, head of communications at Empower. \"From their retirement timeline to their account balances, people feel there is a lot riding on the outcome of the election in terms of their own financial happiness.\"Chief among the issues at stake, many Americans (42%) believe the winner of the Presidential election will get inflation and prices under control, making things more affordable (47% men, 38% women) at a time when many Americans say they're feeling \"The Big Shrink.\" One third (33%) say the winner of the Presidential election will make it easier to reach their personal financial goals, such as the 33% who say the victor will make it more affordable to buy a home (42% Millennials).The money moves on the ballotPeople say they'll make concrete money moves based on who wins: 41% will add more money to their emergency savings, save more cash (41% overall, 48% Millennials), and be more frugal with their spending (45%).More Americans say they are closely following the 2024 Presidential race than the stock market (67% vs. 33%), and half (53%) agree that uncertainty about the outcome of the Presidential election impacts the markets. One in four (23%) will invest more in the stock market based on the outcome of the Presidential election (32% Millennials) or change their asset allocation (34% Millennials). Nearly 1 in 5 (18%) plan to take more drastic measures, and say they will withdraw their money/liquidate their investments (27% Millennials).More findings:Empower's \"The Ticket: Money and Politics\" study is based on online survey responses from 2,200 Americans ages 18+ fielded by Morning Consult between July 22-24, 2024.

    "title": "Trump vows to 'end all sanctuary cities,' restore 'normalcy' at 'Faulkner Focus' town hall with female voters",
    "content": "'The Faulkner Focus' host Harris Faulkner previews her exclusive town hall with former President Trump, airing Wednesday.Former President Donald Trump vowed to end sanctuary cities and restore \"normalcy\" as he took questions from female voters concerned about a variety of issues ahead of Election Day, including the economy, crime and abortion.One woman, whose son attends the University of Georgia, pressed him on the issue of crime and public safety following the murder of nursing student Laken Riley earlier this year during the exclusive town hall Wednesday on \"The Faulkner Focus.\"TRUMP TAKES DETOUR TO ULTRA-BLUE CALIFORNIA TO SPOTLIGHT HARRIS' HOME TURF'S FAILED POLICIES: 'PARADISE LOST'\"My son is a Georgia Bulldog. He was on campus the day Laken Riley was murdered,\" the attendee told the former president. \"Terrifying for all those kids, right? I wanted to know... how quickly in a sanctuary city - like they're calling Athens, Georgia - how quickly can you remove those threats to our societies that our children can go out on a run as they rightfully should be able to do in a park in the daytime by themselves?\"\"We can do things in terms of moving people out. We can move them out of the sanctuary cities. We're going to end all sanctuary cities in the United States, and we're going to go back to normalcy,\" he pledged in response.\"And we're going to have law and order.\"Crime consistently ranks as a top issue for Republican voters nationwide, falling right behind the economy, which polls indicate is the largest motivator as constituents head to the ballot box.Recent polling showed former President Trump has a nine-point lead over Vice President Kamala Harris when it comes to handling the economy, the single most important issue for voters going into the 2024 presidential election.The Gallup poll found that 54% of Americans say Trump is more capable of handling the economy, compared to 45% for Harris. The economy ranked as the most important issue for Republicans and for all Americans, but it didn't rate in the top five for Democrats.One woman asked him about the rising cost of living for families and his plans for the child tax credit.\"I'm a single mom to two kids here, and just in three and a half years, my child tax credit has decreased by 80%,\" one attendee told Trump. \"Last year, I had broken my neck, and I tried applying for any kind of assistance and was denied because I did not make less than $700 a month... what kind of realistic changes that do you think you can provide  single parents, married parents, any kind of parent to just simply afford children in today's world, with the way things are here?\"\"I gave you the largest tax cuts in the history of our country,\" Trump said in response. \"Larger than the Reagan cuts. Larger. I understand exactly what you're saying. We're going to readjust things so that it's fair to everybody, because it's really not fair to everybody... We're going up higher, but we're also going to readjust because you have to make some readjustments.\"CHECK OUT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS IN THE 2024 ELECTION\"It's unfair to some people, and we're not going to have that,\" he continued.Another town hall attendee, Pamela, originally from California, asked the former president about abortion, a topic that ranks among the most important for some women as they head to the ballot box.\"Women are entitled to do what they want to and need to do with their bodies, including their unborn. That's on them regardless of the circumstance. Some are necessary to save their own lives,\" she said. \"Why is the government involved in women's basic rights?\"\"For 52 years, this issue has torn our country apart,\" Trump responded. \"Every legal scholar, the great ones, every lawyer - but the Democrats, the Republicans, the liberals, and conservatives, they wanted it brought out of the federal government and brought back to the states for a vote of the people. And like Ronald Reagan, I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest, life of the mother.\"\"I strongly believe... you have to follow your heart. Some people don't. It's a very small percentage, but you have to follow your heart,\" he continued. \"But you have the exceptions. But what we were able to do was through the courage of six Supreme Court justices. We were able to do this after years and years of turmoil.\"Abortion has ranked as a top issue for Democrats heading into Election Day, alongside democracy, education and health care.Trump also holds leads over Harris on immigration (54%-45%) and foreign affairs (52%-47%). Harris holds her own leads on the top issues for Democrats, however, including health care (54%-44%), abortion (56%-40%) and climate change (61%-35%).",

    "content": "Elon Musk is hitting the campaign trail in Pennsylvania this week as the 2024 presidential election nears.\"Tomorrow night through Monday, I will be giving a series of talks throughout Pennsylvania. If you'd like to attend one of my talks, there's no attendance fee. You just need to have signed our petition supporting free speech & right to bear arms & have voted in this election,\" Musk explained.\"To clarify, you need have voted in Pennsylvania,\" he added.Elon Musk said he will give \"a series of talks from tomorrow night through Monday\" in Pennsylvania, less than two weeks after the billionaire made a high-profile appearance with former president and Republican candidate Donald Trump there.Earlier last week, a source told Reuters that Musk plans more campaigning for Trump in Pennsylvania and his appearances would be connected to his America PAC political action committee.Pennsylvania is considered a crucial state for both Trump and his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, in the race for the Nov. 5 election.Musk's \"series of talks\" in the critical swing state follows his appearance on stage with President Trump at the historic Butler rally.Musk stated that one of the requirements for attending one of his talks was signing his pro-Trump Super PAC's petition supporting free speech and the right to bear arms.The petition from America PAC offers registered voters $47 for every registered voter in critical swing states they refer.\"The First and Second Amendments guarantee freedom of speech and the right to bear arms. By signing below, I am pledging my support for the First and Second Amendments,\" the petition reads.\"In appreciation for your support, you will receive $47 for each registered voter you refer that signs this petition,\" it continues.\"Our goal is to get 1 million registered voters in swing states to sign in support of the Constitution, especially freedom of speech and the right to bear arms. This program is exclusively open to registered voters in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina. Expires October 21,\" it adds.\"For every person you refer who is a swing state voter, you get $47! Easy money,\" Musk said.",

    "content": "Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris will give her first formal interview with Fox News on Wednesday. Below, find out what time the interview will start and get more details about the special broadcast.On Tuesday, October 15, Fox News announced that Vice President Harris will sit down with the chief political anchor, Bret Baier, for her first formal interview in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.The interview comes after Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, appeared on \"Fox News Sunday\" for the second consecutive week on Sunday. The Democratic ticket has ramped up its media appearances as the 2024 presidential election approaches in just a few weeks.Last week, Harris was interviewed by \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker and appeared on ABC's \"The View,\" \"The Howard Stern Show,\" the \"Call Her Daddy\" podcast, and Stephen Colbert's \"The Late Show.\"In response, former President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday that Harris \"has wisely chosen\" Baier to interview her because he is \"considered to be 'Fair & Balanced,' though often very soft to those on the 'cocktail circuit' Left.\" In a separate post, Trump argued that the news network \"has totally lost its way\" and claimed Harris' spokesperson, Ian Sams, \"virtually owns .\"Trump will appear on Fox News the same day as Harris' interview in a pre-taped town hall-style event that will focus \"on issues impacting women ahead of the election,\" including the \"economy, abortion, immigration, and health care,\" according to a Fox News press release.Kamala Harris' first formal interview with Fox News will start at 6 p.m. ET on Wednesday, Oct. 16.Fox News Channel's chief political anchor, Bret Baier, will interview Kamala Harris on Wednesday night during the Special Report with Bret Baier.Baier has moderated Republican presidential primary debates and town halls with candidates across the political spectrum.

    "title": "50-50 elections are bad for America",
    "content": "The 2024 presidential election is tied. Again. As I write this, Nate Silver's forecast is literally 50-50. And that's bad news for America.I'm not just saying this because it defies logic that a man who was twice impeached, convicted of 34 felony counts and found liable for sexual assault (just to mention three of Donald Trump's greatest hits) is a whisker away from winning the presidency. Nor am I saying this because the tight polls are causing Democrats to feel increasingly apoplectic -- a situation that surely isn't good for their mental health.I'm saying this because the last thing we need is another super-close election. It doesn't strain credulity to imagine that a close race could lead to a disputed outcome, which could then lead to violence.If that prospect isn't dicey enough, consider the possibility of a literal tie in the electoral college of 269-269. The winner would be determined based on which party controls the most state delegations in the House of Representatives, meaning that Trump would very likely emerge victorious.It's hard to imagine the toll that process might take on our nation.It is in everyone's best interest for the winner -- whoever that turns out to be -- to receive a decisive victory. But even if you rule out the nightmare scenarios that could be triggered by a close election, our 50-50 nation is symptomatic of a larger problem.With a few exceptions (such as Barack Obama's 2008 victory), we have been a divided nation for about a quarter of a century.We kicked off the 2000s with the Bush v. Gore recount in Florida, which left many Americans feeling disaffected. Next, in 2004 -- the only time a Republican has won the popular vote since 1988 -- the election came down to Ohio (leading some on the left to advance a vote fraud conspiracy theory).George W. Bush won a popular vote majority in 2004 by turning out the Republican base, on the theory that there weren't that many persuadable voters worth persuading. It was a shrewd, if fateful, strategy.The 2012 election might have ended decisively, but it was like watching a football game that felt close until the very end. Even Mitt Romney didn't see the end coming.In 2016, Trump won the presidency by virtue of just 77,744 votes in three states (while losing the popular vote by almost 3 million). And in 2020, Joe Biden won by virtue of a mere 42,844 votes in three states.The days when Ronald Reagan could win a 49-state landslide, and come away with at least something resembling a mandate, are long gone.Nowadays, nearly half the country feels perpetually disenfranchised.A confluence of factors have given us a nation where at least 45 percent of voters on each side are unshakably locked into their respective parties, no matter what happens (as Trump has boasted, he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not lose any voters; he was clearly correct).How did we get to be so tribal? Political and geographic sorting have conspired to insulate us from making friends with whom we disagree.The rise of partisan animosity since the 1990s has reduced our willingness to compromise (why would you compromise with evil?) -- and has undermined our openness to persuasion or even ticket splitting.And innovations such as talk radio, cable news, podcasts, YouTube and social media have allowed us to hide in our echo chambers, hardening our tribal identities -- while simultaneously radicalizing us by exposing us to some of the worst and most extreme voices from the other side.Now, you might think that an evenly divided nation is all well and good -- that perpetual close competition forces the parties to compete for our votes. But in a two-party system designed for consensus, the opposite is true. The party out of power can assume that they will win the next time, so why bother to improve or change, much less compromise with the party in power? Look no further than Trump's decision to kill the border bill for evidence.Conversely, upon winning office, newly elected leaders assume their tenure is fleeting. So they follow a \"go big or go home\" legislative strategy (see the mistakes Joe Biden made early on in his administration, when he postured as the next FDR or LBJ) -- an ambitious conceit that often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.Watching this race end in what looks to be a virtual tie makes me worry that it's Groundhog Day once again. While the outcome of the 2024 presidential race is hard to predict, it's a safe bet that it's going to be close -- and this alone makes the coming weeks and months very dangerous.A close outcome makes it easier for someone to claim the election was stolen. A close outcome makes it more likely there will be political violence. And a close election continues the vicious cycle that we have been stuck in for decades.Breaking this spell will require one party to eventually emerge as dominant. It's tighter than a tick, and that's a problem.",

    "title": "Virginia attorney general questions timing of DOJ voter lawsuit - Washington Examiner",
    "content": "Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares rebuffed the Department of Justice's new lawsuit against Virginia as Republicans spotlight the department's legal action against the state.The lawsuit, announced by the DOJ last week, was filed after Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) issued an executive order that removed over 6,300 noncitizens from the state's voter registration rolls in August. Miyares contended that the DOJ is lacking \"basic common sense\" with its legal action, noting how Youngkin used a law signed by Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), then governor of Virginia, back in 2006.\"My question is, where are all these left-wing groups that have brought this lawsuit when Tim Kaine signed this into law or when Ralph Northam or Terry McAuliffe were also similarly acting in a similar capacity?\" Miyares said on Fox News's Fox and Friends First. \"So I applaud Gov. Youngkin for wanting to make sure we have clean voting rolls. That's common sense, but as we all know, common sense isn't very common in D.C. these days.\"Miyares added that the DOJ's assessment that citizens were removed from the state's voter rolls is incorrect as noncitizens at the DMV confirm they are noncitizens. He also questioned why the DOJ is using its time and resources to fight the governor's action less than a month before the election, calling it \"misplaced priorities.\"During his appearance, Miyares recalled how his mother voted for the first time in her late 30s after fleeing Cuba, saying a person's right to vote is \"precious.\" However, Miyares reiterated that Youngkin's legal action does not target citizens and their right to vote and said he is \"looking forward\" to defending the governor's action.Miyares's appearance comes as Youngkin has also been spotlighting the DOJ's lawsuit against Virginia, appearing on both Fox News and CNN on Monday evening to discuss it. On CNN, the governor questioned why the lawsuit was filed just 25 days before the election, noting that the lawsuit appears \"far more political\" now than if it had been filed earlier.\n\"Why is it that anyone could argue that a process that removes noncitizens off of our voter rolls is anything else other than common sense and constitutional?\" Youngkin asked network anchor Jake Tapper.Virginia governors are limited to serving two nonconsecutive terms, meaning Youngkin will not be eligible to seek reelection next year. While Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, a Republican, announced her candidacy for the 2025 gubernatorial race last month, Miyares has said Republicans need to focus on the 2024 presidential election \"before even thinking about next year.\"",

    "title": "Has Kanye West been cloned? Inside the theory the rapper 'isn't the same person'",
    "content": "Reality star Kristin Cavallari just mainstreamed the niche internet theory by discussing it on her Let's Be Honest podcast, claiming she wholeheartedly 'believes it.'The 37-year-old referred to an online discussion topic that has faded in and out of obscurity over the past several years.The theory posits that rapper Kanye West, 47, has been replaced by a clone who looks almost identical to him and is living his life in his place.The 'evidence' to support the claim includes the assertion that Kanye's physical appearance has drastically changed in recent years, with his face supposedly changing shape and his height increasing by several inches.Purveyors of the idea also claim that nefarious - possibly government or Illuminati - forces were responsible for the shift, with their motivation being that Kanye was 'speaking too much truth.'The TV star claimed on her podcast that Kanye has said 'too much' in recent years, and therefore the version that is presenting himself to the world right now isn't actually him.She continued: 'I think there are clones, and I think Kanye is a clone. Remember when he was talking a lot? He was really saying too much and the cabal didn't like that.'The word 'cabal' - which means a secret political clique or faction - has become a buzzword among American far-right conspiracy theorists in recent years. It's usually used to refer to an ambiguous, usually left-wing, usually Jewish, group of powerful forces bent on keeping 'the truth' (another ambiguity) from being found out by the average citizen.When QAnon supporters discuss the fantasy that President Joe Biden stole the 2020 election, they often blame 'the cabal' for the subterfuge.The same term comes up among those who, more recently, have become convinced with zero evidence that federal responders are diverting disaster relief money to house undocumented migrants in the wake of Hurricane Milton, which devastated a large swatch of the South Eastern United States earlier this month.It seems that if you want to blame somebody for something, 'the cabal' is a reliable catch-all among conspiracy-minded right-wingers who are falling victim to misinformation more and more often in the lead-up to the 2024 US presidential election.Cavallari continued: 'He  said, \"If I go away and I come back and I look different, that is not me.\" And what the f*** happened? He was gone. Remember when he fell off the face of the earth?'Compare old photos of him. It's not the same f****** person!'She also insisted that Britney Spears has been replaced by a clone, to which guest co-host Justin Anderson argued that he had worked with Britney's sister Jamie Lynn on multiple occasions, but the Laguna Beach star refused to back down.She said: 'I believe this with every ounce of my body but people who are going to come out and say something get killed.'Cavallari initially posted a TikTok of her espousing the theory but later deleted it from her account, but that hasn't stopped the idea from spreading with increased gusto. Cavallari has 4.9million followers on Instagram alone.The theory first began circulating several years ago thanks to an interview clip in which Kanye said: 'If I ever go anywhere you'll know why.'The video is often misquoted, with many people (including Cavallari) remembering the quote as: 'If I ever disappear and come back, it's not me.'While some people spreading the theory online seem to only be looking to cause controversy or 'rage bait' to get engagement, a quick scroll through Reddit or X makes it all too evident that many people seem to buy into the idea.X user @CarolinaIsabelF wrote: 'Honestly, I kind of agree with Kristin on this one -- Kanye has been acting super weird lately. Whether it's the clone theory or not, something definitely feels off. It wouldn't be the first time strange things happen in Hollywood, and when people start exposing secrets, you never know how far the powers-that-be will go to keep things quiet. It's definitely got me thinking!'@Sweetemmilyn posted: 'Lol. Does make you think. Kanye totally reversed course after his forced lockdown. No longer freedom loving talk. Went back to creepy and angry, dating a sexpot, and doesn't care about her being modest like he did with Kim. So I have to lean toward the possibility she's right though.'@DavidLCorbo posted a recent photo of the rapper with the caption: 'This is NOT Kanye. This is a clone. The man recently called himself the new Jesus and I said to myself \"that's it, we've lost him.\" But I can't ignore what my eyes are seeing. This ain't him. Fight me.'Cavallari also posted the clip on her Instagram and the comments are...startling.@ginalolla wrote: 'The fact that people (like your cohost) think there's absolutely no way this could happen, is astonishing to me. I think everyone just doesn't want to believe how much control some people have in this world.'@hbsellsohaz agreed, writing: 'Girl you are awake.'@stephanieannfenton posted: 'Yesssssss Kristin!!!! Love you more!!! 🙌🙌 it's not freaking Kanye!!! Look at Diddy too. His eyes are so close together now and it doesn't even look like him.'There are also those online who are quick to laugh at the theory, with one Reddit user writing: 'Ye clone theory is ridiculous and nobody ever gives a reason as to why he would be cloned.'Any difference in Kanye's appearance can most reasonably be chalked up to the simple passage of time, something that seems lost on posters sharing side-by-side photos of Kanye from 2006 and 2024 and going on about how different he looks after 20 years of aging.Many also reference a photo in which Kanye is obviously wearing shoulder pads, claiming the difference in his shoulders proves he's a copy of the original rapper.As for the erraticness of his opinions and social media outbursts, the story is likely much simpler and sadder than a government clone.The rapper, who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, has been displaying increasingly erratic behaviour in recent years, clearly suffering from the symptoms of the mental health disorder.But logic is obviously not at the forefront of the 'Kanye is a clone' movement. Instead, the theory is likely rooted in thinly veiled anti-semitism.The Gold Digger rapper sparked controversy for antisemitic remarks in 2023, resulting in his being banned from Twitter and Instagram for violating the rules of the social media platforms.He later apologised for the comments and hasn't spoken on the topic since - which Kanye clone-conspiracy-theorists think proves he was replaced by a pawn beholden to powerful forces who don't want him revealing dangerous 'truths.'Many posts about the theory refer to these remarks when discussing the 'truths' Kanye was supposedly telling.One Redditor not-so-subtly posted: 'He got taken out for speaking the truth, that's a clone. We all know who ended him, it's the certain group of people he criticised in his tweets...'It's worth noting Cavallari may be unaware of the antisemitic and right-wing undertones of the Kanye clone theory and just thinks the rapper has looked different recently.But the seemingly harmless conspiracy is part of a larger, more complex web of misinformation that has infected right-wing American politics to a dangerous degree - and Cavallari's endorsement is further proof that these ideas are finding their way into the mainstream.If you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we'd love to hear from you.MORE : Trump claims Harris has 'dangerous' health problems - like seasonal allergiesMORE : Bianca Censori was Kanye West's 'orgy coordinator' according to shocking new claims",

She announced this year that she will vote for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.In a statement, the Committee on House Administration's Subcommittee on Oversight said that its Republican chairman, Barry Loudermilk, \"obtained never-before-seen correspondence between January 6 Select Committee Vice-Chair Liz Cheney and Cassidy Hutchinson and in 2022, while Hutchinson was still a subject of the Select Committee's investigation.\"The statement added: \"In the months prior to Hutchinson's explosive private and public testimony, Cheney communicated with Hutchinson, both directly and through an intermediary -- Alyssa Farah Griffin -- while Hutchinson was represented by her attorney, Stefan Passantino.\"Newsweek sought email comment from Cheney and Griffin on Wednesday.It is clear from the communication that Griffin told Hutchinson that Cheney wanted \"a follow up with you, with your lawyer that she and  Dan George can lead.\" This suggests that both Cheney and Griffin wanted to ensure that Hutchinson had legal representation at the meetings. The January 6 committee conducted six interviews of Hutchinson in total.\"Farah Griffin and Hutchinson knew each other from their time working together in the White House. Farah Griffin was one of the first former Trump administration officials to publicly criticize Trump in January 2021, and was publicly working with the Select Committee on its investigation,\" the oversight committee's statement reads.Hutchinson and Griffin met in Washington, and the former told the latter that she had new information to give the January 6 committee.\"Her new testimony would include her never-before-heard story that alleged that President Trump agreed with rioters chanting 'Hang Mike Pence,'\" the statement reads.\n\"However, it appears that Cheney knew communicating with Hutchinson while Hutchinson was represented by an attorney and a subject of the Select Committee's investigation, without going through Hutchinson's attorney, would be unethical\" the statement continues.\"This is evident by Farah Griffin's text to Hutchinson that Cheney's 'one concern was so long as  you have counsel, she can't really ethically talk to you without him,'\" the oversight committee's statement adds.",

    "title": "Who Will Win the 2024 Election, Trump or Harris? Newsweek Readers' Verdicts",
    "content": "With only 20 days left before Election Day, when voters will have their final say on who they want to be the next president of the United States, both candidates appear locked in a dead heat as they race toward the White House.However, aside from Arizona and Georgia, where Trump leads by 1.6 and 1.1 points, respectively, 538's polling aggregates show the candidates separated by less than a point in the remainder of the battlegrounds. With margins so narrow, just a few thousand votes could determine the outcome in this year's crucial swing states, and the election as a whole.In an online poll, we asked: 'Who will win the 2024 election?' Over a thousand readers took part, with Harris achieving a slight lead over her rival. Newsweek readers from both camps also wrote in to share their predictions - and thoughts - on who will be crowned victorious in the 2024 presidential election. Here is a selection of those comments, lightly edited for clarity. The results of the poll are at the end of this article.Donald TrumpIn my opinion, his experience by far outshines that of Harris. Trump's intuition is right on target and he cares for the country. He's capable of dealing with the global political master-minds, whereas Harris's capability here is doubtful. In my opinion, his actual opinion re. Ukraine is more favorable towards the E.U. stance than seems apparent. And the \"proof in the pudding\" is that with him we had no wars and small businesses were not hampered by the many restrictions Democrats, who wish to control everything and everyone, place on them. That's my story and I'm sticking with it - An Independent voter. Maija CollinsKamala HarrisDonald is not competent. He has no ideas. His concepts are from the Heritage Foundation. He is a puppet, and Heritage is running the show. He is emulating Orban. He is a copycat politician. He cannot think on his own. He is too old, and he is divisive. He is also very disrespectful toward woman and those who do not agree with. Why is he a candidate? A convicted felon and sexual assaulter. This is a disgrace. Taylor ThompsonDonald TrumpI am sad to say but I think Trump is going to win. He has a very dedicated fan base and viewed from over here in the UK it looks as if the GOP and Trump himself have done a good job in stacking the electoral system towards themselves. He is of course a very divisive figure so those states which are Republican and those that a Democrat are more firm in their standing.

Enter, Florida man, or men, as it were.An antisemitism advocacy group called @StopAntisemitism replied to the post and outed one of the men on the boat as a loud and proud Neo-Nazi Jon Minadeo II of the Goyim Defense League, a hate group as designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Newsweek noted that Minadeo was once arrested in Poland outside of the Auschwitz death camp for spreading extremist propaganda. Sounds like this lil' boat stunt is right up his alley.The Trump campaign has responded to the controversy and in true manipulative MAGA fashion, have spun the incident into a grand conspiracy. Says campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt to Newsweek:\"Kamala's supporters are reaching all-time lows. Social media posts show that genuine Trump supporters identified these idiots as liberal activists trying to create fake news. They clearly responded accordingly.\"The \"genuine Trump supporters\" that Leavitt is referencing are in the above video.

    "title": "Kamala Harris Unveils Crypto Policies with a Focus on Black Investors",
    "content": "Critics question whether Harris's policies will genuinely help Black Americans or create additional barriers in the crypto landscape.Kamala Harris, a prominent candidate for the 2024 presidential election, has announced her first specific crypto policy. According to a tweet by TodayCryptoRj, Harris plans to support a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency and other digital assets aimed at protecting Black men who invest in these assets. The move has sparked debate, with some criticizing it as race-based favoritism, while others see potential for bipartisan collaboration.This policy is a change in Harris's stance, especially since her campaign was initially viewed as anti-crypto. The co-chair of the Harris campaign, Cedric Richmond, explained that this announcement is a component of the larger \"Opportunity Economy\" promise made by Harris.With the help of this effort, Black males will have access to chances for wealth-building, entrepreneurship, and homeownership, among other tools necessary for them to succeed in the market. However, concerns remain about whether these policies will make it easier or harder for Black Americans to participate in the crypto industry, particularly with Bitcoin.Anybody, regardless of race, color, or creed, has equal access to Bitcoin because it is an open-source protocol. Many members of the Bitcoin community feel that Harris's policy focusing on race is not enough because Bitcoin promotes diversity by default. Critics argue that the policy appears to pander to specific voter demographics rather than address the broader need for innovation in the industry.Moreover, comparing Harris's approach to that of former President Donald Trump, some argue that Trump's policies offer more inclusive benefits for the entire crypto community. His pro-Bitcoin stance is seen as fostering innovation for all Americans without favoring any particular demographic.Additionally, there is growing skepticism within the crypto community regarding Harris's so-called \"crypto pivot.\" While some, including Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, have backed Harris, others remain unconvinced. The key question is whether her policies will genuinely benefit all Bitcoiners or create more hurdles for Black investors.",

    "title": "US presidential elections: Allan Lichtman's 'Nostradamus' prophecies",
    "content": "With the US presidential election in just a few weeks, several pollsters are busy conducting opinion polls and analysing them. Political polls, however, are not necessarily reliable indicators of election results, especially in a close contest.On the other hand, Allan Lichtman, a history professor at American University in Washington, DC, has made a straightforward yet almost Nostradamus-like prediction about the US presidential elections that has, thus far, had a 90% accuracy rate.Well, how many pollsters can boast such a coveted prediction record? Using an unconventional approach he and his geophysicist friend Vladimir Keilis-Borok developed in 1981, Lichtman disregarded opinion polls and pundits in favour of examining the fundamental issues that, according to them, have shaped every presidential election since 1860.Since 1984, his prediction system, \"The Keys to the White House,\" has been evaluating the strength and performance of the incumbent party and predicting the outcomes of US presidential elections using 13 historical factors, or \"keys\" (four political, seven performance, and two personality).The Gore missHe has been right in all except one of his predictions, which was George W. Bush's contested triumph against Al Gore in 2000. Lichtman, however, contends that even that stain is unfair, pointing out that thousands of votes that were disallowed came from people who had honestly attempted to support Gore but unintentionally spoilt their ballots. Thirteen broad, true-false questions that gauge the effectiveness of the White House party are the keys.The party mandate, White House scandal, incumbency, primary contest, third party, shortand long-term economies, policy changes, incumbent and challenger charisma, foreign policy success and failure, and social unrest are the keys. Lichtman's model predicts that the incumbent party's candidate will lose if six or more keys are against them.And, in early September, Lichtman predicted Kamala Harris would win the 2024 presidential election this time around; eight of the 13 keys supported her. Lichtman argues that the Democrats gained House seats even though they lost seats, so the midterm gains key is false for Harris. The incumbent key is also false because Biden withdrew from the contest.It is to be noted that Lichtman had previously angrily objected to replacing Biden as the Democratic nominee following his appalling performance in the June debate and rejected the veracity of opinion polls suggesting that Biden's chances of winning had been harmed.Harris's chancesAccording to Lichtman, Harris benefitted from the lack of a formidable third party due to the withdrawal of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s independent campaign, favourable short- and long-term economic indicators, significant legislative accomplishments carried out by the Biden administration, and the absence of social unrest or scandal surrounding the White House.In addition, she had the advantage of not having to fight for the party's nomination to replace Biden, as she gained the support of other contenders before the Democratic National Convention last month. Even if two still unresolved keys on foreign policy achievements or failures fell in Trump's favour, they would not be enough for him to win the election, according to Lichtman's formula. Lichtman, however, ignores polling trends, campaign tactics, and events.Even an event like Taylor Swift's endorsement has little bearing on Lichtman's 13-point model. However, that can shape public perception and even voting turnout. \"None of these ephemeral events, not the debate, not the purported attempted assassination, not JD Vance saying he made up a story about immigrants eating cats and dogs... None of that changes the fundamentals of the election,\" Lichtman said. But is America really ready to elect a woman of colour to the presidency and create history? Is it really that simple this time?\"My prediction is that Kamala Harris will win in 2024, but everyone still needs to VOTE,\" Lichtman stated recently. It should be mentioned that despite his success, Lichtman's methodologies have frequently been questioned by political scientists, pollsters, and other historians who claim that his model is unscientific and too simplistic.And, to be honest, assessing some of the keys is quite subjective. And one wonders, amid the waves of opinion polls, if similar \"keys\" may be created for the Indian elections as well - possibly by sifting through historical election data?Given the complex, heterogeneous, and multifaceted nature of our elections in a truly multi-party system where various strong regional parties and various types of pre- and post-poll alliances exist and undergo constant evolution, that may be a more daunting and subjective endeavour. Can any political pundit, though, attempt to formulate such a model? That might add more fun to election prediction, for sure.The writer is Professor of Statistics, Indian Statistical Institute, KolkataSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on October 16, 2024",

    "content": "New texts have emerged of alleged secret communication between Liz Cheney, former January 6 committee vice chair, and a key witness.Former White House official Cassidy Hutchinson was due to testify that she saw then-President Donald Trump agreeing with January 6 rioters who were chanting \"Hang Mike Pence,\" the then-vice president.Republican National Committee member, Harmeet Dhillon, wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday: \"This is a very serious ethical violation and lawyers can be disciplined by the bar for contacting a represented party concerning the subject matter of the representation, without the permission and knowledge of that party's lawyer.\"The Congressional Committee on House Administration has issued a statement in which it says that Cheney, then a Republican congresswoman who was strongly opposed to Trump, had used third-party communications to arrange a meeting with Hutchinson before her 2022 testimony.Cheney, who lost her seat later in 2022, has been a frequent target of pro-Trump Republicans. She announced this year that she will vote for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.In a statement, the Committee on House Administration's Subcommittee on Oversight said that its Republican chairman, Barry Loudermilk, \"obtained never-before-seen correspondence between January 6 Select Committee Vice-Chair Liz Cheney and Cassidy Hutchinson and in 2022, while Hutchinson was still a subject of the Select Committee's investigation.\"The statement added: \"In the months prior to Hutchinson's explosive private and public testimony, Cheney communicated with Hutchinson, both directly and through an intermediary -- Alyssa Farah Griffin -- while Hutchinson was represented by her attorney, Stefan Passantino.\"Newsweek sought email comment from Cheney and Griffin on Wednesday.It is clear from the communication that Griffin told Hutchinson that Cheney wanted \"a follow up with you, with your lawyer that she and  Dan George can lead.\" This suggests that both Cheney and Griffin wanted to ensure that Hutchinson had legal representation at the meetings. The January 6 committee conducted six interviews of Hutchinson in total.\"Farah Griffin and Hutchinson knew each other from their time working together in the White House. Farah Griffin was one of the first former Trump administration officials to publicly criticize Trump in January 2021, and was publicly working with the Select Committee on its investigation,\" the oversight committee's statement reads.Hutchinson and Griffin met in Washington, and the former told the latter that she had new information to give the January 6 committee.\"Her new testimony would include her never-before-heard story that alleged that President Trump agreed with rioters chanting 'Hang Mike Pence,'\" the statement reads.\n\"However, it appears that Cheney knew communicating with Hutchinson while Hutchinson was represented by an attorney and a subject of the Select Committee's investigation, without going through Hutchinson's attorney, would be unethical\" the statement continues.\"This is evident by Farah Griffin's text to Hutchinson that Cheney's 'one concern was so long as  you have counsel, she can't really ethically talk to you without him,'\" the oversight committee's statement adds.",

    "content": "Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents uncovered a massive drug haul of blue fentanyl pills that may be worth more than $11 million stashed in a vehicle in California.Officers discovered 122 pounds of narcotics concealed within the vehicle's quarter panel during a routine inspection at the Calexico West Port of Entry on Oct. 9, the agency said in a statement dated yesterday.The estimated street value of the drugs is thought to be about $11 million based on a previous 123.6-pound discovery of blue fentanyl pills in March. Newsweek contacted the CBP to confirm the estimated value of the drugs.During the initial inspection, which involved a CBP K-9 sniffer dog unit, officers discovered the packages and referred the driver and the vehicle for further examination. A 47-year-old man was then taken into custody, suspected of attempting to smuggle the drugs into the United States from Mexico.CBP officers uncovered a total of 98 packages concealed within the vehicle's quarter panels and back headrest. The substance tested positive for fentanyl, according to CBP.Homeland Security Investigations has launched a full investigation into the matter, and inquiries remain ongoing.\"This fentanyl pill seizure is a big win in our fight against the opioid crisis,\" Roque Caza, area port director of Calexico, said in the statement. \"Every pill off the streets is a life potentially saved. I commend our hardworking CBP officers and law enforcement partners for keeping our communities safe.\"The latest drug bust is part of ongoing CBP efforts to intercept and prevent the trafficking of illicit narcotics into the country.Terri Beth Miller, senior editor at Rehab.com, told Newsweek that the CBP \"urgently\" needs more personnel to deal with the \"surge\" of drugs flowing through the southern border.\"Fentanyl is infiltrating communities across the U.S. No city, state, or region is immune. However, the overwhelming majority of fentanyl seizures, more than 95%, occur at the southwestern border of the U.S.\"Though illegal border crossings are often blamed for the surge of fentanyl into the US, the reality is that fentanyl is most commonly smuggled into the U.S. through legal ports of entry.\"This speaks to the urgent need for more DEA, Customs and Border Patrol resources at the southern border. A surge of law enforcement personnel, border agents and drug interdiction technologies is desperately needed.\"Immigration and border security are key issues in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election, as both Republicans and Democrats want to see curbs on migration.According to a poll by Gallup, 55 percent of respondents who back Donald Trump's calls for curbs wanted to see immigration levels decrease.A slight majority of respondents back Trump's flagship border wall policy from 2016, as 53% support significantly expanding the construction of walls along the U.S.-Mexico border, up 13 points since 2019.In an Economist/YouGov poll conducted in August, former president Trump led Vice President Kamala Harris by 51 points among adults who said immigration was \"very important\" to them-with 83 percent saying they planned to back Trump compared to 32 percent who said they would vote for Harris.Polling by Redfield and Wilton Strategies shows that 47 percent of respondents trust Trump on immigration compared to 36 percent who trust Harris. That is a gap that has been closing in recent weeks, as border crossings have fallen sharply in the aftermath of President Joe Biden's executive order limiting asylum claims.",

    "content": "With only 20 days left before Election Day, when voters will have their final say on who they want to be the next president of the United States, both candidates appear locked in a dead heat as they race toward the White House.However, aside from Arizona and Georgia, where Trump leads by 1.6 and 1.1 points, respectively, 538's polling aggregates show the candidates separated by less than a point in the remainder of the battlegrounds. With margins so narrow, just a few thousand votes could determine the outcome in this year's crucial swing states, and the election as a whole.In an online poll, we asked: 'Who will win the 2024 election?' Over a thousand readers took part, with Harris achieving a slight lead over her rival. Newsweek readers from both camps also wrote in to share their predictions - and thoughts - on who will be crowned victorious in the 2024 presidential election. Here is a selection of those comments, lightly edited for clarity. The results of the poll are at the end of this article.In my opinion, his experience by far outshines that of Harris. Trump's intuition is right on target and he cares for the country. He's capable of dealing with the global political master-minds, whereas Harris's capability here is doubtful. In my opinion, his actual opinion re. Ukraine is more favorable towards the E.U. stance than seems apparent. And the \"proof in the pudding\" is that with him we had no wars and small businesses were not hampered by the many restrictions Democrats, who wish to control everything and everyone, place on them. That's my story and I'm sticking with it - An Independent voter. Maija CollinsDonald is not competent. He has no ideas. His concepts are from the Heritage Foundation. He is a puppet, and Heritage is running the show. He is emulating Orban. He is a copycat politician. He cannot think on his own. He is too old, and he is divisive.

Murder decreased more than 11%, while rape fell roughly 9%.The decreases follow a sharp uptick in crime during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the murder rate spiked in its largest single-year increase on record. Violent crime then ticked back down slightly in 2021 and again in 2022, according to the FBI's national crime estimates.Crime rates have become a key issue in the 2024 presidential election. Monday's report on violent crime trends runs counter to claims by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has repeatedly attacked Democratic rival Kamala Harris for her record on crime and safety and claimed without evidence that migrants who cross the border illegally are responsible for a rising tide of violent crime.President Joe Biden, in a statement, praised the decline in crime, noting his administration's investments in public safety and executive actions on guns. Harris said that while the numbers represented \"great progress, we are not stopping now.\"\"I am committed to continuing our work to support local law enforcement, invest in proven crime prevention and community violence intervention, and address gun violence with commonsense gun safety laws,\" Harris, a former prosecutor and district attorney in California, said.Crime has generally been trending down since the 1990s. The continued decrease in 2023 is unsurprising given preliminary data that had already been released, but it's hard to explain exactly what's driving the change, according to Jeff Asher, a crime-data analyst who has worked at the CIA and Department of Defense.\"You talk to 10 criminologists, and you might get 10 different answers,\" Asher told USA TODAY. \"So explaining it is very difficult with any form of crime data, especially when you're sort of in the middle of the trend.\"In the latest report released Monday, aggravated assaults declined an estimated 2.8% and robbery fell 0.3%. Despite the overall decrease, instances of certain offenses, including motor vehicle theft and hate crimes, rose in 2023, according to the FBI, which cautioned that the increase in hate crimes could be due to higher reporting.Trump has said that if he's reelected, he would institute the death penalty for human traffickers and drug dealers, and he does not believe federal statistics like the FBI's report showing that violent crime trends are declining. FBI officials declined to comment when asked about Trump's claims in a call with reporters but said the agency's methodology has been consistent.Ernesto Lopez, a senior research specialist at the Council on Criminal Justice noted that while national trends are moving one way, the effects may not be felt equally in all cities, which could lead to public misconceptions about crime rates.Law enforcement agencies in the nation's largest cities - those with at least 1 million people - showed a 7% decrease in violent crime in 2023, while communities with between 250,000 and 499,999 people reported a 0.3% increase, FBI data showed.\"It's a complicated story, but it's also one that's consistent with past findings that perceptions don't necessarily match the numbers,\" Lopez said.FBI report: Reported hate crimes at schools and colleges are on the riseReport Violent crime rates in American cities largely fall back to pre-pandemic levelThe FBI found motor vehicle thefts rose more than 12%, while the Council on Criminal Justice found the thefts increased 29% in just 34 cities, Lopez said. Both Lopez and Asher said TikTok videos showing viewers how to steal certain models of cars may have contributed to increases.Violent crime rose 5.6% during the COVID-19 pandemic and nationwide protest movement following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Violent crime went down 1% in 2021 and another 1.7% in 2022, according to the FBI's national crime estimates.\"Whenever you have a period of rapid social change, it's not necessarily uncommon that you could see crime increase,\" Lopez said. \"And so as you start moving away from that and other social forces begin to normalize, you would expect crime trends to sort of return back to where they were before, and I think that's what we're seeing to some extent.\"Hate crimes have been on the rise in the United States for several years, but national hate crime data is notoriously flawed because it's not mandatory for all of the country's more than 18,000 law enforcement agencies to submit data on hate crimes. In 2023, roughly 16,000 agencies submitted data to the FBI.Adjusting for year-to-year fluctuations and using data from agencies with more consistent reporting, the FBI found hate crimes actually fell by 0.6% from 10,687 in 2022 to 10,627 in 2023, the agency told reporters.Other datasets show the true total is likely much higher, Brian Levin, professor emeritus and founder of the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino previously told USA TODAY. Levin's analysis of the nation's 10 most populous cities found hate crimes reported to police increased 16% in 2023, according to a draft of the report.Asher said his data from about 300 cities, known as the Real-Time Crime Index, indicates murders have dropped even more sharply this year. Preliminary reports published this summer from the Major Cities Chiefs Association and the Council on Criminal Justice also show crime has continued to drop in 2024.Lopez said the decline can possibly be attributed to large drops in homicides in cities that historically have high rates, while cities with historically lower homicides rates have remained elevated.\"I think overall, you know, it looks promising,\" he said. \"What we're seeing with a lot of violent crime  from the FBI report, but also from our report, is that it doesn't appear to be trending back up.\"",

    "content": "Former President Donald Trump's odds of winning the presidency in November soared to a 16-point lead over his Democratic opponent Kamala Harris on the leading prediction website Polymarket this week.As of Tuesday afternoon, the site gave Trump a 58% chance of winning the 2024 presidential election in three weeks, compared to a 42% chance for Harris. The spike represents the Republican's biggest lead on the site since July 31.Harris sits at her lowest Polymarket odds since the Democratic National Committee (DNC) controversially declared her as the party's nominee in early August.Polymarket indicated Tuesday that there is a 26% chance Trump will sweep all seven battleground states on November 5 - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.Click here to \nThe site also gave Trump a 16% chance of winning all but one of those swing states.At the time, Polymarket listed Trump's odds of carrying Arizona at 68%, Georgia at 64%, North Carolina at 63%, Pennsylvania at 56%, Michigan at 54%, and Wisconsin at 53%.Nevada was the only swing state where Polymarket gave Harris an advantage, albeit a razor-thin one of 51% to Trump's 50%.However, even if Trump loses Nevada to Harris, he would still win the election with 306 electoral votes if he gains the support of all the states in which Polymarket currently shows he is leading.One week ago, Polymarket had given Trump a smaller 52.6% chance of winning the 2024 election compared to Harris' 46.7% chance.As CatholicVote noted last week, before Monday, October 7, \"Harris was considered by the site's odds to be the slight favorite to win the election since September 12 - two days after the sole debate between her and Trump.\"On Tuesday of last week, Polymarket gave Harris a slight 53% advantage in the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Trump now enjoys roughly the same advantage in both states, according to Polymarket.On Monday morning, political commentator Collin Rugg wrote on X (formerly Twitter): \"Bettors are becoming increasingly confident Trump will win the election as he surges to nearly a double-digit lead.\"Trump's eight-point Polymarket lead then doubled within a day.\"The development comes as a new NBC News poll shows Trump pulling even with Kamala Harris after being behind by 5 points in their poll last month,\" Rugg pointed out.CatholicVote previously reported that Polymarket \"brands itself as 'the world's largest prediction market.'\"\"Via one of its web pages, it states that its markets 'seek truth' and 'reflect accurate, unbiased, real-time probabilities for events that matter most to you,'\" CatholicVote indicated.",

    "content": "Two recent movies about former U.S. presidents have had significantly different starts at the box office.The Apprentice took $482,803 per day on average during its first four days, earning a high of $590,628 on its opening day and $317,980 on its fourth -- the latest daily figure available -- on October 14.Reagan took $2.58 million per day on average during its first four days, raking in $2.7 million on its opening day and $2.65 million three days later on Labor Day.Reagan has appeared in more theaters. At its peak it was screened at 2,770 venues compared to 1,740 cinemas so far showing The Apprentice.The Reagan biopic was universally panned by critics, being dubbed \"the worst kind of hagiography\" in The Boston Globe and \"the worst movie of the year\" on The Daily Beast website.Yet the movie appeared to go down well with audiences, defying box office expectations and earning a 98 percent score among verified audience reviewers on movie-rating site Rotten Tomatoes at time of publication.Reagan was independently financed, with a grassroots marketing campaign which paled in comparison to some advertising budgets for Hollywood movies. Directed by Sean McNamara, it was loosely based on The Crusader: Ronald Reagan and the Fall of Communism, a 2006 book written by Paul Kengor.The Apprentice was made with a $16 million budget and tells a version of Trump's life in New York in the 1970s and 1980s, focusing on his relationships with his lawyer Roy Cohn and his first wife, Ivana Trump.The movie stars Sebastian Stan as Trump, Jeremy Strong as Cohn and Maria Bakalova as Ivana Trump.The Trump biopic also faced a huge challenge to be released in theaters, after struggling to find a distributor after it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in France in May. Director Ali Abbasi described making the movie and then getting it released as the \"most challenging thing I've ever done.\"\"When we were at  Cannes and we got a standing ovation and everyone was so happy and flattering, I was thinking there was going to be a bidding war, do I want to go with Warner or Netflix, who do I want to pick?\" he told the BBC, adding that \"it was extremely difficult for us to get a distributor,\" which he believed was because Trump threatened legal action.Trump criticized the movie on his social media platform Truth Social before it premiered.\"A FAKE and CLASSLESS Movie written about me, called, The Apprentice (Do they even have the right to use that name without approval?), will hopefully 'bomb,\" the Republican presidential candidate in November's election wrote.\"It's a cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country, 'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!'\"",

    "content": "Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump holds a campaign rally in Reno, Nevada, U.S. October 11, 2024. REUTERS/Fred GreavesOne complicated congressional law could stand between the White House and a former president Donald Trump armed with legal wiles rather than Electoral College votes, according to a new analysis.Georgetown University Law Center professor Neal Katyal argued Wednesday in a New York Times editorial that the nation should brace itself for a sprawling legal battle should Trump lose the presidential election to Vice President Kamala Harris in November.\"The rogues are no longer amateurs,\" wrote Katyal. \"They have spent the last four years going pro, meticulously devising a strategy across multiple fronts -- state legislatures, Congress, executive branches and elected judges -- to overturn any close election.\"Katyal details several paths a defeated Trump could take to seize executive power -- among them challenging ballots in swing state lawsuits, sowing chaos on local election boards and forcing fake electors on allies in the state legislature -- before landing on the one through Congress.His analysis comes with good and bad news introduced with an alarming disclaimer.\"The Congress has the power to swing the entire election,\" Katyal said. \"The rules are complex -- even as a law professor I can barely make sense of them.\"Katyal's good news is a 2022 law that made it more difficult for a Congressional member to object to a state's vote by mandating 20 percent of members in both houses sign on to the challenge, which must win a simple majority in both chambers as well.ALSO READ: People have had enough': Here are the 3 'big-picture' reasons why Kamala Harris will winThe bad news Katyal previewed in his disclaimer.\"The rules are so complicated that they could be stretched, wrongly, to give Congress the power to select the next president by sustaining bogus objections,\" he wrote. \"Don't get me wrong, such maneuvering is totally inconsistent with the 2022 law. But it can be attempted and create chaos.\"Katyal is not optimistic that certain members of Congress will put correct legal interpretation above loyalty to their party's presidential nominee.The Republican Party, according to Katyal, can no longer be trusted to hold democratic norms as sacrosanct.\"We have much to fear,\" Katyal wrote.\"It does not require much imagination to see a bad faith actor in Congress try to squeeze through bogus election fraud theories and plunge the country into uncertainty on Jan. 6,\" Katyal wrote.\"The 20 percent voting threshold is meant to avoid crackpot election fraud theories, but these days more than 20 percent of Congress might be inclined to support a crackpot theory.\"The safest bet to ensure the protectors of election integrity survive the 2024 presidential election is for Americans to vote for the candidate who has never tried to dismantle them, the law professor argued.\"If either candidate wins the Electoral College decisively,\" he concluded, \"any dispute will be rendered academic.\"",

Threat actors have created and are selling 'phishing kits', which help criminals impersonate US presidential candidates and their funding campaigns, on sale for $1260.The kits can be used to collect credit card numbers and other personal details.Over a thousand new domain names with links to the election have been created since the start of the year, sparking more concern as many of these sites are designed to mimic legitimate campaign donation sites.According to the research, the darknet has become a cesspool of cyber-activity related to the election.Social security numbers, email addresses and passwords make up some of the billions of personal details listed across darknet forums.Around 3% of posts across the darknet involve businesses and government associations in the US, only intensifying concern about account takeovers, identity theft, and other cyber-crimes.The amount of usernames and passwords generated from these organisations, amounting to 1.3 billion, increases the risk of effective credential stuffing attacks.US government agencies have continually been targeted in ransomware attacks, which saw an overall rise of 28% in 2024.If these attacks are successful and data is encrypted, they could disrupt the electoral process or damage the reputation in the system.Simple preventative measures and basic cyber hygiene can make a big difference in quelling this surge in attacks, Fortinet says.Multi-factor authentication and regular software updates, as well as endpoint protection and cybersecurity training, are important steps in keeping systems secure.",

    "content": "Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate in the 2024 Presidential Election, faced widespread ridicule following a video of him struggling to load his shotgun during a pheasant hunt.The incident, which was meant to showcase Walz as a gun-friendly candidate, backfired spectacularly, drawing mockery from conservatives and hunters alike.The video, which quickly spread across social media, shows Walz fumbling with a Beretta A400 Xcel Sporting semi-automatic shotgun (a very relatable $2000.00+ shotgun), sparking questions about his authenticity as a hunter. Although Walz has claimed to be a lifelong bird hunter, his awkward attempt to load the firearm has left many skeptical.As conservative commentator John Cardillo put it, \"Tim Walz claims that he's a lifelong bird hunter, but this clearly proves he has no idea how to load or charge a semi-automatic shotgun.\"The blunder didn't end with Walz's loading mishap. According to Fox News, despite spending three hours in the field, Walz failed to shoot a single pheasant, a detail that only fueled the mocking comments online.Walz's attempt to connect with gun owners by showing his hunting skills seemed to fall flat with the very voters he was trying to reach. The Harris campaign had hoped to leverage Walz's Midwestern roots and supposed firearm expertise to sway undecided voters in swing states, especially in the Rust Belt. However, the media debacle has instead drawn attention to Walz's past statements on gun control and his fabricated combat service record.Social media users were quick to jump on the blunder, with some likening Walz to the classic Looney Tunes character Elmer Fudd. Twitter user @delinthecity_ quipped, \"He looks like Elmer Fudd,\" while @Greg_n_Cincy sarcastically asked, \"Think he could load a paintball gun? He loves those things.\" The comments only intensified as the video gained traction. One user remarked, \"If a person buys a racing car, it doesn't mean that person can drive it,\" while others questioned Walz's overall competence with firearms.Some commenters made comparisons to Dick Cheney's hunting accident where he shot another hunter: @jackie1321_67 \"Don't go near this shotgun-fumbling knucklehead. He's about to \"Cheney\" some innocent bystander.\"Perhaps the harshest commentary came from conservative voices who questioned the judgment of the Harris campaign for allowing such a spectacle to be broadcast. As one user jokingly pointed out, \"The fact that 'the campaign' was willing to put this out shows that we have people on the inside.\"Despite the Harris campaign's efforts to appeal to gun owners by highlighting Walz's supposed gun-owning credentials, the pheasant hunting debacle has only reinforced the perception that their ticket is out of touch with Second Amendment supporters. For many, this incident was just another example of a politician attempting to pander to voters in a way that felt forced and inauthentic.",

    "title": "CHAPTER 43: Ideological Subversion, Communitarianism, and the 15-Minute City",
    "content": "Globalism is a replacement ideology that seeks to reorder the world into one singular, planetary Unistate, ruled by the globalist elite. The globalist war on nation-states cannot succeed without collapsing the United States of America. The long-term strategic attack plan moves America incrementally from constitutional republic to socialism to globalism to feudalism. The tactical attack plan uses asymmetric psychological and informational warfare to destabilize Americans and drive society out of objective reality into the madness of subjective reality. America's children are the primary target of the globalist predators.Globalists recognize neither individual nor national sovereignty. Globalism's planetary Unistate will be one-world population, one-world nation, one-world government, one-world language, one-world currency, one-world bank, one-world culture, one-world customs, one-world ethics, one-world morality, one-world norms, one-world court, one-world laws, and one-world military police enforcing one-world compliance.Marxism and globalism are both replacement ideologies. The Marxist strategy for ideological conversion relies on regressing chronological adults back to childish thinking through fear, and weaponizing education to indoctrinate children in collectivism as young as possible. The globalist strategy for world domination exploits the Marxist strategy to clear the path for the globalist Unistate.To understand what is so attractive about the state of childhood for megalomaniacs, we must return to our earlier discussion of power and control in Chapter 36, and consider the universal source of conflict between power and powerlessness that begins in childhood. It is often said that everything is political. That is true. Everything is political because everything is ideological. Everything is ideological because thoughts are ideas, and thought precedes behavior. Some ideologies support individual freedom and some support state tyranny.We are all born completely helpless and dependent upon our caretakers. An ideal childhood would have parents who love, nurture, and teach their children the skills necessary to become empowered, independent, autonomous, rational adults capable of becoming loving parents who will repeat this cycle of life. The goal is ideological, and requires family support to preserve and sustain it generationally.Adult independence, responsibility, and agency are required to support the individualism and meritocracy required for a life of ordered liberty and upward mobility in a constitutional republic. Our constitutional republic is a political structure supported by an ideological commitment to freedom and liberty, sustained by the Judeo-Christian morality that supports individualism, adulthood, and the nuclear family. These qualities are anathema to societies of rulers and ruled, because the dependence and powerlessness of early childhood are required to sustain the tyranny of binary power structures such as globalism and Marxism.In order to collapse America from within, it is necessary to subvert Americans ideologically and replace their strivings for adulthood with dependency needs. Yuri Bezmenov, a former KGB propagandist, worked as a \"journalist\" inside the Western countries he was tasked with subverting. Bezmenov defected to Canada in 1970 and began giving lectures and interviews to warn Western nations about ongoing Soviet tactics being used to subvert their countries.In his 1984 interview with G. Edward Griffin, Bezmenov explained that the main focus of the KGB was not espionage. The emphasis was on ideological subversion using covert Soviet \"active measures,\" particularly psychological warfare and disinformation. During the interview, Bezmenov defined the four stages of ideological subversion involved in a communist takeover of a Western country:Takes 15-20 years to educate one generation without any counterbalance.II. DESTABILIZATION (2-5 years)Destabilization of economy, foreign relations, and military.Creation and acceptance of the new normal. Lasts indefinitely.Bezmenov explained that the Marxist goal is to change perceptions of reality to such a degree that no one is able to come to sensible conclusions about how to defend himself, his family, or his country. It is brainwashing to the extent that facts no longer matter, and is exactly the same psychological warfare that Bertrand Russell describes in The Impact of Science on Society when he advocates weaponizing education such that children will eventually believe that snow is black. Ideological subversion and psychological warfare are the reasons why space is no longer the final frontier -- reality is.The mechanism for ideological subversion is psychological regression. I won't give the Soviets credit for understanding WHY regression works, but they definitely knew that it DOES work. And it doesn't matter how intelligent or accomplished the individual is; those qualities are completely irrelevant. I explain the mechanism of psychological regression in Dear America: Who's Driving the Bus? Fear regresses chronological adults to psychological childhood. If you frighten someone enough, you regress them back to a state of childish psychological thinking and compliance in a world of subjective reality. Children believe what they are told, no matter how factually absurd it is -- for example, the COVID fear campaign with its masking, jabs, social distancing, vaccines that are not vaccines, and endless booster shots. In talking with people regressed by active measures, you may think you are speaking to an adult, but you are actually interacting with a psychological three-year-old.Can you have a rational debate with a three-year-old? No, of course not. That is why ideological subversion is psychological warfare -- and why it is so catastrophically effective. I cannot say this often enough or strenuously enough: Freedom is an adult enterprise.Globalist social engineers are master strategists who live in objective reality and understand the infantile nature of Marxist collectivism. They know Marxist promises of equality and earthly delights historically end in tyranny, and only regressed adults ignore history, insisting that each new iteration of Marxist collectivism will be the real one.Globalists fund and foment Marxist ideological destruction to clear the path and soften America for globalist objectives. Every species of ideological Marxism, including critical race theory, Wokeism, queer theory, radical feminism, and post-colonial theory, is being used to advance the globalist war effort. The globalist coup d'état cannot succeed without collapsing America.The will to power is nothing new. What is new is the post-World War II strategy to bring down the United States ideologically, from within. Ideological Marxists continue to believe in the Culture War, its long march through American institutions, and the historical inevitability of communism. But Marxist devotees, including the leadership, are simply useful idiots being used by the globalists in their War on America. They do not recognize the transitory nature of their power to swing the cultural wrecking ball. It is the globalists, not the Marxists, who control the science and technology required to facilitate the Fourth Industrial Revolution, impose its one-world planetary Unistate, and eventually eliminate dissent and dissenters, including the Marxists.Globalist social engineers are using their coordinated narrative of fear to regress free people all over the world. If we are to remain free, we simply must remain psychological adults living in objective reality. How do we accomplish this?First, we acknowledge that we are a world at war, and we demand of ourselves that we always live in the adult world of objective reality. Fortunately, there are role models that can help us understand what this means. Author/activist Rosa Koire explained how the European Union (EU) has already accepted communitarianism. So, let's begin there.Rosa Koire (1956-2021) wrote Behind the Green Mask: U.N. Agenda 21 (2011), explaining how the foundation of Agenda 21/2030 is communitarianism. Koire was a forensic commercial real estate appraiser specializing in eminent domain valuation. She was a District Branch Chief for the California Department of Transportation and an expert witness on land use and value. In 2005 she was elected to a citizens' oversight committee to review a proposed 1,300-acre redevelopment project in Santa Rosa, Northern California, where 10,000 people lived and worked.Through her research, Koire discovered that much of the funding for UN Agenda 21/Sustainable Development land use programs came through diversion of property taxes to development agencies. Koire's book explains that Sustainable Development is an inventory and control plan for all land, water, minerals, plants, animals, construction, means of production, food, energy, information, and all human beings in the world. In other words, the planetary ecology. In 2013 she did a video interview in Denmark titled Rosa Koire: \"Agenda 21\" Open Mind Conference 2013. Six years later the same interview was reposted and retitled Rosa Koire: UN Agenda 2030 exposed. Much of Rosa Koire's work has already been deleted from the internet. Her 2013 interview exposed the catastrophic impact of Sustainable Development on private property rights and liberty. Its relevance today is chilling. The interview is preserved in its entirety below.I'm Rosa Koire and I'm from the United States, California, and my topic, what I speak about is one of the most vitally important issues of our age and that is the United Nations Agenda 21 Sustainable Development. And as I'll be talking about tomorrow, it is the inventory and control plan. Inventory and control of all land, all water, all minerals, all plants, all animals, all construction, all means of production, all food, all energy, all information, and all human beings in the world. And this is a plan that was agreed to by a hundred and seventy-nine nations back in 1992.It's a United Nations plan, it's called the \"Agenda for the 21st century,\" and so many of us around the world think that sustainable development, it just sounds so great. Isn't it about recycling and creative reuse and creating energy and food resources for everyone? And the answer is No. It really is not. It's about moving populations into city centers, concentrated city centers, and clearing them out of the rural areas. So, I became, I found out about it in a very unusual way actually, because I spent my career as a legal witness, as an expert witness for the California Department of Transportation. I'm an expert in land use and land valuation, and my specialty is in eminent domain valuation. Of course, I was valuing property for the government so that the government could acquire that property for road projects, and what I found about ten years ago, by around or 10 or 15 years ago, was that land actually, it was very difficult to say what it was worth because you couldn't know what people could do with it, because they were being restricted from using their property. And as I explored that, and found that it wasn't just in the San Francisco Bay Area where I was working, it was in fact all across the nation and the world. I looked behind that and I found United Nations Agenda 21 Sustainable Development.We created the Post Sustainability Institute in order to educate people about the economic, social, political, and environmental impacts of communitarianism on the world. And communitarianism is that concept, that social and political construct that says that the individual's rights should be balanced against the rights of the community. And, of course, the community is that amorphous undefined community that we, you know when we talk about community, we think we're of course part of it and that, you know, it's a positive thing. But really community is, constructed, it's constructed of non-governmental organizations, corporations, and government, in order to dictate and regulate what it is that happens around the world. And we as individuals have literally no influence on that unless we are in agreement with it. If you dissent against the community, against communitarian law or against communitarian social tactics, you're rejected and basically made an outcast. And that is something that that we wanted to expose to the world and the reason that we created a Post Sustainability Institute was in order to sue.We sued our local government and right now we're suing a higher-up in order to stop regional plans because regionalization is the stepping-stone to globalization, and globalization is the standardization of all systems. So, that includes water, law enforcement, education, energy, all systems have to be brought into harmony in order to control them all. Because when systems don't meet, when they're out of balance or not synced with one another, they can't be controlled centrally. And the goal of Agenda 21 is one-world government and total control from a central unit.America, the United States of America, is really under attack right now. We in the United States are, well, the U.S. landmass is about two and a half times the size of Europe and has roughly half the population. Just over half that landmass is huge and about 75% of the population lives in large cities. The goal is to move everyone out of the rural areas and into the large cities, and to destroy representative government, and to move it into to a government by unelected boards and commissions.Now here in the EU of course you have, you know, you've already moved to that position, where it's an erasure of jurisdictional boundaries an erasure of national boundaries, and that is the goal because as Zbigniew Brzezinski said in 1995, you can't just impose globalization pell-mell as a total movement, you have to do it incrementally. And the way to do that is through regionalization. And in Denmark, for instance in Denmark, well, every nation that signed on to Agenda 21 has its local Agenda 21 plan. People in the United States are completely unaware of this. If I go out and talk about this the United States, press attacks me and calls me a conspiracy theorist, which is totally ridiculous. It is a conspiracy, but it's not a theory. It's a fact. Here in Europe, it's openly spoken about, local Agenda 21. And, of course, here in Denmark the Aalborg Principles 2000 excuse me, 1994, and then Aalborg +10, 2004, was the European roundtable for local Agenda 21, was held here. And the Principles are public-private partnerships, which is fascism, and this is how it's implemented on the ground. Is through this joining together between corporations, non-governmental organizations, and governments in order to cut out the, you know, the actual individual, your voter. And instead to take that to a level where we literally cannot penetrate, and this is the goal. So, this is already far progressed in Europe.The three pillars of United Nations Agenda 21 are Economy, Ecology, and Equity. The three E's -- the social equity -- and everyone sort of thinks that they know what that means. The idea of social equity must mean that, well, everyone's going to have access to clean water and clean air, and no one's property is going to be used as a dumping ground because they are at a poverty level.But really, what social equity is about, it's about impoverishing huge portions of the population and bringing down the developed nations. And while this sounds like, you know, it sounds almost like in the United States, you'd call that a right-wing point of view, a conservative right-wing point of view. I personally am a liberal. The idea that something this drastic, this radical, would be happening worldwide without people knowing it. All you have to do is look at austerity measures; restrictions on transfers of wealth; additional restrictions on land use; ability, you know, to produce, to use your energy, your water, your industry; all of this is happening in developed nations. So, when you have your infrastructure attacked like that, it's going to have a tremendous impact on your ability to prosper. As well as the idea that everything that we're looking at now is destined to collapse our economies. Because the idea, this is a corporatocracy, it's a totalitarian state being developed right now all over the world.And what major corporations want in this fascist development is to be able to have full movement of workers without borders or boundaries. To be able to move their goods through without regulations and to reduce wages. And so, this is the goal, this is what you find with social equity, that's code for social equity, for this movement and reduction of the population. And of course the economy and ecology is about bringing into balance economy, these are the three circles, Economy, Ecology, and social Equity. And where they meet in the center is balance.But really that balance is a communitarian balance. So, it's not balance of well-being of the people, what it is is it's a balance or corporation so that they can exploit and control and have populations in an area in tightly packed dense areas so that they can be surveilled and managed. And this is what that balance looks like as far as the development of totalitarian state.I think it's very important to know that the people now still have an opportunity to fight. All of us across the world understand that our individuality is at stake here. Our most important private property is our body, and of course surveillance is a vital part, surveillance, domestic surveillance and control, is a vital part of this plan. It is a totalitarian plan. But you know, just like any other extreme plan, while we are moving towards the endgame, we are not there. And this is the opportunity that all of us have now to stand up, to speak out, to refuse to collaborate, to refuse to cooperate. To expose collaborators, to work together to defund these plans. To refuse, to demand what it is the corporations want to give us and so, because no one's holding a gun to our heads right now, we have that opportunity.If that changes, if that moment changes, you certainly won't protest then, so now is the time. And people all over the world are doing this. It's that the mainstream media is owned by five major corporations, and you're not going to get this information from the mainstream press. So, you need to be your own press. You need to educate yourself. You need to get out there and educate your neighbors, your community, your real community. You need to help your children understand that they're being indoctrinated from pre-kindergarten to postgraduate school.All of us have a responsibility to ourselves and to others. This is true community, to work for personal freedom and always remember that even though we work as a group, if we do work as a group, we're all individuals in those groups and we answer only to ourselves. And this is essential, it's essential as free human beings. This is what we are -- we are free and we need to continue to be free. And I do believe that we will win, but we have to become aware that there is a fight, and then make our friends and our neighbors and our community aware as well, and work together.Right now, in the United States we are moving into major massive regionalization. The United States has 50 states, and it's divided into cities, counties, and states, and then the federal government. Instead, Agenda 21 is top-down. It's global, regional, neighborhood, and none of those positions is elected. So, in the United States right now, the development of regionalization is happening very quickly. It's happening with federal funding. There are hundreds of millions of dollars going to local governments in order to have them create regional plans. And this plan cannot be accomplished without control of land and land use, because of course where you live often dictates the kind of life you're going to have.So, regionalization takes away our opportunity to have an impact. It takes away representative government. So, what we are doing at the Post Sustainability Institute right now is we are suing to stop the biggest regional plan in the United States, and it is a blueprint for the rest of the country. What this plan is doing is essentially saying that no new development will happen anywhere. But in 4% of the San Francisco Bay Area that all 101 cities and nine counties will be joined together and all land-use decisions will be made basically by an unelected Board. What this will do to land use and land value in the San Francisco Bay Area, to movements of people, to development of business, to freedom, is unfathomable. And people are not aware of it. The only thing that is standing between that and full passage is our lawsuit.Now what this truly means is if you tell people that they have to build only \"smart\" growth, high-density development in an urban center right on a train line. Or, the train doesn't have to be there, it's the proposed idea of a train line, and then no development, no buildings, no residential, no commercial, can happen outside of that very, very concentrated area, then what do you have? You have a concentration camp of the future.This is exactly what it looks like and you see it's very much more subtle and much more sophisticated than it was when the Nazis were doing it. You are not going to get thrown on a train car, you will just have your roads out in the rural areas pulverized and turned to gravel. You'll have your family well monitored, you will have your energy restricted, you will have your school service cut, your Sheriff service cut. You will find that you are not able to get your goods to market, and then you have to move into the city, and then you will move into this high-density development that is subsidized with our property tax dollars, and pretty soon you will have the Wildlands Project, which is predicated on moving people out of the rural areas.This is how it happens, so you know people say, \"Well, hey, nobody's getting me off my land.\" Well, it's very easy. You know, no one's going to come to your door with a gun, but they will move you off your land. And you will be in the cities and those cities will be full capability of surveillance, monitoring, and control. These buildings, these high-density buildings, are being built with a concept of eyes on the street. You become basically a deputized police adjunct. Your job is to watch the street. Your job is to watch your neighbor.The war on terror is a war on you, and we all know this. We feel it. This is why we need to stop it. So, this is our plan, to use the courts at this point and stop this plan. And we're working on it.Koire's plan was to make people aware, and to use the courts to stop the plan. She understood that land use is the institutional path to high-density developments and surveillance modeled after China's system: physically (forcefully if necessary) moving the population to 15-minute city centers where they will be surveilled and controlled.Land use is parallel to political medicine. Both weaponize institutional power to increase social control by the state. Life in the Unistate is the beginning of Humanity 2.0, where all living things are part of the planetary ecology of communitarianism and Scientism's evolutionary ascendancy to transhumanism. Science and technology made Brzezinski's 1970 predictions come true, and science and technology are being used to make globalist megalomaniacal dreams of technocracy and transhumanism come true. Cognitive warfare will make life in the Unistate an existence of totalitarian conformity, serfdom, and compliance with the orthodoxy of Scientism.Member of the European Parliament Christine Anderson is an unyielding opponent of globalism and Klaus Schwab's Great Reset agenda. She is one of the few remaining politicians actually representing the interests of the people. In a September 13, 2023, session devoted to COVID-19 response and the World Health Organization, she ended the meeting with this powerful statement posted verbatim on Vigilant News, with emphasis added.We just need to find a way to wake the people up. Because the point is simply this: it comes down to a choice. It's either freedom, democracy, and the rule of law -- or enslavement.There is no such thing  in between. There is no such thing as a little freedom, a little democracy, a little rule of law, just as there is no such thing as a little enslavement. So that's the choice. It comes down to -- it's either the globalitarian misanthropists or the people. It comes down to -- it's either us or them. And that's, I think, what this really is all about.Now, when my colleagues and I were elected to this parliament, there was no question about it: we were on the side of the people because the people actually pay us to act in their best interests. That's our job. And once again, I will say to every single elected representative around the world, to every single member in every elected government around the world, if you do not unequivocally stand with the people and serve in their best interests, act in their best interests, you have no place in any parliament or in any government. You belong behind bars. You may even rot in hell for all I care at this point because that's exactly what you deserve if you sell out the people.Now, I would like to make a promise to the people, and I'm pretty sure I can speak  or speak on behalf of my colleagues. We will continue to stand with you, the people. We will continue to fight for freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. We will not shut up, and we will not stop going after those despicable globalitarian misanthropists.But we would also like to have you make a promise to us. You may have heard it's all coming back. The first country is already starting mask mandates in Israel. They're already imposing it. I've heard of a few universities in the United States. They're already bringing it all back. And I would really like for you, the people, to not go along. Simply say no! They want you to wear a mask: say no. They want you to put in another mRNA shot: say no. They want to impose a curfew on you: say no. That's really all you have to do.And it might not be or might sound a little hard, but it's actually not that hard. Because once you have made it clear to them that you will no longer go along, once you've let them know, they cannot scare you anymore. Because as long as you are afraid of what they might do if you don't comply, they have power over you. Take the power away from them! Simply say no. Once you do that, they don't have power over you anymore. You will feel so free. Simply say no.And considering what we've heard today, and considering what we've seen in the last three years, considering what we know they want to implement, heck, you might even be well within your right to tell them to screw themselves and go to hell! That's where they belong. What will you get out of that? I can tell you. Once you've done that, once you've told them to just go to hell, they no longer have power over you. You will have an incredible feeling -- kind of like a sensation of freedom will sweep through your body. I promise you will feel so relieved.And this is the state of mind that I would ask all of you to get to. Simply don't let them grind you down anymore. You are worth it. You are deserving of just standing up for yourselves. And tell them all to go to hell. Thank you very much.Christine Anderson is an MEP for Germany's anti-immigration party, Alternative for Germany (AfD), and an outspoken critic of Canada's Justin Trudeau. In March 2022 she accused Trudeau of openly admiring the Chinese dictatorship, and criticized him for trampling on \"fundamental rights by persecuting and criminalizing his own citizens as terrorists just because they dare to stand up to his perverted concept of democracy.\"Anderson speaks on the international stage, but to resist globalism we must stand against it locally. On September 20, 2023, Canadian citizen Joel Sussman stood before the Aurora, Ontario, City Council and schooled them on globalism and its existential threat to freedom. Joel Sussman's videotaped statement below:Good evening. Restructuring of Canadian mayors and municipalities under the auspices of the United Nations began in 1992. PM Mulroney signed Canada onto UN Agenda 21. Canada thus became a UN member nation-state. One hundred seventy-eight  countries signed on, lured by the promise of big money to go green. By 2000, countries, including Canada, were being governed by directions of the UN, G7, G20, World Economic Forum, and World Health Organization, to name some.Every organization named is a foreign-based NGO, non-governmental organization, and every member of all these organizations is unelected. Parliamentary procedures for law changes weren't followed. In 1994, a municipal primer was issued to all local towns, outlining how they were to restructure their governments.Though the municipal primer was a non-binding agreement, all towns adopted it. Our public officials, the mayor and councilors of that day, were partnered with a private corporation, the Corporation of the Town of Aurora, who appointed a chief administrative officer who helped implement the global agenda instead of a local one.The International Council on Local and Environmental Issues, ICLEI, became the main source of consultation to push and fund the global agenda. We remind you that the World Economic Forum and the United Nations signed a strategic partnership framework in 2019 to jointly accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.This is the same World Economic Forum whose chairman, Klaus Schwab, famously declared \"you will own nothing and be happy.\" This is the same Klaus Schwab who, referring to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, boasted, \"We have penetrated more than half of his cabinet.\" We would ask Mayor Maracas and the Councilors: Why should the citizens of Aurora bow down to the intrusive dictates of an unelected foreign entity?The fact is we should not. And we will not. What, you ask, does any of this have to do with 15-minute smart cities? Absolutely everything. Smart: S for surveillance, M for monitoring, A for analysis, R for reporting, and T for technology. Technocracy News editor Patrick Wood, 50 years of experience and expertise on technocracy, wrote, \"The 15-minute city is a cover for  data collection bonanza for technocrats who design and operate them.\"Cities designed for maximum efficiency always reveal technocrat thinking that efficiency itself is the goal. Maximum surveillance allows for maximum control to achieve even more efficiency. At its very root, this mechanistic thinking is anti-human. The 15-minute city narrative seeks to fool you in the guise of saving the planet, keeping you safe, and delivering convenience.It's actually the gateway to digital IDs and CBDC, Central Bank Digital Currencies. CBDCs allow bankers and/or governments to freeze your bank account because you happen to peacefully and lawfully protest and express your disagreement with government policy. Does anyone remember the truckers' convoy in Ottawa, February 22,  when the government of Canada invoked the Emergencies Act and froze the private bank accounts of law-abiding citizens?Fifteen-minute cities are wolves in sheep's clothing. Don't believe the countless stories spewing forth from the 24/7 bases, from the elitist-captured mainstream media, all claiming to have your best interests at heart. We have been burned too many times. In reality, 24/7 surveillance through the Internet of Things inside your home, 5G, and LED streetlights outside, monitoring and tracking and recording everything. Implementation of exclusion zones and geofencing to restrict movement and travel. Ability to control behaviors through military-directed energy technologies, property and car ownership to be outlawed, evictions from farms and rural areas to go to gather people into cities. Digital passports being promulgated by the UN World Economic Forum and the World Health Organization are in the final stages of planning and implementation. They are tied to social credit score, which is determined by compliance to government directives. These passports control all access and all aspects of life. Digital currency is being implemented to end cash and monitor all your spending. Your digital currency will be turned off or on depending on your compliance score. UBI, Universal Basic Income, is a state-controlled allowance forcing compliance by restricting access to food, money, services, and education.All of the above will enable climate lockdowns to be implemented easily, arbitrarily, and indefinitely.The real agenda of 15-Minute Smart Cities is to monitor and control everyone and everything. In summary, in the coming days, Council will receive an electronic info packet which will contain the text of this delegation and other items. We, the citizens of Aurora, wish to enter into a meaningful, respectful dialogue with our elected members of Council on this complex, important issue.A key framework of that dialogue is a list of questions posed to Council. Can Council explicitly guarantee that citizens will remain free to travel as is their right under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms? Can Council guarantee not to restrict access to essential services, medical care, bank accounts, government pensions, utilities?Most importantly, we the citizens of Aurora need to have the conversation with the Council about exiting their non-binding agreement with the private for-profit entity known as the Corporation of the Town of Aurora. We need to turn back the page to a simpler time when open, transparent municipal government serving its citizens and working in their best interests ruled the day.We are your equal partners on this journey. Thank you.Joel Sussman received an enthusiastic one-minute standing ovation from the gallery.For me, the most disturbing aspect of Sussman's speech was the City Council's response. The Aurora, Ontario, city councilors entrusted with public policy politely thanked Sussman for sharing his views, but appeared completely unaware of the history, government restructuring, public-private partnerships, and global agenda they were actively participating in against the public interest.This is an information war. City councilors who rely solely on information from globalist sources are participating, wittingly or unwittingly, in the globalist war on humanity. What is happening in Aurora, Ontario, is happening elsewhere. Citizens must take the responsibility and initiative, as Joel Sussman did, to provide facts challenging the globalist narrative that city officials are blithely and naively accepting.Joel Sussman is a role model for freedom-loving citizens. Here in the United States, citizens in every state, in every county, and in every city should attend city council meetings and read Joel Sussman's transcript out loud into the public record.Resistance requires accurate information and the courage to stand against the herd. Stopping the globalist advance requires being a psychological adult, living in the adult world of objective reality based on facts. Activist Rosa Koire, MEP Christine Anderson, and Citizen Joel Sussman possess the courage of their convictions, and have provided us all with demonstrations of what that courage looks like. Now it is up to us.America's freedom clock is ticking, and the globalist social engineers are in the final stages of their war on humanity. The next fear campaign is coming. It will probably be another bioweapon release, marketed as a worldwide pandemic far more contagious than COVID-19. It will be exploited politically as a catastrophic event necessitating the exclusive use of mail-in ballots in the 2024 presidential election -- for public health, of course. Anyone who objects will be accused of voter suppression. If not a bioweapon, then I predict the globalists will incite social chaos with some outrageous action or policy that ends with fighting in the streets. The goal is to make society totally ungovernable. Then the globalists will declare martial law -- for public safety, of course.After martial law comes feudal serfdom in globalism's planetary managerial Unistate -- a scientific dictatorship ruled by the elite, who always and only take care of themselves.

    "content": "Two recent movies about former U.S. presidents have had significantly different starts at the box office.The Apprentice took $482,803 per day on average during its first four days, earning a high of $590,628 on its opening day and $317,980 on its fourth -- the latest daily figure available -- on October 14.Reagan took $2.58 million per day on average during its first four days, raking in $2.7 million on its opening day and $2.65 million three days later on Labor Day.Reagan has appeared in more theaters. At its peak it was screened at 2,770 venues compared to 1,740 cinemas so far showing The Apprentice.The Reagan biopic was universally panned by critics, being dubbed \"the worst kind of hagiography\" in The Boston Globe and \"the worst movie of the year\" on The Daily Beast website.Yet the movie appeared to go down well with audiences, defying box office expectations and earning a 98 percent score among verified audience reviewers on movie-rating site Rotten Tomatoes at time of publication.Reagan was independently financed, with a grassroots marketing campaign which paled in comparison to some advertising budgets for Hollywood movies. Directed by Sean McNamara, it was loosely based on The Crusader: Ronald Reagan and the Fall of Communism, a 2006 book written by Paul Kengor.The Apprentice was made with a $16 million budget and tells a version of Trump's life in New York in the 1970s and 1980s, focusing on his relationships with his lawyer Roy Cohn and his first wife, Ivana Trump.The movie stars Sebastian Stan as Trump, Jeremy Strong as Cohn and Maria Bakalova as Ivana Trump.The Trump biopic also faced a huge challenge to be released in theaters, after struggling to find a distributor after it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in France in May. Director Ali Abbasi described making the movie and then getting it released as the \"most challenging thing I've ever done.\"\"When we were at  Cannes and we got a standing ovation and everyone was so happy and flattering, I was thinking there was going to be a bidding war, do I want to go with Warner or Netflix, who do I want to pick?\" he told the BBC, adding that \"it was extremely difficult for us to get a distributor,\" which he believed was because Trump threatened legal action.Trump criticized the movie on his social media platform Truth Social before it premiered.\"A FAKE and CLASSLESS Movie written about me, called, The Apprentice (Do they even have the right to use that name without approval?), will hopefully 'bomb,\" the Republican presidential candidate in November's election wrote.\"It's a cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country, 'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!'\"",

    "title": "Border Agents Seize $11 Million Worth of Blue Fentanyl Pills",
    "content": "Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents uncovered a massive drug haul of blue fentanyl pills that may be worth more than $11 million stashed in a vehicle in California.Officers discovered 122 pounds of narcotics concealed within the vehicle's quarter panel during a routine inspection at the Calexico West Port of Entry on Oct. 9, the agency said in a statement dated yesterday.The estimated street value of the drugs is thought to be about $11 million based on a previous 123.6-pound discovery of blue fentanyl pills in March. Newsweek contacted the CBP to confirm the estimated value of the drugs.During the initial inspection, which involved a CBP K-9 sniffer dog unit, officers discovered the packages and referred the driver and the vehicle for further examination. A 47-year-old man was then taken into custody, suspected of attempting to smuggle the drugs into the United States from Mexico.CBP officers uncovered a total of 98 packages concealed within the vehicle's quarter panels and back headrest. The substance tested positive for fentanyl, according to CBP.Homeland Security Investigations has launched a full investigation into the matter, and inquiries remain ongoing.\"This fentanyl pill seizure is a big win in our fight against the opioid crisis,\" Roque Caza, area port director of Calexico, said in the statement. \"Every pill off the streets is a life potentially saved. I commend our hardworking CBP officers and law enforcement partners for keeping our communities safe.\"The latest drug bust is part of ongoing CBP efforts to intercept and prevent the trafficking of illicit narcotics into the country.Terri Beth Miller, senior editor at Rehab.com, told Newsweek that the CBP \"urgently\" needs more personnel to deal with the \"surge\" of drugs flowing through the southern border.\"Fentanyl is infiltrating communities across the U.S. No city, state, or region is immune. However, the overwhelming majority of fentanyl seizures, more than 95%, occur at the southwestern border of the U.S.\"Though illegal border crossings are often blamed for the surge of fentanyl into the US, the reality is that fentanyl is most commonly smuggled into the U.S. through legal ports of entry.\"This speaks to the urgent need for more DEA, Customs and Border Patrol resources at the southern border. A surge of law enforcement personnel, border agents and drug interdiction technologies is desperately needed.\"Immigration and border security are key issues in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election, as both Republicans and Democrats want to see curbs on migration.According to a poll by Gallup, 55 percent of respondents who back Donald Trump's calls for curbs wanted to see immigration levels decrease.A slight majority of respondents back Trump's flagship border wall policy from 2016, as 53% support significantly expanding the construction of walls along the U.S.-Mexico border, up 13 points since 2019.In an Economist/YouGov poll conducted in August, former president Trump led Vice President Kamala Harris by 51 points among adults who said immigration was \"very important\" to them -- with 83 percent saying they planned to back Trump compared to 32 percent who said they would vote for Harris.Polling by Redfield and Wilton Strategies shows that 47 percent of respondents trust Trump on immigration compared to 36 percent who trust Harris. That is a gap that has been closing in recent weeks, as border crossings have fallen sharply in the aftermath of President Joe Biden's executive order limiting asylum claims.",

    "content": "Former President Donald Trump's odds of winning the presidency in November soared to a 16-point lead over his Democratic opponent Kamala Harris on the leading prediction website Polymarket this week.As of Tuesday afternoon, the site gave Trump a 58% chance of winning the 2024 presidential election in three weeks, compared to a 42% chance for Harris. The spike represents the Republican's biggest lead on the site since July 31.Harris sits at her lowest Polymarket odds since the Democratic National Committee (DNC) controversially declared her as the party's nominee in early August.Polymarket indicated Tuesday that there is a 26% chance Trump will sweep all seven battleground states on November 5 - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.Click here to \nThe site also gave Trump a 16% chance of winning all but one of those swing states.At the time, Polymarket listed Trump's odds of carrying Arizona at 68%, Georgia at 64%, North Carolina at 63%, Pennsylvania at 56%, Michigan at 54%, and Wisconsin at 53%.Nevada was the only swing state where Polymarket gave Harris an advantage, albeit a razor-thin one of 51% to Trump's 50%.However, even if Trump loses Nevada to Harris, he would still win the election with 306 electoral votes if he gains the support of all the states in which Polymarket currently shows he is leading.One week ago, Polymarket had given Trump a smaller 52.6% chance of winning the 2024 election compared to Harris' 46.7% chance.As CatholicVote noted last week, before Monday, October 7, \"Harris was considered by the site's odds to be the slight favorite to win the election since September 12 - two days after the sole debate between her and Trump.\"On Tuesday of last week, Polymarket gave Harris a slight 53% advantage in the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Trump now enjoys roughly the same advantage in both states, according to Polymarket.On Monday morning, political commentator Collin Rugg wrote on X (formerly Twitter): \"Bettors are becoming increasingly confident Trump will win the election as he surges to nearly a double-digit lead.\"Trump's eight-point Polymarket lead then doubled within a day.\"The development comes as a new NBC News poll shows Trump pulling even with Kamala Harris after being behind by 5 points in their poll last month,\" Rugg pointed out.CatholicVote previously reported that Polymarket \"brands itself as 'the world's largest prediction market.'\"\"Via one of its web pages, it states that its markets 'seek truth' and 'reflect accurate, unbiased, real-time probabilities for events that matter most to you,'\" CatholicVote indicated.",

    "title": "'God gives us guidance in who to elect' in Exodus: NHCLC speaker",
    "content": "WASHINGTON -- Several Christian leaders are encouraging the Latino Evangelical community to fully participate in the 2024 presidential election, contending that they have a mandate from God to help ensure the election of leaders who support biblical values.The National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, which represents thousands of churches throughout the United States and the Spanish-speaking world, hosted its 2024 Latino Evangelical Leadership Summit at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C. Tuesday. The annual gathering, which hundreds of people attended, took place three weeks before the 2024 presidential election this year.Several of the speakers encouraged members of the audience to take a direct role in the upcoming election. \"God gives us guidance in who to elect,\" said Debbie Wuthrow of iVoterGuide. She cited Exodus 18:21, which instructs people to \"select capable men from all the people -- men who fear God, trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain -- and appoint them as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens\" as the biblical guidance she was referring to.Wuthrow identified iVoterGuide as a tool created by God \"to equip you to identify those candidates at all  of office.\" She outlined its key feature, \"an election resource in all 50 states\" where \"you and your congregation enter your address\" and get a personalized ballot and that includes candidates ranging from \"president down to school board with an evaluation of where they land politically.\"Wuthrow stressed that while information about federal candidates is available for all 50 states, 32 states have facts about state legislative candidates and 12 have profiles of \"select school board candidates.\" She plugged iVoterGuide as \"a free tool for the church\" that has information about \"13,000 candidates.\"Another one of the speakers, Mary Thomas, works with the Job Creators Network, an organization that partners with the NHCLC. She told the audience that \"the Latino Christian community\" has \"the power to determine the outcome of this election.\"Thomas insisted that the Latino Christian community \"must get our families, our friends, our churches out to vote\" in support of \"biblical values.\" She maintained that the election amounted to a choice between \"leaders who support freedom and biblical values\" or \"leaders who will continue to attack the principles that we believe in.\"Thomas also highlighted several of the issues she thought Christian voters should keep in the back of their minds on Election Day, specifically lamenting that \"children being taught things that are against our biblical values in schools\" such as the idea \"that boys can be girls instead of being taught how to read, write and do math.\"Thomas also expressed outrage about \"our daughters being attacked in bathrooms\" by trans-identified men and \"elected leaders who push the murder of innocent babies even after they are born,\" referring to politicians who oppose providing life-saving care to babies who survive botched abortions.\"Our elected leaders who are determining the laws and the future of our nation do not reflect our values,\" she proclaimed. \"But we as people of strong faith know that in the end, the kingdom of God will always prevail. And we know that we must now take action to defend our faith and our biblical values.\"Thomas maintained that \"we must let our Father speak through us to save our nation.\" She reiterated that \"With God's guidance and strength, God has given us the power to determine the future of this nation, to return it to what it used to be and what it must be: One nation under God.\"\"These last 21 days, we need all of you to step up and please speak to your church members, your communities, your friends and your families,\" she added.The Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, NHCLC president, invited the Rev. Johnnie Moore to offer a prayer for \"this election and for the sovereignty of God\" and that \"every Latino Christian will vote.\" Moore currently leads the Congress of Christian Leaders, an organization established to unify Christian movements worldwide, and previously served as a commissioner on the U.S. Commission for International Religious Freedom.\"What a travesty it would be for us to have inherited so much and to pass down so little to the next generation,\" Moore remarked. \"We entrust the future of our nation to you.\"Highlighting the role of the U.S. as a beacon of religious liberty for those around the world, Moore stressed the obligation to \"keep the light held high\" and \"to defend our own religious freedom\" to ensure that persecuted Christians around the world \"have any hope of it whatsoever.\"Moore told God \"We are asking you to intervene in every way for the good of our country.\" Moore pushed back on the idea that the Evangelical community wants a \"weird theocracy,\" asserting that \"We just want to be left alone to preach the Gospel to the ends of the earth.\"The pleas from Christian leaders urging Latino Christians to make their voices heard in the 2024 presidential election come amid concerns that many faith-based voters are planning on abstaining from voting in it. A recently released report from the Cultural Research Center at Arizona Christian University estimates that 32 million self-identified Christians who regularly attend church services are slated to sit out the election.",

Waters, 86, spoke about her expectations leading up to the 2024 Presidential Election during an interview with TMZ on Monday.The U.S. representative for California's 43rd congressional district told the news outlet that though polling shows Harris and her main rival Donald Trump are tied, she explained that \"the national poll\" provides a better insight about which candidate is ahead.\"You can't always count on , but I think the campaign with the great get-out-the-vote  is gonna win -- and that's gonna be Harris-Walz,\" she stated.Asked if she was nervous about the election, Waters said that was not the case. She urged people who were feeling nervous to make sure they have a say in who leads the country.\"I don't think you have to be nervous, you have to do something,\" Waters said. \"You have to be involved. If you are involved in any way that you can then you're not nervous, you're more confident.\"READ ALSO: Texas man who threatened Rep.

If Vice President Harris, 59, defeats Trump in November, she would not only be the first woman to serve as president but also the first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to be president thanks to her roots.Harris has already achieved a lot of firsts in her more than two decades in public life. Her feats include being the first Black woman to serve as San Francisco's district attorney, the first woman to be California's attorney general, the first Indian American senator, and the first woman vice president of the U.S.Following her confirmation as the Democratic Party's presidential nominee, several celebrities and public figures have thrown their support behind her candidacy.

    "title": "How the CIA's dirty tricks shape US elections  --  and you",
    "content": "In my new book, \"Twilight of the Shadow Government: How Transparency Will Kill the Deep State,\" I describe in detail how the Central Intelligence Agency manipulates the U.S. government and its military-industrial complex contract corporations. The CIA attempts to influence not only foreign government elections but U.S. elections as well -- a deeply disturbing aspect of what I call the shadow government, aka the deep state.This pattern dates to the administration of John F. Kennedy. During Kennedy's presidency, the CIA conducted covert operations without his knowledge. Furious, JFK fired rogue CIA Director Allen Dulles, who held a deep grudge against him. It surprised no one in Congress when, after Kennedy's assassination, Dulles was put in charge of the Warren Commission, which investigated the president's murder. Dulles handpicked and coached all CIA witnesses who testified before the committee.The CIA is manipulating a presidential election, right in front of the American people -- again.The CIA also played a direct role in the rise of former President Bill Clinton. As governor of Arkansas, Clinton entered into a secret agreement with then-Vice President George H.W. Bush -- another notorious CIA figure -- to use the Mena, Arkansas, airport to run guns and drugs to and from the Nicaraguan Contras.I was a CIA officer during that time. The CIA was under investigation for committing felonies behind Congress' back (and, of course, behind the backs of the American people). I have no doubt that the CIA gave then-Gov. Clinton a CIA clearance, bringing him into direct contact with \"the Company.\"Despite supposedly being political enemies, Bush and Clinton maintained a close relationship until Bush's death in 2018. From my perspective, Clinton's direct connection to the CIA helped him rise from relative obscurity to the presidency, making him yet another useful president for the CIA.George H.W. Bush had a decades-long affiliation with the CIA, which he tried to downplay by claiming he only worked with the agency during his brief tenure as director in the mid-1970s. In reality, Bush was a CIA officer as far back as 1953, when he partnered with CIA officer Thomas Devine to form Zapata Petroleum, working under commercial cover. Their oil wells were located just 40 miles from Cuba.One of Bush's tasks as director was to manage the fallout from the CIA's Operation Mockingbird. During a news conference, Bush stated that the CIA would no longer recruit American journalists to be on the agency's payroll. What many missed, however, was his follow-up comment: From now on, reporters and the news media could work with the CIA on a voluntary basis. The CIA has a unique way of turning \"voluntary\" into a requirement, establishing a quid pro quo with major media companies. This arrangement prevented outlets from publishing exposés on CIA activities while providing them with intelligence-derived information to manipulate public opinion.When Bush became vice president in 1981, it essentially placed the CIA in the second-highest seat of the U.S. government. I am convinced that Bush was the agency's mastermind behind the criminal Iran-Contra operation, once again manipulating a president to engage in illegal covert activities.Under President Barack Obama, the CIA implemented a drone assassination program that targeted at least eight wedding parties, killing innocent civilians. The CIA convinced Obama to maintain a kill list of foreigners it considered dangerous, often based on unproven suspicions. In effect, Obama allowed the CIA to act as judge, jury, and executioner.Obama arrested and jailed more intelligence whistleblowers than any previous president, using the outdated Espionage Act. The most notable of these was former CIA case officer John Kiriakou, a top performer in the CIA Counterterrorism Center, who was imprisoned on frivolous charges.During the Obama administration, notorious CIA Director John Brennan made several covert trips to Ukraine to underwrite the 2014 coup, which resulted in the Russia-Ukraine war and the ensuing proxy war between the United States and Russia, bringing America to the brink of World War III.While Donald Trump was president, the CIA launched a full-scale operation to remove him from office for daring to question the agency. Brennan initiated the Russia collusion hoax by leaking the \"Steele dossier,\" a complete fabrication based on false information from Russian intelligence officials. Brennan misled the press, claiming the dossier was CIA intelligence. I have provided an in-depth analysis of this CIA operation on YouTube (@kevinshipp1). This was the CIA's attempt to stage a domestic coup and take down a sitting president. Although the plot failed, no CIA or FBI official faced accountability for their crimes.After Joe Biden's victory, evidence surfaced of Biden's involvement in Ukraine following the 2014 CIA-orchestrated coup. This led to the discovery of Hunter Biden's laptop, which contained salacious videos, along with evidence of sex, drugs, and guns. To protect Biden, 51 former intelligence officials, including 42 senior CIA officers, quickly signed a public statement claiming the laptop story was \"Russian disinformation.\" That was a lie. We must remember that the CIA's core functions include lying, deception, and propaganda, especially when protecting its own existence.We now know the CIA convinced Facebook and Twitter executives to promote Biden for president and censor posts supporting Trump. The cover for the operation? Posts and articles supporting Donald Trump were \"Russian disinformation.\" Russia is always the CIA's boogeyman.This brings us to the upcoming 2024 presidential election. I am an independent, and I am not endorsing either party. My goal is to remain objective and unbiased. The CIA is up to its dirty tricks again, attempting to sway public opinion in the direction of the agency's chosen candidate, Kamala Harris. All 42 of the aforementioned senior CIA officers (the most notorious being Mike Morrell, who attempted to sway the 2016 presidential election in Hillary Clinton's favor) have issued a statement supporting Kamala Harris for president and attacking Trump. That's along with 741 \"national security leaders\" who have endorsed Harris.The CIA is manipulating a presidential election, right in front of the American people -- again.",

MSNBC's net negative is lower, at 4%, with 40% holding a favorable view and 44% holding an unfavorable view.Those net negative margins increase among independent voters, with a 10% net negative for CNN and 9% for MSNBC among the key demographic. Even among college-educated voters, the perception still leans negative; CNN has a 3% net negative margin among this group, while MSNBC's is just 2%.

The CIA was under investigation for committing felonies behind Congress' back (and, of course, behind the backs of the American people). I have no doubt that the CIA gave then-Gov. Clinton a CIA clearance, bringing him into direct contact with \"the Company.\"Despite supposedly being political enemies, Bush and Clinton maintained a close relationship until Bush's death in 2018. From my perspective, Clinton's direct connection to the CIA helped him rise from relative obscurity to the presidency, making him yet another useful president for the CIA.George H.W. Bush had a decades-long affiliation with the CIA, which he tried to downplay by claiming he only worked with the agency during his brief tenure as director in the mid-1970s. In reality, Bush was a CIA officer as far back as 1953, when he partnered with CIA officer Thomas Devine to form Zapata Petroleum, working under commercial cover. Their oil wells were located just 40 miles from Cuba.One of Bush's tasks as director was to manage the fallout from the CIA's Operation Mockingbird. During a news conference, Bush stated that the CIA would no longer recruit American journalists to be on the agency's payroll. What many missed, however, was his follow-up comment: From now on, reporters and the news media could work with the CIA on a voluntary basis. The CIA has a unique way of turning \"voluntary\" into a requirement, establishing a quid pro quo with major media companies. This arrangement prevented outlets from publishing exposés on CIA activities while providing them with intelligence-derived information to manipulate public opinion.When Bush became vice president in 1981, it essentially placed the CIA in the second-highest seat of the U.S. government. I am convinced that Bush was the agency's mastermind behind the criminal Iran-Contra operation, once again manipulating a president to engage in illegal covert activities.Under President Barack Obama, the CIA implemented a drone assassination program that targeted at least eight wedding parties, killing innocent civilians. The CIA convinced Obama to maintain a kill list of foreigners it considered dangerous, often based on unproven suspicions. In effect, Obama allowed the CIA to act as judge, jury, and executioner.Obama arrested and jailed more intelligence whistleblowers than any previous president, using the outdated Espionage Act. The most notable of these was former CIA case officer John Kiriakou, a top performer in the CIA Counterterrorism Center, who was imprisoned on frivolous charges.During the Obama administration, notorious CIA Director John Brennan made several covert trips to Ukraine to underwrite the 2014 coup, which resulted in the Russia-Ukraine war and the ensuing proxy war between the United States and Russia, bringing America to the brink of World War III.While Donald Trump was president, the CIA launched a full-scale operation to remove him from office for daring to question the agency. Brennan initiated the Russia collusion hoax by leaking the \"Steele dossier,\" a complete fabrication based on false information from Russian intelligence officials. Brennan misled the press, claiming the dossier was CIA intelligence. I have provided an in-depth analysis of this CIA operation on YouTube (@kevinshipp1). This was the CIA's attempt to stage a domestic coup and take down a sitting president. Although the plot failed, no CIA or FBI official faced accountability for their crimes.After Joe Biden's victory, evidence surfaced of Biden's involvement in Ukraine following the 2014 CIA-orchestrated coup. This led to the discovery of Hunter Biden's laptop, which contained salacious videos, along with evidence of sex, drugs, and guns. To protect Biden, 51 former intelligence officials, including 42 senior CIA officers, quickly signed a public statement claiming the laptop story was \"Russian disinformation.\" That was a lie. We must remember that the CIA's core functions include lying, deception, and propaganda, especially when protecting its own existence.We now know the CIA convinced Facebook and Twitter executives to promote Biden for president and censor posts supporting Trump. The cover for the operation? Posts and articles supporting Donald Trump were \"Russian disinformation.\" Russia is always the CIA's boogeyman.This brings us to the upcoming 2024 presidential election. I am an independent, and I am not endorsing either party. My goal is to remain objective and unbiased. The CIA is up to its dirty tricks again, attempting to sway public opinion in the direction of the agency's chosen candidate, Kamala Harris. All 42 of the aforementioned senior CIA officers (the most notorious being Mike Morrell, who attempted to sway the 2016 presidential election in Hillary Clinton's favor) have issued a statement supporting Kamala Harris for president and attacking Trump. That's along with 741 \"national security leaders\" who have endorsed Harris.The CIA is manipulating a presidential election, right in front of the American people -- again.",

    "title": "Despite Trump's Claims, Large Numbers of Noncitizens Don't Vote in US Elections",
    "content": "The idea that large numbers of noncitizens vote in U.S. elections has been disproven.Throughout his political career, former U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that the nation's electoral system is \"rigged\" against him. In the run-up to the 2024 presidential election, Trump and his allies spread rumors questioning the election's integrity even before votes were cast, with the apparent goal of persuading people that a Trump loss to Vice President Kamala Harris could not happen in a fair and just election.In particular, Trump has claimed that if he loses, it would be because a massive number of undocumented immigrants broke federal law and voted for his political opponents. (Trump uses the term \"illegal immigrants\" or \"illegals\" to refer to this group of people.)We boiled Trump's claims down to the following chain of events:Trump uses the rhetoric not just to challenge the integrity of the election, but also to indirectly attack the Democratic Party's pro-immigration stance and its policies regarding the U.S.-Mexico border.However, Trump's claims are contradicted by the following facts:Snopes found that Trump has publicly stated or implied that undocumented immigrants were voting in elections for at least a decade. In a tweet from October 2014, even before he announced his run for president in 2015, Trump claimed \"election officials\" said there were no protections preventing undocumented immigrants from voting in elections, which he said was \"very bad (unfair) for Republicans.\" He did not cite any sources.During the 2016 presidential race, Trump made similar comments. For instance, he questioned the security of same-day voter registration and cited a highly criticized set of data to claim that 14% of noncitizens in the United States were registered to vote.In 2020, Trump famously claimed there was a massive amount of voter fraud and refused to concede the election to Biden. Although his allegations of fraud during that election cycle did not focus on immigration, his efforts to sow seeds of doubt about the integrity of the U.S. electoral process took hold.During the 2022 midterm elections, some Trump supporters who believed he won the 2020 election became poll watchers who intensely scrutinized the election process. According to reporting from Reuters, multiple states recorded incidents of poll watchers intimidating voters and election workers, which is illegal. Additionally, the Republican National Committee (RNC) established a voter integrity program to ensure that the 2022 midterm results were fair.By December 2023, Trump was telling supporters at an Iowa rally to \"guard the vote.\" In April 2024, Trump's campaign announced it would partner with the RNC to continue its voter integrity program in the 2024 election, with the explicit intent, in the campaign's words, to \"stop Democrat attempts to circumvent rules.\" The allegation that undocumented immigrants are illegally registering to vote is only one idea the Trump campaign has used to justify these efforts.The claims spread quickly, however, and were shared by prominent figures like X owner Elon Musk. In September 2024, Reuters reported that Trump's legal team had already filed lawsuits that could be used to challenge the election on the grounds of noncitizen voting in four of the seven swing states expected to decide the election.The fact of the matter is simply that noncitizens rarely vote in U.S. elections, something the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank, reported on in 2020.A 2015 analysis of the survey Trump later used to claim that 14% of noncitizens in the United States were registered to vote found that the result was simply due to human error -- that is, all the \"noncitizens\" who marked themselves as registered to vote were almost certainly U.S. citizens who accidentally recorded themselves as noncitizens when taking the survey.In 2016 and 2017, the Brennan Institute for Justice, a liberal nonprofit organization, investigated 42 jurisdictions across 12 states to find out whether there was any truth to the claims of voter fraud. Of the 10 jurisdictions across the nation with the highest population of noncitizens, the survey looked at eight of them.According to the institute's report, voters cast 23.5 million votes in these jurisdictions in the election. The institute counted 30 cases of suspected noncitizen voting that required further investigation. That's an occurrence rate of 0.0001% -- less than the odds of being struck by lightning in your life.Under federal law, states are required to maintain and audit voter rolls regularly to ensure an election's integrity. As an example, the state of Georgia, expected to play a critical role in the 2024 election, audited its voter rolls in 2022. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, announced that the state found 1,634 cases in which a noncitizen attempted to register to vote between 1997 to 2022, about 65 per year. But according to the report, none of the individuals in those cases ever officially voted, thanks to the existing protections that safeguard the voter registration process.In order to illustrate the numerous protections in place to prevent noncitizens from voting in U.S. federal elections, let's go through the steps an immigrant residing in the country illegally would have to take in order to cast just one ballot and have it counted.First, this person would have to enter the United States without paperwork and apply for political asylum. During this process, the individual's name and other identifying information would be added to a federal database that marked them as a noncitizen.Second, this person would need to apply to register to vote (except in North Dakota, which verifies voter eligibility using a strict voter ID law). All 49 states with voter registration require the voter to attest under penalty of law that they are a U.S. citizen, that they are over the age of 18 and that they are a resident of the state they wish to vote in.These registration forms require applicants to provide a large amount of personal information. This is a problem for immigrants living in the country illegally, who may be afraid the government could use that identifying information to arrest or deport them. In this case, those fears are valid: Any noncitizen found guilty of such a crime would face prison time or deportation.During the voter registration process, the immigrant would have to prove they are a resident of the state they live in, most commonly using a driver's license or Social Security number. In order to apply for that documentation, the immigrant would have to provide more identifying information to the government alongside immigration paperwork that confirms their status as a noncitizen. At this point in the process, there would now be multiple governmental databases that list this person as a noncitizen.Then, each voter registration application is reviewed and cross-checked against driver's license and federal immigration databases from the Department of Homeland Security to scan for any discrepancies. If election officials have any suspicions, they can flag the application for further review. That process requires even more personal information from the voter. If there are still questions, election officials can always deny the application.There are a few jurisdictions in the United States, including San Francisco and Washington, D.C., where noncitizens are allowed to vote, but only in some local elections, not federal elections. In San Francisco, for instance, noncitizens are allowed to vote in school board elections only. However, noncitizens in these jurisdictions must register to vote using a specific form in a specific way. This means that such noncitizens are added to the voter rolls with the explicit knowledge that they are noncitizen voters, and their ballots can be tracked as such.All of these are incredibly effective -- again, Georgia's 2022 audit found that out of the 1,634 cases in which a noncitizen was suspected of attempting to register to vote, not one vote was ever cast. As Gerry Cohen, a member of the Board of Elections in Wake County, North Carolina, told Snopes: \"There's a big difference between registering to vote and actually voting.\"Taylor Kinnerup, communications director for the Maricopa County recorder's office in Arizona, added an additional distinction: \"There's also a big difference between casting a vote and that vote being counted.\"In October 2024, posts on X surfaced alleging that the Texas secretary of state had instructed poll workers to allow voters who presented an ID indicating they were a noncitizen to vote as usual. The claim quickly morphed into the general idea that Texas was allowing noncitizens to vote. This is untrue, because of the protections in place after a ballot is cast.In a directive \"to all election officials,\" Texas Director of Elections Christina Adkins told poll workers to acknowledge the noncitizen ID when checking for a valid voter registration, but pointed out that these voters might just be new U.S. citizens who had not yet updated their driver's licenses to reflect their citizenship status. Denying such eligible voters the right to cast a ballot would be a clear example of illegal voter suppression. The directive recommended that these voters present a different form of photo ID if possible to avoid the issue. Regardless, the work done to ensure that those voters are eligible is performed before the ballot is counted.After arriving at a polling place, voters are required to provide their name (and depending on the jurisdiction, their ID). These names are then checked against registration records (again, except in North Dakota). If there's a match, a ballot is printed for the voter. The voter then signs, affirming under penalty of law that they understand the penalties of casting a fraudulent ballot.The voter's signature is a part of the verification process. Kinnerup said that Maricopa County poll workers compare the signature to the voter's other recorded signatures before the ballot is opened and counted. Just like with voter registration, an election official can flag the ballot for further inspection if they have any doubts about the validity of the voter's signature.Under Section 302 of the Help America Vote Act, signed into law by then-President George W. Bush in 2002, voters who are not on a voter roll but attest that they are an eligible voter can still cast a provisional ballot in a federal election, something that might initially seem concerning. But even in this case, there are still protections. A provisional ballot is counted only if the voter's identity, citizenship and residency can be confirmed in the days following the election. Kinnerup explained the process using an example she said Arizona regularly deals with.\"California is a deep blue state, and some Republicans in Southern California might have the idea to cast a ballot in Arizona because it's a more competitive election,\" she said. \"So there are Republicans in Southern California who drive across the border to Yuma County, Arizona, walk into a polling place and ask for a ballot.\"By law, election workers are required to provide them with one. However, in order for these ballots to count, these voters would need to provide identification to confirm their citizenship and residency. Their California driver's licenses would be a red flag for poll workers, indicating that these voters were not Arizona residents, and the ballots would not be counted after investigating the voters' credentials.Some Republicans have claimed these precautions are still not enough. In April 2024, Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson met with Trump to discuss concerns of voter fraud and noncitizen voting. The bill resulting from that conversation, the SAVE Act, would have mandated that those wishing to register to vote show documented proof of U.S. citizenship. This means that in order to register to vote, voters would have to submit their birth certificate -- a document that 9% of Americans don't have immediate access to, according to research from the Brennan Center. Although the SAVE Act passed the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, the Senate refused to hold a vote on the bill.In September 2024, facing the threat of a government shutdown, Trump posted on his social media platform, Truth Social, calling for Republicans to reject any stopgap spending bill that did not include \"absolute assurances on election security,\" because Democrats were supposedly attempting to \"stuff\" voter registrations with undocumented immigrants. The SAVE Act was briefly resurrected at that point, but Democrats objected to its inclusion in the spending bill. Eventually, Johnson partnered with Democrats to pass a bill that did not include the SAVE Act in order to avoid a government shutdown.It is unclear whether Republicans will continue to pursue further legislation at the federal level to require proof of citizenship to register to vote. At the state level, according to the Brennan Center and the Voting Rights Lab, Arizona, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Hampshire and North Dakota have passed laws since the 2020 election that aimed to address nonexistent noncitizen voting using documented proof of citizenship.Part of what made Trump's claim of noncitizen voting stick is that it combined two of his favorite targets: election integrity and the U.S.-Mexico border. Much of this story has focused on disproving Trump's claims about election integrity. However, it is also important to examine what exactly Trump and his allies claim when criticizing or attacking Kamala Harris in that regard.The post claims that during a town hall with Latino voters, Harris said she wanted to allow \"illegal immigrants to become citizens who will then be able to vote.\"This is an explanation of the Democratic Party's immigration platform and a statement about the privileges of United States citizenship, not an admission that Harris is going to rig the election. Harris is stating a fact: that undocumented immigrants in the United States currently do not have a path to citizenship. Although it is true that giving undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship would eventually allow them, as naturalized citizens, to vote in U.S. federal elections, going through that process would likely take a long time. According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, lawful permanent residents are required to live in the United States for five years before they are eligible to apply for naturalized citizenship.Snopes found no evidence that a significant number of noncitizens are attempting to register to vote in the 2024 election. After explaining the large number of precautions in place to stop noncitizens from voting, both the election officials we spoke to said it is highly unlikely that a noncitizen would be able to successfully cast a vote if they tried, contrary to Trump's claimsCohen, the Wake County Board of Elections member, said he felt baffled by the scale of the claims. \"The thought that a large body of people are doing this is stupid,\" he said. \"It's hard enough to get people to vote as is.\"Kinnerup, from the Maricopa County recorder's office, said she thought people were believing Trump's claims because of a recent change in Arizonan politics. The demographics of Arizona have changed dramatically in recent years, and the media's struggle to predict the winner of Arizona in the last election probably made some voters feel like something had gone wrong.But she also wanted to remind voters that the poll workers were not the enemy. \"Everyone, Democrat and Republican, wants the election to be fair,\" she said. \"There's no such thing as a perfect election. But 2020 taught us a lot -- to prepare for the unexpected.\"",

    "title": "UPDATE: 32 million self-identified Christians expected to sit out of the 2024 presidential election",
    "content": "(OPINION) Upwards of 104 million people of faith -- including some 32 million self-identified Christians who regularly attend church services -- are expected to sit out of the 2024 presidential election.They are likely to hold back from the Nov. 5 contest due to a lack of interest, according to new data from Arizona Christian University's Cultural Research Center, operated by evangelical pollster George Barna. Voter enthusiasm, the study found, decreased significantly from 2020 to 2024.\"The research asked people who indicated they were not likely to vote to explain the reasons for that choice,\" wrote the researchers. \"The most common reason, offered by two-thirds of the non-voters (68%), was a lack of interest in politics and elections.\"More than half of survey respondents -- 57% -- said they dislike both leading candidates, Vice President Kamala Harris and President Donald Trump. And 55% said they don't feel either candidate reflects their values.Researchers reportedly believe that, if the survey's findings prove true on Election Day, Trump's re-election is less likely and Harris could more easily pull off a victory.Barna is encouraging pastors and ministry leaders to use their positions to urge churchgoers to practice their civic duty by casting their ballots on Nov. 5.\"Pastors often seek opportunities to have a positive influence in people's lives and upon the culture, and to help the community in which their church is located,\" he said.\"This research underscores the fact that simply encouraging people to vote in order to fulfill their biblical responsibility would not only be seen as doing their job while helping the community, but an estimated five million regular churchgoers would be likely to vote as a result of that simple exhortation.\"Last month, Dr. Jeff Myers, an author, speaker, and president of Summit Ministries, appeared on CBN's \"Faith vs. Culture,\" where he addressed the question: \"Should Christians avoid politics?\"When stepping into the ballot box, Myers urged Bible-believers to consider \"constitutional principles\" like \"life, liberty,  property,\" because those \"are the three things the Constitution said it's developed in order to provide.\"He explained, \"How do I support life with my vote? How about liberty -- things like religious liberty and free speech? What about property? Who's going to be most likely to think that people ought to have their own property and own businesses?Because there are a lot of worldviews out there, let's be honest, who say the abolition of private property would be a preferable state. So which candidate for any given office is going to be most likely to lessen the evils that occur around life, liberty, and property? ... That is going to help inform my decision.\"While there is plenty in the election cycle that can be discouraging, Myers argued the Bible calls Christians to participate in the process, noting that, in a constitutional republic like the U.S., the people are responsible for forming and holding to account their government.\"Who are the governing authorities?\" Myers asked rhetorically. \"The people. So, in this situation -- in the American context -- if you are a Christian and you are not involved, you are literally disobeying God's admonition to be obedient to the governing authorities.\"",

    "content": "As the 2024 presidential election approaches, Pitt students express a mix of excitement, anxiety and determination as they grapple with their role in the democratic process.In recent months, Pitt's campus has seen a surge in political activity, including visits by former President Barack Obama, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff and other Pennsylvania politicians. Many students said they're eager to vote for the first time, but while some say they remain optimistic about the country's future, others have voiced concerns about polarization and expressed frustration about an increase in apathy among their peers.To gauge the campus' sentiment towards the political atmosphere, The Pitt News spoke with 12 Pitt students about their thoughts about the upcoming election.Nicholas Ditmore, an undeclared first-year student, emphasized the significance of civic participation and expressed confidence in the country's resilience.\"I think that no matter what the outcome of this election is, going either way, our country is so strong that I think that our best days are ahead,\" Ditmore said. \"There's no worry coming from me.\"He said he believes both major parties have engaged in dangerous rhetoric and added that stoking fear about the nation's future is \"not good for our country.\"\"The rhetoric that our country is in danger is not a good thing that we should be saying. I think that we should tamp that rhetoric down,\" Ditmore said. \"The foundations of our country are insanely strong, and I think that no matter who wins, no matter what the outcome is, America is going to prosper.\"Ditmore also highlighted the positive political engagement on campus, noting that he sees lots of first-time voters who are excited for Election Day.\"I think that the amount of activity around the election on campus is very strong right now and I think that's a very good thing,\" Ditmore said. \"We are excited to vote, we're excited to choose the direction of our country ... it's not about going after one party or another, it's about coming together and actually voting for the future of this country.\"Other students shared mixed feelings about the election. Hayley Felan, an undeclared sophomore, voiced concerns about political polarization.\"I'm a little worried, because there's very drastic sides. Ever since the 2016 election, we have been becoming very polarized,\" Felan said. \"I feel like, even before that, it was starting to shift, because of the Right's concerning ideology.\"Felan said they feel some young voters have become more politically engaged following Vice President Kamala Harris' ascension on the ticket, but worried that others still feel apathy towards the democratic process.\"It was looking a little bleak, when Biden was running ... I feel like there was a lot of apathy, especially with students, because they felt like there wasn't really a good side to pick either way,\" Felan said. \"Now that Harris has come onto the ticket ... feelings about the election are going up, because people are more confident in her than they were .\"While some students express concerns, others maintain a more optimistic outlook. Jesse Milston, secretary of the College Republicans, shared his excitement for Republicans in the upcoming election.\"I feel really good about it. I feel very good about our candidates. We have a great slate, and I'm proud to know a lot of them,\" Milston, a sophomore political science and law, criminal justice and society major, said.Milston expressed confidence in Republicans' chances this November, but said no matter the outcome, America will \"prosper.\"\"Regardless of what happens, our country is going to be okay,\" Milston said. \"I just hope we have someone good to steer the helm.\"Some students, like Izzy Ronolder, said they are fearful about the election's potential outcomes.\"I'm so freaking scared,\" Ronolder, a senior social work majorhowever, said. \"No matter which way this goes, it's going to be bad. It just feels like it's going to be bad.\"Zaida Dayton, a junior psychology and gender, sexuality and women's studies major, said she's excited to vote in the upcoming election but reflected on the heightened news awareness many students reported feeling.\"I feel more tuned in because I feel like I'm paying attention to the debates that are going on,\" Dayton said. \"I feel scarily tuned in, but tuned in nonetheless.\"",

    "title": "Peter Schweizer: GAI Study Details 50 Threats to Election Integrity",
    "content": "It's election season in America, and that means early voting, absentee ballots, and making sure your voter registration is current.It's also a test of how well each state maintains its voter rolls, its election systems, and the ways each state assures its elections are conducted and counted fairly.A new report from the Government Accountability Institute (GAI) counts at least fifty threats to election integrity. The report, just out this week, categorizes fifty different threats to election integrity according to whether they concern the influence of \"dark money,\" lawfare operations, voter fraud, or election fraud. The report documents examples of each and offers potential solutions.On the most recent episode of The Drill Down, Peter Schweizer and co-host Eric Eggers tackle the many ways elections can be rigged and, more importantly, how to make sure that it doesn't happen.Many states have been conscientious about cleaning their voter rolls -- removing deceased voters, voters who have left the state, voters who are not U.S. citizens but who were registered through their driver's license applications, and so forth.States such as Michigan, however, have not been so fastidious, as the GAI report and the Drill Down hosts explain. \"We always talk about this because this continues to be a problem in  states that are poised to matter,\" says co-host Eric Eggers. \"In Michigan, we're seeing the number of counties with voter registration rates over 100 percent.\"Eggers wrote a book in 2018 called FRAUD that detailed many of the different types of election rigging and fixing that have taken place in U.S. history. That book, however, was published two years before the 2020 COVID pandemic, and rule changes made by some states that were ostensibly to make voting safer during the pandemic had the effect of making election security much harder to ensure.GAI's report covers how those rule changes, which many states have since been repealed or replaced, may have affected the 2020 outcome and threaten the integrity of the 2024 presidential election.\"We're now seeing 53 counties in Michigan with more than 100% registration, which obviously means there are some names on there that don't belong there,\" Eggers says. He notes this isn't always the fault of local or state election officials. Technically, it is the voter's responsibility to call up their previous state's registrar and ask to be removed from their voter rolls. \"The book I wrote in 2018 came about because of a report  did that focused on duplication in voter rolls. We found more than two thousand instances of double voting in 2016 in Florida alone.\" That report from 2017 is available on GAI's website here.GAI's new report explains how those rule changes, which in many states have since been repealed or replaced, may have affected the 2020 outcome and threaten the integrity of the 2024 presidential election.

    "title": "Trump DeFi project's token sale bombs harder than Joker sequel",
    "content": "Donald Trump's first-ever token sale proved a major bust while opponent Kamala Harris is trying to sell her 'crypto' advocacy to black voters ahead of November's U.S. presidential election.October 15 brought the initial token sale of the Trump-aligned World Liberty Financial (WLF) decentralized finance (DeFi) project. The day before, the WLF team conducted an 'X' Spaces event in which they claimed that more than 100,000 accredited (aka deep-pocketed) investors had been 'whitelisted' to participate in the sale of the WLFI 'governance' token.Trump himself pimped the token sale via his personal X account over the weekend, calling it \"YOUR chance to help shape the future of finance.\" Possibly, but it's primarily YOUR chance to help shape the future of Donald's finances, given the generous allocation of WLFI tokens his family is slated to control.But on the big day, the WLF website repeatedly crashed once the sale got underway, finally appearing to crash for good about an hour into the process. By that point, around 2,900 individual wallets had purchased over 330 million WLFI at a rate of 1.5¢ per token for a total haul of around $5.5 million worth of ETH, USDT and USDC.As the outage dragged on, the WLF official X account failed to offer a single word of explanation as to what happened, what they were doing to remedy it, or when the sale might resume. Equally silent were the X accounts of the Trump offspring -- sons Don Jr., Eric and Barron -- whose photos are on the WLF executive roster as 'Web3 Ambassadors.'The site finally came back online by mid-afternoon, but by 10pm EST, the total number of tokens sold was under 700 million, leaving just under 19.3 billion tokens unclaimed. The total dollar value raised was only around $10 million, a tiny sliver of the $300 million the WLF hype machine claimed it expected to raise.The poor showing appears to have finally shocked the Trumps out of their lethargy, as Donald's X account posted a video on Tuesday evening urging people to \"Get your $WLFI tokens now.\" The full court grift followed with Don Jr. saying \"LETS GO!!!\" while Eric chimed in with \"Everyone ready!?\" Evidently not.Coming just three weeks before November's vote, the token sale gave off two very distinct vibes. First, that Donald is worried that he might lose this nailbiter, so he's grifting like there's (literally) no tomorrow. Second, it was intended as a way for foreign interests to funnel cash to Donald's campaign in violation of campaign finance rules and curry some favor with the potential next leader of the formerly free world.The WLF website notes that \"Donald J. Trump and his family members ... will be entitled to receive significant fees for services provided to World Liberty Financial, which amount cannot yet be determined.\" Also to be determined: exactly what -- if anything -- the Trumps have to do to receive these 'significant fees' beyond pimp the project to the same rubes who bought all the other Trump-branded kitsch (sneakers, watches, Bibles, his multiple series of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), etc.).Speaking of, Gizmodo recently reported that scammers are flocking to Trump's Truth Social platform because the site \"seems to be a target-rich environment for people who are easy to con.\" Ahem.The 'this is fine' printThe WLF team's other big Monday announcement was the appointment of Paxos co-founder Rich Teo as head of WLF's stablecoin operations, whatever they are, because WLF still won't definitively state what their project actually does. We're a couple months into this thing and we're still no clearer on what this transmogrifying wonder-box is supposed to do beyond disappoint.WLF's 'Gold Paper' -- like a white paper but thematically gilded -- states that WLF's 'mission' is to \"democratize access to financial opportunities while fortifying the global status of the US Dollar.\" This will be accomplished by \"supporting US dollar-based stablecoins and DeFi applications that seek to preserve the US Dollar's status.\"However, WLF's primary purpose appears to be little more than serving as an educational hub providing users with \"information about and access to certain third-party DeFi applications.\" This dovetails with the WLF-affiliated trademark applications that were filed this summer, two of which were based on \"providing financial information\" in the fields of 'cryptocurrency' and 'DeFi.'It certainly sounds like WLF will happily promote other operators' DeFi platforms while conveniently disavowing any legal responsibility for whatever happens next. So, basically, the Trump University boondoggle with even less accountability. Will they take a cut of the proceeds derived from these third-party transactions? Is WLF simply a glorified affiliate marketing site?There is currently a \"temperature check proposal to launch an Aave V3 instance for WLF.\" The proposal for accessing the Ethereum-based Aave's decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol would allow WLF users to deposit USDC, USDT, ETH and WBTC, which would serve as collateral to borrow similar assets.But with the token sale a bust and Trump's historic aversion to anything remotely related to the word 'loser,' how much longer might Trump want to be publicly associated with WLF?There is one obvious reason for Trump sticking with WLF. The Gold Paper also revealed that DT Marks DEFI LLC, \"agreed to use reasonable efforts to request the owners and principals of DT Marks DEFI LLC, including Donald Trump, to promote the WLF and the WLF Protocol from time to time.\" So Trump doesn't have to do anything, merely entertain 'requests' to shill for WLF now and then.Trump will also allow WLF to use his name and AI-generated-none-more-manly illustrations of himself in their promotional material. In exchange, \"DT Marks DEFI LLC will receive 22.5 billion $WLFI tokens and a right to receive 75% of the net protocol revenues as defined in the services agreement after deduction of agreed operating expenses and the initial treasury reserve.\"Harris bets on blackMeanwhile, Trump's opponent, Kamala Harris, made her most explicit crypto policy pledge to date in an October 14th document detailing her campaign's efforts to shore up voting support among black males. Titled Vice President Harris Will Deliver for Black Men, the document lays out a five-point 'opportunity agenda' that includes: \"Supporting a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency and other digital assets so Black men who invest in and own these assets are protected.\"The document expands on this point thusly: \"More than 20% of Black Americans own or have owned cryptocurrency assets. Vice President Harris appreciates the ways in which new technologies can broaden access to banking and financial services. She will make sure owners of and investors in digital assets benefit from a regulatory framework so that Black men and others who participate in this market are protected.\"Critics have pointed out that this language is open to interpretation regarding how strict or lenient any Harris-dictated regulatory framework might prove. And in a subsequent speech focused on this 'Black men' agenda, Harris offered no further details on her digital asset policies. In fact, she didn't so much as reference digital assets by name.Speaking on Monday's WLF Spaces event, the reliably animated Don Jr. referenced Harris having allegedly \"adopted this pro-crypto policy.\" But Junior said he \"hopes everyone understands that that's going to be a lie like everything else ... The Crypto Bros and Crypto Girls gotta get out there and understand exactly what's going on.\" Sure, Junior... Hey, maybe you should start an educational website to get this message across?It matters littleOn October 14, Galaxy Research, an offshoot of Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital (NASDAQ: BRPHF) financial services firm, released a 'policy scorecard' detailing how Trump, Harris and current U.S. President Joe Biden differ on various issues affecting the digital asset sector.We'll spare you the eyestrain of reading some extremely tiny type by condensing the findings into eight words: Harris better than Biden, Trump better than Harris. Oh, and while there's \"limited\" downside risk to a Harris victory, there's an \"explosive upside possible\" if Trump gets a second term. (We don't think that phrase refers to projectile vomiting, but who's to say?)Wall Street analysts have their own views, with Bernstein issuing a note this week saying recent spikes in the fiat value of prominent tokens reflect market sentiment that Trump may get a second term. Last week, JPMorgan (NASDAQ: JPM) analysts suggested a Trump win may already be priced in, although a brief spate of irrational exuberance will undoubtedly send BTC soaring should Trump manage a victory that doesn't require angry mobs storming the Capitol.It's not a lie if you believe itMeanwhile, the battle to control this race's narrative shows no sign of letting up. Trump has seen his odds of victory surge on the PolyMarket prediction betting site since the month began, going from a dead heat to Trump holding a commanding 58-42 lead as of October 15.But as previously noted, Trump's PolyMarket rise appears to be based on one deep-pocketed bettor throwing their financial weight behind the GOP candidate. 'Fredi9999' had already acquired roughly seven million shares by early last week, but this number has since more than doubled to over 15 million and is increasing by the hour.Since Fredi9999 has also acquired millions of shares in markets that Trump is unlikely to win -- like the popular vote, something Trump failed to do in both his previous attempts -- it suggests Fredi9999 is more interested in maintaining the public perception that Trump is in the lead, rather than reflect any deep-seated belief.It's worth noting that Fredi9999 has been wrong before, like when he acquired over 14 million shares on a bet that Florida Gov. Ron Desantis would win the 2024 Presidential election. Not for nothing, but Trump's new bestest buddy Elon Musk was a Desantis supporter during the GOP presidential primary campaign.Musk declared earlier this month that prediction markets are \"more accurate than polls, as actual money is on the line.\" Musk, the richest man in the world, appears keen to convince the wider public -- including poll-obsessed media outlets -- that news of Trump's PolyMarket surge should be echoed far and wide. Draw your own conclusions.Congress ain't done yetFinally, Congressional crypto supporters still haven't given up on passing some kind of digital asset legislation in the lame-duck session that follows November's vote. Last week, Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-TN) released a 'discussion draft' of legislation intended to establish \"a clear regulatory framework for the regulation and supervision of stablecoin issuers.\"In a statement, Hagerty acknowledged that his draft \"builds upon the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act\" sponsored by Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC) in the House of Representatives. That bill was approved by the House Financial Services Committee but has yet to come up for a floor vote. Hagerty's bill would compete with the Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act of 2024, which debuted in the Senate this spring but failed to make it out of committee.In a Financial Services Committee hearing last month, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) called for a \"grand bargain\" on stablecoin legislation. Waters, who helped McHenry tinker with the House bill, stated that she hoped to strike such a bargain before the year was through despite several unresolved issues -- including who would have oversight of stablecoin issuers: the federal government or state-level regulators.The Lummis-Gillibrand bill required state-regulated stablecoin issuers to begin a 'transition' to federal oversight once their coin's market cap passes $9 billion and to complete that transition once the cap passes $10 billion.Hagerty's bill claims to \"strengthen the state pathway to stablecoin issuance\" via a clause that allows an issuer whose market cap exceeds $10 billion to ask for a federal waiver \"to remain under a State-level regulatory regime,\" with these waivers subject to annual renewal by the Fed.While hope springs eternal, Rep. John Curtis (R-UT) warned last week that bipartisan support for crypto legislation remains \"very fragile.\" Trump has attempted to claim the mantle of 'crypto president,' but Curtis said that if 'crypto' \"becomes a partisan issue, we will have a very, very difficult time\" approving any digital asset legislation.Watch IPv6 & Blockchain: Pioneering the next digital revolution",

    "title": "'Worst for a GOP candidate this century': Babe wake up, Donald Trump is doing 6 points worse than he did 4 years ago with a key demographic",
    "content": "Donald Trump is losing a valuable voter demographic, but it's hardly a surprise.Donald Trump faces a tough challenge this November, with voters already heading to polls to participate in the 2024 presidential election. And going up against the lively and frequently-memed Kamala Harris instead of a declining Joe Biden makes securing one key demographic that much harder.Current data indicates that Trump is cratering with white women, doing six points worse in Oct. 2024 than he was in Nov. 2020. CNN's senior data reported Harry Enten explained that Trump's margin had fallen from seven points to one, pointing to increased Harris support from that demographic.One might not assume this camp is of the utmost importance to Trump, given all the groping accusations made against him and his documented misogyny. Conversely, it's an invaluable group for his campaign. He still leads in the demographic by a single point, but the advantage is waning rapidly with three weeks to go.47 percent of white women voted for Trump in 2016, compared to 45 for Clinton according to the Pew Research Center. They were significantly more pro-Trump than non-white women, with the overall tally from all women said to be 39 percent in his favor. Therefore, white women accounted for a solid chunk of his election-winning votes.CNN also broke down white women's likely share of votes in the election: white women make up 36 percent, white men 34, women of color 16, and men of color 15. \"White women make up the plurality of the electorate,\" Enten noted.\"When we're talking about five, six seven, point shifts in Kamala Harris' direction we're talking about a major part of the electorate, and that can actually move the overall electorate more than ginormous shift among a considerably smaller part of the electorate,\" he continued, referring Trump's gains with black men and women.Reasons for the 2024 change in the tide could come down to several factors. Trump's many alleged sexual assaults were public in 2016 when he won the election, so the fallout of recent threats against safe and legal abortion in some states as well as Harris being a female candidate are increasing factors.The report also tapped into how abortion is a top voting issue in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, where over 80 percent of voters are white. On average 27 percent of women in these states said abortion was their top voting issue, as opposed to 7 percent of men.\"I think what we're talking about here is after Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, white women in the suburban areas, in these key battleground states, have very much turned against Republicans,\" Enten concluded. One could also argue that Harris appeals to moderate swing voters, being someone whose politics and career have leaned towards centrismThese numbers come at a difficult time for Trump, who on Oct. 14 went viral for a strange Pennsylvania rally where he appeared out of sorts, awkwardly dancing to music on stage for nearly half an hour while onlookers stood by confused. Should he continue to draw concern in key states, who knows how many more points he'll drop?",

Law enforcement sources told WJLA that election day three weeks away is a big factor this year, and officials are concerned that the period between Election Day and Inauguration Day could be extraordinarily tense.MPD is considering going to what's called Alpha Bravo 12-hour days starting before the election and continuing through inauguration day.

Democrats have accused Republicans of trying to introduce a flurry of new rules to delay and confuse the count process in what is a crucial swing state in the presidential election. Early voting began in Georgia on Tuesday.Newsweek sought email comment from the Georgia State Election Board on Wednesday.McBurney noted that the rule initially looks like a good idea, but it will lead to confusion. He granted an injunction preventing the enforcement of the rule, and quoted Kavanaugh, who was appointed to the Supreme Court by former President Donald Trump.In his concurring decision in 2022 in the case of Merrill v. Milligan, Kavanaugh had noted that hand-counting each ballot was too arduous for election workers and could lead to chaos.\"State and local election officials need substantial time to plan for elections. Running elections statewide is extraordinarily complicated and difficult,\" Kavanaugh wrote at the time.\"Those elections require enormous advance preparations by state and local officials and pose significant logistic challenges,\" Kavanaugh added. \" would require heroic efforts by those state and local authorities in the next few weeks -- and even heroic efforts likely would not be enough to avoid chaos and confusion.\"In Merrill v. Milligan, the Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiffs demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success on their claim that an Alabama districting plan violated the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits racial discrimination.McBurney, a Fulton County Superior Court judge, used Kavanaugh's opinion on Tuesday to grant an injunction to the election board in Cobb County, in Atlanta's suburbs.The Cobb County board said that the hand-count rule would disrupt the 2024 presidential election.In Tuesday's ruling, McBurney wrote that the hand count rule \"is too much, too late\" and granted the temporary injunction while he considers the issue further.Gabe Sterling of the Georgia secretary of state's office wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday that more than 328,000 ballots were cast on Tuesday. The previous first-day record was 136,000 in 2020, Sterling added.The Georgia government website, Georgia.gov, says that any registered voter may cast an early ballot.It adds that early voting \"can help Georgia voters avoid crowds or find a time to vote that's better for their schedules in the weeks prior to Election Day.\"",

    "title": "The Chisholm Trail: Spelman College Screens Chisholm '72: Unbought & Unbossed",
    "content": "On Tuesday, Oct. 15, Spelman College hosted a screening of Chisholm '72: Unbought & Unbossed, a documentary chronicling Shirley Chisholm's 1972 campaign as the first Black woman to run for president of the United States. The screening took place on campus in the Camille Olivia Hanks Cosby Ed.D. Auditorium.This screening aligns with the 2024 presidential election currently featuring Kamala Harris, the first female and African American Vice President, who is the current Democratic presidential nominee.\"Looking for a road to freedom, take the Chisholm trail.\" These lyrics were sung by Jesse Jackson's Operation PUSH Choir during Shirley Chisholm's history-making run for President of the United States. The phrase \"Chisholm Trail\" is a clever play on words, connecting Shirley Chisholm's name with the historic cattle-driving route used in the post-Civil War era. Just as that trail symbolized progress and opportunity, Chisholm's presidential run carved a new path in the post-Civil Rights era, inspiring generations to pursue political freedom and representation, a message particularly relevant as the 2024 election approaches.The documentary, opened with a rap ad from the \"Rock the Vote\" campaign, aimed at encouraging youth involvement in politics. From there, it moved to Chisholm's 1972 announcement of her candidacy for president, setting the tone for the film's exploration of her groundbreaking campaign. Chisholm was not only the first Black woman to run for the highest office in the nation, but she also broke new ground as an African American in U.S. politics.The film, which runs 1 hour and 17 minutes, provides a rich look at Chisholm's life, including her family's move from Barbados to New York and her rise in political advocacy. It also features testimonials from key figures in her life, such as Victor L. Robles, her ex-husband Conrad Chisholm, Octavia Butler, Reverend Walter Fauntroy, and Bobby Seale.Following the screening, a panel discussion was held featuring the film's director, Shola Lynch, who made her directorial debut with this documentary in 2004, and is now the Diana King Endowed Professor at Spelman College. Joining her was Dr. Ayoka Chenzira, Professor Emerita of Art and Visual Culture at Spelman. The two engaged in a thoughtful conversation about Chisholm's legacy and the impact her candidacy had on future generations of women and people of color in politics.\"If I couldn't see her, how would the rest of the world see her?\" Lynch recalled, referring to the lack of media coverage around Chisholm's run. \"The news didn't cover her run for president because nobody thought that she would win.\" Lynch also spoke about the research process behind the documentary. \"It's not a documentary if you don't do research,\" she said, remarking on the importance of digging into archives, especially for Black history, which is often under-documented. \"Even in the film, the best footage was taken by two students who talked Chisholm into letting them follow her around.\"The discussion was opened up to audience questions, allowing attendees to reflect on their personal connections to Chisholm's legacy and how her story resonates today. During the Q&A session, Lynch reflected on how history is much like a relay race, with each generation building on the last. \"We wouldn't be here today if it weren't for Shirley Chisholm, and I wish she was around to see it,\" Lynch said. She noted that Chisholm was not the only trailblazer, mentioning others like Jesse Jackson and Barack Obama, whose campaigns furthered the legacy Chisholm helped create.Lynch also challenged the audience to think about their own activism. \"If you're a political person, if you're an activist, if you believe in justice, how is that part of your life every day?\" Lynch asked, urging everyone to reflect on how they can honor the work of leaders like Chisholm by actively participating in shaping the future of political freedom and representation.As Chisholm stated in the documentary, \"I want to be remembered as a woman who fought for change in the 20th century.\" Her legacy, evident in the 2024 election and beyond, knowingly, or unknowingly continues to inspire and encourage a new generation of political activists and leaders.",

    "content": "The current Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris has often been subjected to questions regarding her ethnicity and background. Born on October 20, 1964, in Oakland California, Harris is the daughter of immigrants.But is she Indian? That is one question that has lingered across the mind of many voters ahead of the 2024 US presidential election where she is running against former US president and Republican nominee Donald Trump.Harris' mother Shyamala Gopalan was from India, while her father Donald Harris is of Jamaican descent.Kamal Harris' Indian HeritageHarris' Indian roots come from her mother, who was born in Chennai, India.Shyamala Gopalan was a renowned breast cancer researcher and civil rights activist. She immigrated to the US in the 1960s to pursue her education and career.Harris has frequently spoken about the influence her mother had on her life, speaking about the values of hard work, education, and social justice.In interviews, Harris has highlighted her Indian heritage, expressing pride in her mother's cultural background.She has shared stories of her childhood, including experiences with Indian cuisine and traditions, which shaped her identity.In a recent interview, while talking about her mom, Harris said: \"I realised she was actually teaching me to think about where you had agency in that moment and think about what you had the choice to do or not to do.\"\"As a young girl visiting my grandparents in India, my grandfather took me on his morning walks, where he would discuss the importance of fighting for equality and fighting corruption. He was a retired civil servant who had been part of the movement to win India's independence,\" Harris had said.Harris visited IndiaSoon after Harris stepped into the Presidential race, most people in a town in Tamil Nadu named Thulasendrapuram started praying every day for her win.Thulasendrapuram is said to be Harris' ancestral village, where her maternal grandfather P V Gopalan lived some 100 years ago.As per a report by Reuters, Harris was born and raised in California but visited Thulasendrapuram when she was five.Harris' Jamaican rootsHarris' father, Donald Harris, is a Jamaican national who moved to the US to study at Stanford University. He has had a successful career as an economics professor.His Jamaican roots also play a significant role in Harris's identity, contributing to her multicultural background.Identity & representationHarris' mixed heritage makes her a unique figure in American politics. As the first female Vice President, and the first of Black and South Asian descent, she represents a diverse America.Harris often discusses the importance of representation and inclusivity, echoing the sentiments of her upbringing.Is Kamala Harris Indian?Yes, she is of Indian descent through her mother, Shyamala Gopalan. However, her identity is multifaceted, encompassing her Jamaican heritage as well.",

    "title": "Sebastian Stan said that what he uncovered while playing Donald Trump in 'The Apprentice' was 'tragic'",
    "content": "\"I was fascinated to see what has happened to this man,\" Stan told Yahoo Entertainment.Many actors have portrayed Donald Trump onscreen over the years, from Alec Baldwin to Brendan Gleeson. Sebastian Stan wanted his turn to be different.When Stan was tapped for the lead role in The Apprentice, a movie that follows the then real estate mogul's friendship with notorious lawyer Roy Cohn, he did his own research. He read countless interviews and watched as much footage of Trump from the '70s and '80s as possible, listening to him \"nonstop\" and \"getting that into  bloodstream.\"Stan told Yahoo Entertainment that immersing himself in Trump's early life revealed a side of him many might not expect to see as we're \"inundated\" by media coverage of the former president, who is running for reelection.\"Looking back on some of those earlier interviews with him when he was really young and trying to get tax abatements to  the Grand Hyatt, there was something ... pure and honest, and there was great potential that I saw in that person at that time,\" he said. \"I was fascinated to see what has happened to this man.\"Stan said that under Cohn's guidance, Trump became more \"brutal.\"\"The loss of empathy and humanity, I think, was really tragic,\" he added.The Apprentice was written by Gabriel Sherman, a reporter who covered Trump's life extensively before the presidency. Stan's impression evolves as Trump gets older, taking on the voice, mannerisms, appearance and speech patterns that the former president is now known for.\"As the success kept growing, so did the persona and the brand that he was building,\" Stan said. \"I find all of this stuff to be a shtick at the end of the day, and I would actually argue that it's more conscious than subconscious on his part.\"The changes, at first, are subtle scene by scene -- until at the end of the movie, when Trump is shown repeating Cohn's three \"rules of winning,\" sounding more like his former mentor than the Trump seen at the beginning of the film.Stan said he worked with director Ali Abbasi to trace Trump's evolution in a way that is \"digestible to an audience that already was coming into the theater with a lot of impressions and projections.\"Abbasi, an Iranian-Danish filmmaker, didn't know much about Trump until he went viral for slowly descending on an escalator in front of a crowd before announcing he was running for president in 2015.Abbasi told Yahoo Entertainment that bringing an outsider's perspective to a story about the Republican presidential nominee was both a strength and a weakness.\"It's probably not a good thing to fetishize some of these things too much, you know?\" Abbasi said. \"I think we approach this era and these characters with a lack of reverence or respect, which gave the movie its edge or its rawness.\"He might not have picked up on the significance of certain clubs Trump frequented, but he wanted to look at the story \"more as an anthropologist\" who looks at characters \"in bigger context\" rather than judging things as high- or lowbrow.Stan said he felt like the opportunity to play Trump was \"something that I guess I couldn't ignore, ultimately,\" though he was nervous about it at first. He was drawn to working with Abbasi as the \"captain of the ship\" because he offers a unique point of view as someone who lives abroad.\"Sometimes we need to look at the people that are looking down at us ... to help us get perspective of what's happening in the trenches,\" Stan said.Trump's lawyers filed a cease and desist letter against the movie after its Cannes Film Festival premiere in May, calling it a \"malicious defamation\" that \"should not see the light of day.\" Following the film's Oct. 11 theatrical release, Trump condemned the movie in a Truth Social post as a \"cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election.\" In response, Abbasi wrote in an X post that he was \"available to talk further.\"Abbasi told Yahoo Entertainment that he didn't think the film would be so controversial -- in his eyes, it's \"raw but balanced.\"\" did a really beautiful job of fact-checking and rigorous journalistic work,\" he said. \"When we worked on the script together, there wasn't a moment where I thought, 'This is ... a dirty secret that nobody knew!' It was well researched and the sources were out in the open. There's nothing here that you can't find with one Google search.\"I wasn't naive about  being a divisive figure, but I was maybe a bit naive about how the rest of the world would embrace that and how the corporate structure in Hollywood would want to jump on the opportunity,\" he said.After Trump's legal threat, the film struggled to find a distributor. Its first week in theaters only generated $1.6 million at the box office, but Abbasi wasn't bothered.\"More people went in to watch #TheApprentice in a weekend than a whole week of Trump rallies!\" Abbasi posted on X.",

    "title": "Trump Cult Crazies Blame Hurricanes On 'Weather Control' -- And Defame FEMA",
    "content": "Chances are quite good that yet another major hurricane will come ashore in the United States some time before the 2024 presidential election is decided, and that it will afflict mainly Republican areas of the country. And if that should happen, large parts of the country will go even crazier than they already are.And that is seriously crazy. Barking mad.No particular expertise is required to see how these things could happen. We're still in the midst of hurricane season, after all, and 2024 has been a particularly active one so far. Also, if you glance at a map, Southern coastal regions is where Republicans live. Damn few Democratic strongholds in the gulf states.Houston, New Orleans, that's about it. You'd think even a dunce like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) could figure that out.But no, the Georgia Republican thinks it's all a big conspiracy. She professes to believe that \"they\" control the weather. \"They\" presumably being the same mysterious cabal responsible for \"Jewish space lasers\" that caused massive wildfires in California a while back.What's more she has lots of company. Writing in The Atlantic, Charlie Warzel documented how crackpot conspiracy theories swept the internet. \"Infowars'\" Alex Jones alleged that Hurricanes Helene and Milton were \"weather weapons\" deployed against American patriots by the U.S. government, i.e. the Biden administration.\"Scrolling through these platforms,\" Warzel wrote \"watching them fill with false information, harebrained theories, and doctored images -- all while panicked residents boarded up their houses, struggled to evacuate, and prayed that their worldly possessions wouldn't be obliterated overnight -- offered a portrait of American discourse almost too bleak to reckon with head-on.\"Remember when Vice President Al Gore used to carry on about \"the information superhighway\" that was going to usher in a new age of enlightenment? Well, that's not what happened.Instead of roadside shacks at the edge of town housing palm readers, tarot card mavens, horoscope experts and other solitary purveyors of mystical mumbo jumbo and superstition, we now have websites peddling delusional nonsense to thousands. Sheer folly has gotten organized.And the politicians are not far behind. Donald Trump, J.D. Vance, and Fox News have all peddled the lie that FEMA (the Federal Emergency Management Administration) is offering only one-time payments of $750 to homeowners who have lost their property due to the hurricanes, and that the money must be repaid.None of that is true. Republican governors in the affected states have been unanimous in praising the federal response.Elon Musk, owner of X, claimed -- utterly without evidence, because it's also absolutely false -- that FEMA was \"actively blocking shipments and seizing goods and services locally and locking them away...It's very real and scary how much they have taken control to stop people helping.\"Musk's post has been read a reported 40 million times.If the United States is going to deport immigrants, maybe we should ship him back to South Africa.Anyway, in consequence of Musk and Trump's lies, crazy people have been harassing and threatening to shoot FEMA workers trying to deliver life-saving supplies to hurricane victims. Other idiots are threatening to kill TV meteorologists for debunking \"weaponized weather\" fables.It's enough to make a newspaper columnist feel superfluous. I used to get death threats all the time. Haven't had one for months now. Perhaps I should become an \"influencer.\"Anyway, hurricane or no hurricane, when and by whom will the 2024 election be decided? It's not necessary to use your Marjorie Taylor Greene magic decoder ring to understand that the signs and portents aren't good. Is there any chance that candidate Trump would concede defeat? I would say that there is no chance at all.The man has been visibly \"decompensating,\" as psychologists say, for months now. During his increasingly chaotic \"rallies,\" Trump can scarcely keep a coherent thought in his head. It's all sharks, Hannibal Lecter, and name-calling Kamala Harris now. At an appearance near Philadelphia the other night, he quit talking and stood listening to recorded music for fully forty minutes. Just stood there.That's a long damn time. Members of the Trump Cult pretended it was a genius stroke, because that's what cults do. There is pretty much no behavior so bizarre that it can't be rationalized as an expression of sheer genius. Adepts surrender to reality quietly, and one at a time. Meanwhile, Trump is much more far gone than Joe Biden at his most confused.That doesn't mean Trump can't try to incite an insurrection if he loses come November 5. But it surely means the effort would fail. But what do I know? I'm one of those \"radical left lunatics\" the great man blames for betraying America. An elitist. A guy who believes what the National Weather Service tells him.",

    "content": "Good morning. It is Wednesday, Oct. 16 -- slightly less than three weeks until the polls close on the 2024 presidential election. Here's what's happening in Opinion.I saw Alex Garland's \"Civil War\" on Max this weekend. And though it's a well-done film, I don't recommend watching it right now. The story line of Americans slaughtering each other because of where they are from or their political affiliation strikes a little too close to home.After Jan. 6, 2021, I no longer find it difficult to imagine a future in which the United States has disintegrated into warring tribes, and the president has refused to leave office after two terms and has ordered airstrikes on U.S. citizens. (Although I still don't buy the California/Texas alliance.)And things aren't looking better for this next transition as the actual and rhetorical violence during this presidential election is unprecedented, at least in my lifetime. As much as I want this election to be over, I'm afraid of what comes next.If Vice President Kamala Harris wins, will Trump voters riot again? If former President Trump wins, will the violent element among his base feel empowered to act out against their political enemies? Some of them already feel comfortable enough to fly their fascist (swastika) flags at his rallies.You know who also seems to be expecting pandemonium? Trump, who told Fox News on Sunday that he's worried about election day violence from \"radical left lunatics\" and that the National Guard or U.S. military should be deployed against the \"enemy from within.\" Who are these radicals, exactly? Trump only mentioned one person -- mild-mannered Burbank Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff, who is running for U.S. Senate. Clearly Trump is already setting up the alternative narrative should his well-armed superfans act out violently again, if their candidate loses again.Gen. Mark Milley is right: Trump proved himself unfit to be commander in chief. And if he gets a second term, the former president is bound to \"deploy the military as a political prop in service of his own brand, as he already tried to do. And he would reshape the military and the national security apparatus so that Trumpists would rise and others would not, \" writes U.S. Army veteran ML Cavanaugh.The GOP assault on election integrity has already begun. Republicans are filing lawsuits and challenges to local election rules, targeting mail-in ballots, drop boxes and most every measure to make it easier for people to vote. \"Since 2020, red states have enacted voting restrictions under the guise of 'election integrity,' though fraud is all but nonexistent,\" writes columnist Jackie Calmes.If you're rethinking going to college, think again. Education journalist Jay Mathews worries that the trend toward college alternatives \"may push high school too far in a new direction -- awarding diplomas for off-campus apprenticeships, for spending too little time on homework and too much on gaining work and resume experience, or for minimal vocational ed -- risking students' foundation in literature, history, writing, math and languages.\"The complete list of The Times' electoral endorsements. The editorial board has finished making recommendations for the Nov. 5 election, including state, city and county propositions, the L.A. County judicial races and Los Angeles Community College District Board. The board also made endorsements in L.A. City Council, L.A.

    "content": "Judge Robert McBurney appeared to choose Kavanaugh's words to counter any Republican challenge to the Supreme Court.The Republican-led Georgia State Election Board introduced a rule in September that three election workers must each count all the presidential ballots by hand. Democrats have accused Republicans of trying to introduce a flurry of new rules to delay and confuse the count process in what is a crucial swing state in the presidential election. Early voting began in Georgia on Tuesday.Newsweek sought email comment from the Georgia State Election Board on Wednesday.McBurney noted that the rule initially looks like a good idea, but it will lead to confusion. He granted an injunction preventing the enforcement of the rule, and quoted Kavanaugh, who was appointed to the Supreme Court by former President Donald Trump.In his concurring decision in 2022 in the case of Merrill v. Milligan, Kavanaugh had noted that hand-counting each ballot was too arduous for election workers and could lead to chaos.\"State and local election officials need substantial time to plan for elections. Running elections statewide is extraordinarily complicated and difficult,\" Kavanaugh wrote at the time.\"Those elections require enormous advance preparations by state and local officials and pose significant logistic challenges,\" Kavanaugh added. \" would require heroic efforts by those state and local authorities in the next few weeks -- and even heroic efforts likely would not be enough to avoid chaos and confusion.\"In Merrill v. Milligan, the Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiffs demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success on their claim that an Alabama districting plan violated the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits racial discrimination.McBurney, a Fulton County Superior Court judge, used Kavanaugh's opinion on Tuesday to grant an injunction to the election board in Cobb County, in Atlanta's suburbs.The Cobb County board said that the hand-count rule would disrupt the 2024 presidential election.In Tuesday's ruling, McBurney wrote that the hand count rule \"is too much, too late\" and granted the temporary injunction while he considers the issue further.Gabe Sterling of the Georgia secretary of state's office wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday that more than 328,000 ballots were cast on Tuesday. The previous first-day record was 136,000 in 2020, Sterling added.The Georgia government website, Georgia.gov, says that any registered voter may cast an early ballot.It adds that early voting \"can help Georgia voters avoid crowds or find a time to vote that's better for their schedules in the weeks prior to Election Day.\"",

    "content": "Analysts are warning of a potential Bitcoin price correction as open interest in futures markets climbs to new highs for 2024, while trading volumes remain subdued.Experts have suggested that the imbalance between rising leverage and declining activity could create conditions for sudden price reversals if traders begin closing long positions.\"Open interest has reached a new peak for the year, and funding rates are at their highest since June,\" Illia Otychenko, Lead Analyst at CEX.IO told Decrypt. \"But the troubling part is the downtrend in volume. This means fewer traders are actively participating, but those that remain are heavily leveraged. The market is becoming fragile, and any loss of momentum could trigger a swift correction.\"Bitcoin experienced sharp swings overnight, reaching a high of $67,922 before dropping to $65,160 in less than an hour. This volatility wiped out $302.25 million in leveraged positions, with $185.9 million in long positions liquidated as the price fell, according to data from CoinGlass.Bitcoin has since rebounded slightly, trading at $67,120 during European hours, TradingView data shows.Otychenko noted that the mismatch between open interest and volume makes Bitcoin's market highly sensitive to any abrupt shifts in sentiment.\"A drop in volume while leverage rises is a red flag -- it creates an environment where even small price changes can spark liquidation cascades. If traders start locking in profits, especially on long positions, the market could unravel quickly,\" he explained.Technical indicators further support the caution. Bitcoin is testing resistance at $68,000, a level it has struggled to break through. The asset is also approaching the upper boundary of the Bollinger Bands, signaling a potential pullback. Indicators like the RSI and MACD are showing bearish divergences, hinting that the current rally might lack the momentum to sustain further upward movement.RSI (Relative Strength Index) measures the speed and change of price movements to indicate whether an asset is overbought or oversold, while MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) tracks momentum and trend changes by comparing moving averages to signal potential reversals.In a note sent to Decrypt, Valentin Fournier, an analyst at BRN, highlighted the importance of institutional flows in the market's recent behavior.\"Institutional support remains strong, with $371 million in ETF inflows yesterday,\" Fournier said. \"The Fear and Greed Index has risen to 73, reflecting growing confidence among market participants.

    "title": "Climate Change Action Depends on the 2024 Election",
    "content": "Wildfires that forced thousands to evacuate and destroyed hundreds of homes and other structures; heat waves that smothered the Southwest in sweltering, deadly heat for weeks on end; and hurricanes that have wrought catastrophic damage, nearly wiping away whole towns -- these are just a few of the climate-change-fueled disasters that have taken hundreds of lives in the U.S. so far this year. Conservatively, such disasters cost the country $150 billion annually, and that is with just 1.1 degrees Celsius of warming since preindustrial times. No part of the country is immune to the effects.Climate scientists are in clear agreement that in order to avoid ever-worsening disasters and disruptions to our societies, the world must rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The policies put in place over the next few years will determine what the future climate looks like and what threats the world will face. The U.S. is crucial to this effort. And in the 2024 presidential election contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump, voters have a choice between diametrically opposed visions of what the country must do. \"When it comes to climate change, the contrast between Trump and Harris could not be more stark,\" says Leah Stokes, a University of California, Santa Barbara, political scientist who focuses on energy and climate.Over the past four years, the Biden-Harris administration has taken by far the most action to address the climate crisis of any U.S. presidential administration -- primarily through enacting the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), for which Harris cast the tiebreaking vote. The administration has also strengthened many environmental regulations and made environmental justice a key goal. During her speech in which she accepted the Democratic nomination for the presidential race, Harris said people in the U.S. deserve \"the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water and live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis.\"If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.Trump has stated that he wants clean air and water -- but his administration rolled back more than 200 environmental regulations. He has appointed Supreme Court justices who overturned decades of wetland protections and weakened the role of science in government policymaking. And the plans laid out under the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 (widely considered a blueprint for a second Trump administration) would seek to build on that deregulation, maximize fossil-fuel production and dismantle much of the government's climate science apparatus. Although the Trump campaign has tried to distance itself from Project 2025, many former Trump officials helped draft it. And in 2018 the Heritage Foundation trumpeted that the then-sitting Trump administration had adopted nearly two thirds of the conservative think tank's policy recommendations. Trump has also said that he would rescind unspent IRA funds and that climate change is \"not our problem.\" But the U.S. is the largest historical contributor to global warming, and abundant research shows that climate change is worsening extreme weather disasters here and elsewhere. \"Any way you slice it, it is firmly the U.S.'s problem,\" says Robbie Orvis, senior director of modeling and analysis at Energy Innovation (EI), a nonpartisan energy and climate policy think tank. \"You can't put up a wall for climate.\"Climate Policies Past and PresentBy far the biggest signature climate initiative of the Biden-Harris administration is the IRA, which pledged $369 billion in climate investments over 10 years. Adding to that are climate-related provisions in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the CHIPS and Science Act. There are also major new Environmental Protection Agency regulations that target carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, methane pollution from the oil and gas industry, and vehicle tailpipe emissions. This policy push is \"more than doubling the annual pace of emissions reductions this decade compared to the rate achieved in the 2010s,\" according to an EI report.With the added investment, tax incentives and continued declines in costs, renewable energy and battery storage have dominated new electricity generation projects in the U.S. in the last couple of years. Electric vehicle sales reached record levels in 2023. But oil and gas production have also reached record highs during both the Trump and Biden-Harris administrations, and the U.S. is the world's top natural gas exporter.It is unclear exactly where Harris stands on the question of U.S. fossil-fuel production, though she has spoken about the need for a mix of energy sources and said she no longer supports a ban on fracking. Stokes notes that Trump, on the other hand, has said that on day one, he wants to begin to \"drill, drill, drill,\" and the Washington Post reported that when meeting with oil executives this spring, Trump said he would immediately reverse a number of environmental policies if they raised $1 billion to help him get reelected. Project 2025 also calls for cutting government research into clean energy technologies and maximizing fossil-fuel extraction on federal lands.To provide a broad look at how potential policies under Harris or Trump would shape future U.S. emissions, Orvis's team at EI used its Energy Policy Simulator, an open-source computer model. The researchers compared current policies under the Biden-Harris administration with more ambitious policies that achieve a target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and with the policies laid out in Project 2025. They found that the latter scenario \"basically stops the progress that's been made,\" Orvis says. And even if current policies aren't enough to meet international climate goals, any progress that can be made is crucial because \"each tenth of a degree  is more damaging than the previous one.\"And jettisoning IRA provisions and other Biden climate policies wouldn't just impact emissions. \"We're clearly in the middle of a large manufacturing renaissance in the U.S.,\" Orvis says, and this is partly because IRA incentives made it competitive for clean energy companies to be built here. Scrapping those incentives could mean that companies would take hundreds of billions of dollars in investments -- and the jobs that come with them -- to other countries. Such action would \"permanently exclude the U.S. from being a clean energy manufacturer and exporter because the ship will have sailed in the next few years,\" Orvis says. Continued fossil-fuel extraction and use in power generation would also increase household energy costs, the EI report found.Trump's running mate, J.D. Vance, has decried the IRA and said a Trump administration would undo it. But during the recent vice presidential debate, he said tackling climate change would require bringing back \"as much American manufacturing as possible, and you'd want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America.\" But \"that is exactly what the Inflation Reduction Act is doing,\" Orvis says. \"Eliminating that would be disastrous for those industries.\"Though Harris has not laid out specific climate and energy plans, Stokes and Costa Samaras, director of the Carnegie Mellon University Scott Institute for Energy Innovation, point to her proposed policy to incentivize building more affordable housing (particularly multifamily dwellings such as apartment buildings). \"There's a lot of the greenhouse gas emissions in the economy that are wrapped up into where people live,\" Samaras says. If built nearer to urban centers or closer to public transportation routes, that could mean more people can take trains or buses to work instead of driving, for example. \"Housing policy is climate policy,\" says Samaras, who also worked for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy until this year.Disaster Preparedness and ResponseRegardless of who wins, the next president will have to deal with the consequences of climate change. Disasters such as hurricanes, floods and heat waves will continue to strike the country with increasing frequency and severity.The Biden-Harris administration has emphasized climate resilience and preparing communities to better withstand disasters, and it launched an initiative to provide states with money to improve building codes. The IRA and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law \"are also giant climate resilience laws, the biggest in history,\" Samaras says. And Harris has decried misinformation that Trump has spread around the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)'s response to Hurricanes Helene and Milton.The Project 2025 plan, in contrast, calls for slashing funding to disaster response, ending disaster preparedness grants and doing away with the National Flood Insurance Program. The latter is the only way that many people in the U.S. can afford flood insurance, which is not covered by standard homeowners' policies because private insurers fear the high risks of incurring major costs. And during his first administration, Trump refused to approve disaster aid to areas hit by California wildfires until staffers showed him that those areas had voted for him, multiple staffers told POLITICO's E&E News. Presidential budget requests made during Trump's first term also included major cuts to FEMA, including for repairing high-risk dams and creating flood maps.Project 2025 calls for stripping the National Weather Service of its forecasting duties, which would relegate it to data collection, and shifting forecasting to private companies. The plan would effectively replace a single, central warning system with a patchwork of apps and websites that users might have to pay to access. \"It's inequitable,\" Samaras says. \"It's bad science. It's going to cost people's lives.\"For climate experts like Samaras, Stokes and Orvis, the choice in this election on the climate front is clear -- because, as Samaras says, \"Every year matters. Every ton  matters. Every action matters.\"",

Even when Jesus came down to Earth, He never demanded to be worshipped.He who is God, sohumbled Himself to became man and led a humble life as He showed men, the path to salvation. But here you are, together with some self-acclaimed men and women of God, parading yourselves around as if all authority in Heaven and on earth have been given to you, to do whatever you like.Unfortunately, your conducts are rather making a mockery of Christianity, which now seems to be an avenuefor amassing of wealth and fame, instead of amassing souls to Heaven. And by your deeds, any non-Christian who has not read the Bible may think Christianity is a bad religion and Christ is fake. You are doing great injustice to Christianity and this is sinful.And when God-fearing people draw your attention to your false prophecies and your un-Christlike manners, you get mad at them and curse them. True Christians do not do that. Jesus Christ was spat upon, slapped, beaten with whips and finally nailed to the Cross, but He rather pleaded with God to forgive those who did that to Him (Luke 23:34).And Stephen also prayed for forgiveness for those who were killing him (Acts 7:60). Be very careful who you curse. You may curse someone after God's heart and consequences may not be good for you. Seriously, by your deeds are you truly a servant of Godand a follower of Christ?Personally, anddrawing from the knowledge of virtues I get from my Church, the Holy Catholic Church, I do not see the virtue of humility, the foundation of all virtues in you and those self-acclaimed servants of God, who openly attack each other with curses and display of who is more powerful.The Sacred Scriptures teaches me a lot about the true prophets of God and the false ones. The true prophets always say exactly what God tells them, \"Thus says the Lord!\" Whether palatable or not; And areready to die for saying it.The false prophets are always around the politicians, (the kings, etc.) and will always tell them what will please them (Jeremiah 23:9-40; Ezekiel 13.) From what I read about true prophets and false ones, it looks like we have in Ghana, prophets who want to be favoured by politicians and that classifiesthe lot of you,as false prophets.You lot are not doing Christianity any favour by always being divided over what you say are God's prophecies on issues, most especially on who will be the next president. How come the One and Same True God have different opinions when it comes to a simple issue like who will lead the nation?If indeed, God spoke those words, then we may havein one group,the true prophets and in another, the false ones.Over the past three years, you come out strongly with two names who will win the 2024 presidential election. First, you said God has told you that Alan Kyerematen would win both the NPP presidential primary and become our next president in 2025.Unfortunately, Alan did not contest the primary and went on to leave the NPP to run as an independent candidate in the presidential race. So, are you saying God did not know this will happen?Then, you came back to tell us that, God has chosen Mahama to win the presidential election. If this is truly a prophecy from God, then He must tell us why Mahama, since you said in 2020, that God told you, Mahama will never be president again. Or is it because NPP did not give you what you demanded; you have decided to shift to the NDC, hoping to still maintain your title and rank as presidential prophet?Or, you do not want a non-Christian to lead this country? I have to ask these questions, not because I am against Mahama winning, but you are just a confused lot. If Mahama wins, it will be through the daily prayerful intercessions by true and good Christians and non-Christians and also through his total submission to God and his personal relationship with Christ. You have no contribution in this.Now assuming Mahama does not win, what will be your caveat? You will come to say he did not do what you told him to do?So, come out clear and tell us now, what Mahama must do to win this election. So that if evidence shows that he did not do what he was instructed to do and he fails to win, we will believe your prophecy.One of your followers was on television, saying he had a vision of you in the spiritual realm, forcefully taking the sword of governance from Nana Addo. Who does he think he is deceiving? Every body knows that Nana Addo is not contesting elections and had pledged to hand-over to the one who wins the elections, so what is this about him keeping that sword? Come on, we are not children who can easily be deceived. But, why were you appointed to fight him for the sword, when you are not contesting the presidential elections? Stop these jokes.You and some of the prophets are on television prophesying bloody conflicts during and after the 2024 Elections. We have heard all this before. No blood shed will occur during Election 2024. Personnel in our Armed Forces are for the nation and not for any politician, sothey will never allow this to happen.Now, when we come to the issue of humility, none inyour class of modern-day tele-prophets, can score even a grade \"E\". Your pride and arroganceare just too much.Remember the true servants of God and Jesus, Himself were so humble and would never make themselves important even after performing miracles.In 2 Kings 5, is a classic example of how a humble prophet of God should conduct himself. This was about Naaman the Syrian general and Prophet Elisha, who never came to meet the general, to draw attention to himself, but only send down instructions on how he can be healed.And there are occasions when Jesus either directly forbade people He cured from broadcasting about Him or He simply shied away from the scene.If it were you and those others, you will throw yourself around feeling so important and demanding to be adored.Personally, I do not believe you are what you claim to be. You are an embarrassment to Christianity and you must be told this truth.In December 2018, you said God gave you a list of people who would die in 2019, which included the former first lady H.E. Theresa Kufuor, who was 83 years at that time and the National Chief Imam, Shiekh Nuhu Sharubutu who was 99 years, then.When the Muslim youth,stormed your church for further clarifications, you run to the National Chief Imam and went down on all four, like Afia Pokuaa at the Manhyia Palace, and begged for forgiveness, adding that God's prophecy was not correct and the Shiekh was no longer going to die. Either you must be very powerful to be able to halt, whatever God decides to do, or you are fake. I will settle for the latter. Prophets of old, died for proclaiming God's prophecy, but here you are declaring God never spoke well, just to save your skin. That day you made Christianity look fake and a scam.As you are aware, the former First Lady, lived on for almost five more years before departingthis life to eternal glory and the National Chief Imam is now 105 years and still very strong as God keeps blessing him every day.Some education for you, when God says to someone, he is to die, it means the person's soul will perish in hell (2 Kings 20: 1-4 and the Book of Jonah). When someone is to die and gain eternal life in Heaven, God will say, \"today, you will be with Me in Paradise.\"(Luke 23:42-43). These words from Jesus to the dying Dismas, the repentant armed robber, saved his soul.Another thing that you should be aware of, prophecies which are about someone, are to be told directly to them and not proclaimed publicly. Prophet Nathan's encounter with King David is a classic example, (2 Samuel 12:1-25). Verse 1, is clear:\"God sent Nathan to David...\" God did not send Nathan to the public square. David could have been dethroned if what he did went public. But you always go public with people's prophecies. A real prophet will never do that.Your sin of idolatry is very evident to all. In Twi,you will be told, \"wusuumwubu, dodo. Eye abusumsuum.\"I will appeal to all Christians, including members of the various churches' conference, councils and association, to rise up and condemn you and all those who are using God's Name in vain for personal gains. It is Christ who is being ridiculed here.Blessed be Jesus in the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar, Amen and Thank You.",

    "content": "It has been my pleasure since June of 2021, to work with Kerri Tompkins, auditor, for the elections. She has always been knowledgeable and helpful when I needed guidance.Kerri's strongest assets are her organizing skills. She reorganized the office to run smoother and more efficient elections. In doing this, education and training was maintained for all employees and poll workers. Kerri provided information folders for each precinct to review, if they had question on a certain topic. Training was implemented by using videos and in-person assistance.Technology has improved for the 2024 presidential election. There are touch screen monitors and brand new \"Tenex tablets\" for voting. Touch screens can be used by either the sight or hearing impaired. The tablet streamlines curbside voting. Each tablet has helped the poll workers tremendously with efficient, timely voting with the past June primary election and the September Special Election in Blue Grass. We anticipate that the new \"tablet\" will help immensely with the November presidential election.People are also reading...

    "title": "Opinion | Welcome to the uncanny valley of the 2024 election",
    "content": "Three weeks from Wednesday, every eligible ballot in the 2024 presidential election will have been cast. Election officials will have worked long into the night across the country to tabulate millions of votes. By the morning of Nov. 6, we may finally have an answer to the question those of us who work in, or around, politics have received constantly for months: \"Who's going to win?\"It's unfortunately the one question that nobody can answer with any certainty. There is no clear outcome in sight. There are no debates waiting ahead for Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump to share a stage. And there are no major events to circle on the calendar before the polls open. There is only a seeming eternity ahead for a race that lacks any clear favorite. The uncertainty makes these few remaining weeks particularly maddening, amplifying the smallest potential shift as monumental while leaving little room for the race to be fundamentally altered.In the 1970s, Japanese engineer researcher Masahiro Moti noted that \"in climbing toward the goal of making robots appear human, our affinity for them increases until we come to a valley, which I call the uncanny valley.\" The things that rest in this valley can cause a feeling of deep unease, distress and dismay as our minds struggle to categorize something that comes close to, but falls short of, appearing human.I've come to see this October as the uncanny valley of the election cycle. Stuck between the dynamism of the summer and the surety of November, Americans scour for anything to break the tension. The elusive \"October Surprise\" has accordingly gone from an event that nobody could see coming to a quadrennial prediction that has more often fallen flat, as pundits and politicos hunt for something -- anything -- to shake up the race.Unfortunately, the main balm that we all turn to in these moments isn't as curative as we may want. The latest national poll from NBC News shows Harris and Trump in a \"dead heat,\" with 48% each from registered voters and a margin of error of ±3.1%. On the surface, that seems like a major problem when polling in September showed Harris with a 6-point lead over Trump and the same margin of error.In practice, though, the margin of error means those two poll results aren't as far apart than they seem. Furthermore, these snapshots are our best guesses of how people within a pool of respondents feel right now, but they aren't the predictors that people want them to be. The usefulness of frantically refreshing polling averages is roughly the same as staring into an empty teacup looking for a sign among the leaves.Polls showing a stable race after Harris caught up, then passed Trump once President Joe Biden dropped out should be a comfort to Democrats. But panic is a tried-and-true part of Democratic identity, even when an electoral landslide is just around the corner. These final weeks are always a time of second-guessing, when the candidate's every choice up to that point is re-adjudicated and every sign is a red flag of impending disaster.Unlike the campaigns of her predecessors, Harris' campaign has played out on a condensed timeline, and with that compression comes greater heat and intensity. And so a billion dollars raised since Harris jumped into the race transforms into a potentially worrying sign that donors might not provide needed cash in the final sprint. Decisions on where to spend time and what message to send while there, whom to sit with for interviews, how resources are distributed among allies all become fodder for speculation about why Harris may lose.The sheer amount of noise generated trying to make sense of everything becomes a problem in itself. We're awash in a sea of opinions that are telling Harris she needs to change up her strategy in various contradictory ways before it's too late. These last few weeks are just enough time to turn a ship as big as a presidential campaign, at least in theory, to focus on the One Big Thing that will secure a win. In an election this close, though, there are so many different variables to try to solve for that it can feel impossible to find a formula that denies Trump an electoral victory.The resulting calculus sees Harris' campaign desperately trying to put together a coalition that can remain stable for the next 21 days. How do you both win back Black men who are open to Trump's ham-fisted appeals while also being relatable to the Never Trump Republicans you're wooing? How do you persuade progressives to turn out despite their hesitance over American support for Israel's war in Gaza while also focusing on slowing inflation and driving down consumer prices?I'll let you in on a professional secret here: I don't have an answer to those questions. Even the people doing the work of trying to win this election don't know for sure. These next three weeks are set to be a period of distinct discomfort as we stare into the unknown. There is no quick fix that will calm the vibes and reassure nervous Democrats. Instead, the most powerful thing we can do with an uncomfortable feeling is to acknowledge its sources and work toward the changes we wish to see.",

    "title": "Blaze News original: 10 disgusting, shameful examples of the militant left exacting its will against those in its way",
    "content": "What's the limit of the militant left's violence, bullying, and fascism? It's not likely we've seen its ceiling yet.Blaze News has covered the awful behavior of the militant left for as long as it's been publishing stories, and it doesn't appear it's going anywhere fast.'Off our streets Nazi scum! Off our streets Nazi scum!'As the 2024 presidential election approaches, it's wise to remind ourselves how destructive and dangerous militant leftists can be as we keep trying to get people in office who will stand up to them. In this collection of vignettes, we revisit 10 times the militant left has crossed way over the line.One of the worst was when a violent leftist mob was caught on a viral video following, converging upon, and threatening Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and his wife on a Washington, D.C., street after the 2020 Republican National Convention. \"They were yelling threats. They were trying to push the police over to get to me. They were grabbing at us, and it got worse and worse and worse,\" Paul told Fox News the following day.Then, there was the viral moment when Antifa members were caught on video screaming at a tiny, white-haired woman using a walker, \"Off our streets Nazi scum!\" and blocking her path in a crosswalk outside a conservative event ... and the time when an unhinged leftist was caught on video screaming high-pitched orders at motorists in the middle of a road, \"Do black lives matter to you?!\" One woman doesn't answer correctly -- and things get scary.Remember the shameful moment when two out-of-their-minds females got caught on video ripping up signs supporting then-President Donald Trump and stealing a red \"Make America Great Again\" hat while a 7-year-old boy cried and chased after them with his mother?It may be that the depths to which the militant left will sink knows no bounds. If that's true, we're in for an even bumpier ride for the foreseeable future.A violent leftist mob was caught on video chasing and converging upon Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and his wife on a Washington, D.C., street after the 2020 Republican National Convention outside the White House.Viral video caught the throng of shouting, pushing protesters harassing Paul and his wife as police tried to protect them. The next morning, Paul shared more about what happened: \"Just got attacked by an angry mob of over 100, one block away from the White House. Thank you to @DCPoliceDept for literally saving our lives from a crazed mob.\"Several officers can be heard hollering to the mob to move back as they yell back, \"Say her name!\" in reference to the Louisville police killing of Breonna Taylor. One officer can be seen trying to push back demonstrators with a bicycle, but the mob surges toward the officer, and Paul grabs the officer's arm to prevent him from falling.In an interview the next day, Paul told Fox News, \"They were yelling threats. They were trying to push the police over to get to me. They were grabbing at us, and it got worse and worse and worse.\"Rep. Brian Mast (R-Fla.) said he also was harassed on a D.C. street following the RNC. Mast, a veteran who lost both legs during a 2010 Afghanistan tour, shared video of his encounter and added: \"They thought I would be an easy target because my prosthetics move slowly. They were wrong.\"In the clip, a small, white woman with pigtails angrily asks Mast, \"How do you feel about police killing black people in this country?\" As she and others in the mob get closer to Mast's face, she orders Mast to \"answer the question I am asking you!\" Mast attempts to answer the question several times, but she grows increasingly loud and continues repeating the question -- this time with hand gestures to hammer home her demand. At this point, Mast is completely surrounded by demonstrators who are growing increasingly agitated.Masked left-wing protesters identified as Antifa were caught on video screaming at a tiny, white-haired woman with a walker, \"Off our streets Nazi scum! Off our streets Nazi scum!\" outside a conservative event at a Canadian college on the evening of Sept. 29, 2019.As they blocked the elderly woman's path in a crosswalk, an elderly man accompanying her shot back a retort to the mob, after which one protester screamed at him, \"Don't f***ing touch me! Don't f***ing touch me!\"You can view video here of the jaw-dropping actions.A crowd of about 100 protesters against the event at Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario, stood outside with signs advocating for immigrant rights and yelling chants denouncing those entering, comparing them to Nazis and neo-Nazis, the CBC reported.Supporters of the People's Party -- some wearing \"Make America Great Again\" hats, the iconic symbol of President Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign -- stood behind police and engaged with protesters for about an hour.A scuffle broke out in the crowd, and police led away in handcuffs two men from opposing sides of the protests, the CBC reported. There were four arrests for \"breach of the peace,\" Hamilton police told the outlet, adding that all were later released without conditions.Left-winger Alyssa Milano -- the mostly activist and sometimes actress -- started off her eventful 2020 Memorial Day weekend with a viral, virtue-signaling declaration showing her crocheted COVID face mask and encouraging others to post similar photos. After Milano got mocked into oblivion for her mask's relatively large holes, she lashed out at her critics, calling them \"assholes\" and then saying her mask \"has a filter in it for f***'s sake.\" Uh, charming.Milano was nothing if not on a roll, hopping back on social media on Memorial Day to seemingly praise a mob of shoppers who cursed out and drove off a woman from a supermarket for not wearing a COVID mask: \"Never been prouder of growing up in Staten Island,\" she wrote in reference to the viral video.As you'd expect, plenty of leftists support Milano's tireless activism on their behalf, and they showed it with comments in support for her post. But others blasted her.Regarding the video in question, a number of customers began screaming demands at the maskless woman such as \"Get the f*** out of here!\" and pointing to the store's exit while others were heard hollering, \"Get out!\" and calling her a \"dirty ass pig!\" The woman reportedly left the store.A spokesperson for ShopRite -- where the incident took place -- told CBS News in a statement Monday that store management reported it to authorities. ShopRite added to the network that customers who notice others without face coverings should tell customer service instead of taking matters into their own hands.George Floyd protesters were caught on an absolutely insane video descending upon a Maryland street near Interstate 270 in early June 2020 -- and one unhinged, ultra-confrontational leftist took it upon herself to scream a question at passing cars: \"Do black lives matter to you?!\"One motorist seemed all in and answered affirmatively with his fist raised, so the self-appointed toll booth collector let the driver pass. But one woman made the mistake of completely ignoring the protester's screamed question as she passed by, after which the leftist in a high-pitched holler called her a \"f***in' white piece of s**t!\" and a \"bitch!\" -- and even appeared to challenge her to a fight: \"Oh yeah?! You wanna f***in' go, Karen?!\"Arriving at the driver's window, the protester screamed, \"Until black lives matter, no lives matter!\" The driver made a reference to people of different colors, presumably as a way of communicating that all people are equal and then said to get out of her way. But the screaming protester wasn't having it, hollered back at the woman, then stood in front of her vehicle. Then things got a little scarier.Other protesters joined in the fray and began assembling near the vehicle; \"She ain't goin' nowhere\" a male declared as a protester banged on the hood of the woman's SUV.Either frightened, angry, or both, the driver leaned into her horn for a spell -- but it was no use: \"Whatcha gonna do?\" the same man apparently repeats. \"You're not goin' nowhere.\"Check out the video here.As you might imagine, social users weren't happy with the protesters' tactics, and some made it clear how they would respond if in the same situation:On election night 2020 in Washington, D.C., the usual leftist suspects decked out in Antifa garb surprised no one as they tried to cause as much unrest as possible. But one scene in particular attracted a fair amount of attention on social media.Cell phone video captured a large crowd of leftists filling a street and most of a sidewalk at Black Lives Matter Plaza when a bearded man wearing a white shirt and dark jacket tried to pass by -- but a hooded individual pressed up to the man and wouldn't let him pass.It isn't clear what -- if anything -- the leftist asked, but it appeared as though the smiling, bearded man simply wanted to proceed down the sidewalk with as little trouble as possible, and it seemed like he nodded and said something that ended with \"lives matter.\"With that, the leftist fired a lightning-fast punch to the man's face. The victim tried going after his attacker, but one of the leftist's comrades descended upon and briefly wrestled with the victim -- yet the bearded man still managed to land a couple of punches upon his second opponent. Soon several other leftists in typical leftist fashion ganged up on the victim -- including one who appeared to hit him with what looked like a bat, and upon impact it seemed to resonate with a metallic \"plink.\" Somehow the victim got up and quickly walked away.Soon the victim was seen walking down a street with the assistance of another man who managed to keep at bay the leftist gang that apparently followed from the attack site. Brendan Gutenschwager, the journalist who captured the action, said the victim's head was bleeding. The victim remarked that he was hit in the head with a glass bottle as he and the man who helped him eventually arrived to the safety of a police line.Amid such intense racial strife dominating the headlines, it was powerful to see a black man standing up and helping the injured white victim. This man then confronted the leftist mob by emphasizing in no uncertain terms that the victim is \"a human being.\"\"Y'all think this s**t is cute?\" he told them. \"That man has rights just like everybody else. And throwing s**t at somebody doesn't solve the problem. The election is going on.\"The two Delaware females who were caught on video ripping up signs supporting then-President Donald Trump and stealing a red \"Make America Great Again\" hat while a 7-year-old boy cried and chased after them soon after were indicted on hate crime charges.Olivia Winslow and Camryn Amy -- both 21 and from Wilmington -- on Sept. 8, 2020, were indicted by a New Castle County grand jury on charges of second-degree robbery, second-degree conspiracy, endangering the welfare of a child, third-degree assault, attempted third-degree assault, offensive touching, and felony hate crimes, Delaware Online reported.Three of the seven charges are felonies and collectively are punishable by 15 years in prison, the outlet said, adding that the hate crime charges could lead to the most prison time. Winslow and Amy were released on bail, a spokesman for Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings told Delaware Online. The outlet said it's unclear when they are to be arraigned.The cell phone video -- recorded Aug. 20 near the venue for the virtual Democratic National Convention -- shows two females harassing a mother and her young son. The females ripped pro-Trump signs and stole a MAGA hat sitting near the boy, whose mother recorded the altercation. The boy can be seen running after the females and saying, \"That's somebody else's hat!\" Soon he starts crying. The mom and son followed the females through a parking lot as things heated up.At one point, the boy sees another hat on the ground, and when he goes to retrieve it, one of the females actually appears to stomp her foot to prevent him from picking it up. The video doesn't show whether she makes contact with the boy's hand. But when a man the mom apparently knows attempts to intervene, the same female appears to hit him in the face. Soon she tosses the stolen hat over the fence. The other female then throws part of a ripped sign over a fence as well. The same female who appeared to hit the man in the face and stomped her foot near the boy's hand went after the mom, as the camera seems to show the female taking a swipe at her. Soon the clip ends.As you can probably guess, the court dealt with them leniently. While they were sentenced later in September on misdemeanor charges of theft, child endangerment, and hate crimes, Delaware Online reported that neither of them would go to jail. Instead, Judge Francis J. Jones agreed to the prosecutors' recommendation to sentence the pair to multiple counts of conditional probation.On the 70th night of left-wing protests in Portland, Oregon, over the summer of 2020, rioters decked out in dark clothing and helmets attacked the East Precinct of the city's police on Aug. 6. Amid the rioting and vandalism at the precinct, KOIN-TV reported that officers were hit with projectiles that included glass bottles and rocks -- and cops said one officer was severely injured after taking a large rock to the shoulder.In the middle of all that, the station said an elderly woman who said she lives in the neighborhood pleaded with the group to stop the vandalism and stood in the way of those who were splashing paint on the plywood outside the building.Then, they actually splashed paint on her, too, KOIN noted. But instead of realizing how far out of hand they'd gotten, the violent left-wingers started yelling at the elderly woman: \"This isn't your world anymore!\"When she began yelling back at the rioters, one of them walked over with yellow crime-scene tape and placed it on her before wrapping it around her headAfter the elderly woman hollered at the crowd that \"we died for you!\" the same leftist who wrapped the crime-scene tape around her head -- and towers over her by a foot -- rushed back and got in her face, leaned down, and yelled at her. It's not clear exactly what either of them said, but the elderly woman appeared to tell the rioter that she took part in marching. A female rioter was heard yelling at the elderly woman, \"Put your mask on, bitch! Put your mask on!\" Check out the clip here.The rioters doubled down on their tactics against elderly women at the precinct after noticing one -- using a walker, no less -- was in the process of trying to extinguish a fire in a trash can. But Antifa is nothing if not thorough. KOIN noted that the woman \"was blocked by a person dressed in all black.\"Comrades of the courageous leftist blocking the woman were heard off camera laughing at and mocking her with one finally saying, \"Just let her do it! Let her do it. It's the highlight of her life! C'mon, we wanna see it!\" The rioter ended up moving left and right in front of the woman as she tried to extinguish the fire. As a chant of \"all cops are bastards!\" in the background, the elderly woman with the walker got a shot into the can and put out the fire. Check out the clip here.Surveillance video shows a homeless person on the night of Nov. 4, 2020, curled up on the sidewalk outside the doors of St. Andre Bessette Church in downtown Portland, Oregon. Then, into the camera frame comes a marching group of black-clad Antifa militants. One of them approaches the area where the homeless person is curled up, pays no attention to the individual, and promptly smashes the church's doors and windows.A church leader who filed a police report told officers the church was forced to close its shelter and halt homeless services because staff can't safely open or close the building's extensively damaged doors. St. Andre Bessette serves several hundred people a day, providing shelter, meals, and other services to homeless individuals, police added.\"Until I can get the building secured, everything's coming to a stop,\" Father Tom Gaughan told KGW-TV. \"So there's hundreds of people that we would normally give out food to, and we're not gonna be able to because of this.\" Gaughan added to KOIN-TV that he's also suspending church services, including mass, until the building is secured.\"We ask for everyone's prayers for peace in our streets, which is so long overdue and pray for our sisters and brothers who call the streets and shelters home,\" Gaughan also told KOIN. \"Because the act of one person has prevented us from providing for hundreds of people over the course of a week.\"You can view a video reporter here about the crime.In early 2020, cell phone video showed John Dennis -- chairman of the San Francisco Republican Party -- conversing with a bearded guy who Dennis identified as an Antifa member. The problem, apparently, was that Dennis was running against Democrat Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi in the fall.The Antifa agitator told Dennis -- who was there helping a street cleanup effort -- \"Bruh, I'ma gonna catch you when all the cameras aren't around, and I'm gonna f*** you up.\" And that's just for starters.The bearded guy also told Dennis that \"I want you dead.\" The Republican naturally wondered why.\"Because you're a piece of s**t,\" the Antifa guy told Dennis.Then, when the GOP candidate rightly argued back, asking the bearded guy how he could possibly come to that conclusion, the Antifa guy offered an insight that pretty much sums up the leftist state of mind: \"I can tell by looking at you.\"Dennis posted a video Feb. 4 that offered more insight on what happened between him and the Antifa fellow. Dennis explained that he learned 30 to 40 Antifa members showed up to protest the cleanup effort just because Republicans were involved -- and the guy in the yellow shirt seemed to want to stand out from other Antifa members dressed in dark clothing. He also stood out for other reasons, Dennis added, after flipping over a canopy and threatening various individuals in the crowd. The yellow-shirted Antifa guy seemed to be \"giving backbone\" to the \"rest of the lightweight Antifa,\" Dennis noted.It was at that point that Dennis said he tried talking to the yellow-shirted guy, and then the threats happened. Dennis added that what's not seen on the clip is that he approached the Antifa agitator again and with some \"rough language\" informed him that he wasn't going to be intimidated -- which is when our bearded hero departed and \"the crowd lost a lot of its fight.\" While Dennis said, \"Violence is just unacceptable,\" when push comes to shove and threats are issued, \"You gotta stand up to them.\"Marquise Love -- accused of kicking a man in the head from behind and knocking him out cold after repeatedly punching him amid a Portland protest in August 2020 -- was sentenced to 20 months in prison later in the year, KOIN-TV reported.You can view a video report here showing the head kick.Love received the sentence after pleading guilty to third-degree assault and felony riot as well undergoing \"months of pretrial negotiations and a judicial settlement conference,\" the station said, citing the Multnomah County District Attorney's Office.\nHis guilty plea acknowledges that he caused physical injury to the victim, identified as Adam Haner, and that 'he and others engaged in tumultuous and violent conduct and created a grave risk of causing public alarm.'The DA's office said Haner, as well as law enforcement, the court and the state, found the resolution in this case 'appropriate.' Haner was not personally at the sentencing hearing on Monday, but has previously said in interviews with the media that he hoped Love would learn from what happened.Love apologized to the victim in court, according to the DA's office, and reportedly expressed genuine remorse.After his time behind bars, Love will have to complete 36 months of probation, KOIN reported, adding that any violations could result in additional prison time. He also must undergo an alcohol abuse evaluation and comply with any recommended treatment, the station said.Portland police identified Love as the suspect seen in cell phone videos repeatedly punching a man who was forced by a mob to sit in the street after which the suspect kicked the victim in the head from behind and apparently knocked him out.The beating began after the victim was trying to get away from violent protesters and crashed his truck -- then a mob descended upon him.Haner, recounting the incident to KPTV-TV, said he was yanked out of his vehicle and hit the ground, after which the mob \"wouldn't let me get up\" -- and then the beating began.\"I was just standing for myself as a citizen,\" he told the station, \"and if you can't do that on a street, then what can you do?\"Like Blaze News?

    "title": "Tom Zirpoli: Trump is compromised by relationship with Putin | COMMENTARY",
    "content": "I remember running a nonprofit during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and how frustrating it was not to know if a staff member or a client had COVID when trying to schedule staff to cover our group homes for adults with developmental disabilities. Before we had instant testing for COVID, it was common for us to wait two weeks or more to get a test result from the lab. By then, anyone who was positive had already spread it to others and had likely recovered. In other words, the tests were useless in protecting millions of Americans from a potentially deadly virus.It was disturbing to find out that while America was going through this nightmare and tens of thousands of Americans were dying from COVID each month, the president of the United States, Donald Trump, was reportedly sending advanced testing machines to Russian President Vladimir Putin. These rapid testing machines could have been used here in America to more quickly identify positive cases and help stop the spread of COVID in places like nursing homes and other communities of high-risk populations, like our group homes. However, instead of looking out for his fellow Americans, Trump was looking out for Putin.So much for Trump's \"America First\" campaign.I could overlook this if, for example, Trump was using the testing machines in a trade to secure the release of American hostages held by Putin at the time. But that was not the case. One might be able to overlook Trump's actions if he was using the machines as a negotiating tool to change Putin's aggression toward Ukraine at the time. But that was not the case.These revelations have been reported in Bob Woodward's new book, which also revealed that Trump may have spoken to Putin at least seven times since leaving office. As MSNBC columnist Michael Cohen noted, \"All this was happening at the same time that Trump pushed congressional Republicans to block renewed military assistance for Ukraine.\"Trump consistently promotes policies that benefit Putin. He criticizes NATO as well as U.S. support for Ukraine and our other allies in Europe and beyond. For Putin, Trump is the gift that keeps on giving.As expected, Trump said the story was false, but the Kremlin confirmed Woodward's findings. Like so many other Trump lies, more evidence will likely show him, not Woodward, having trouble with the truth. It sounds like something Trump would do to impress Putin, whom he admires.Besides the obvious issue with this transfer of advanced COVID testing machines to Russia while thousands of Americans were dying, there is also the issue of a likely violation of the U.S. sanctions embargo the United States had at the time following Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea in Ukraine.What did Trump and Putin talk about during those private phone calls after he left office? Was Trump telling Putin how he could help with the 2024 presidential election? No one knows. But Putin knows. National security officials say that if the phone calls took place, Putin has a recording of the conversations. In other words, Trump is significantly compromised as Putin hangs those recordings over his head.Putin isn't the only dictator with whom Trump has had an out-of-office relationship. He has frequently talked with and had meetings with Hungary's self-appointed authoritarian, Viktor Orban, who has called Trump the \"most respected, most feared\" leader in the world. Orban sure knows how to flatter Trump, doesn't he?While Trump praises dictators around the world, he frequently criticizes America, American leaders, the U.S. military, and American allies around the world. Yet, he has nothing but praise for Putin. After Putin invaded Ukraine in 2022, Trump said, \"I'd say that's pretty smart. He's taking over a country -- really a vast, vast location, a great piece of land with lots of people, and just walking right in.\"To date, Trump has not condemned Putin's invasion of one of America's allies. Instead, he saves his condemnation for America and our allies while we try to defend freedom and democracy in Ukraine. All of these behaviors should be red flags to his supporters, but MAGA Republicans don't seem to care that their presidential nominee is a Russian asset.According to Cohen, \"If there is one defining characteristic of Trump's emotional makeup, it is an overweening desire for constant validation -- particularly from men. The fact that Putin 'likes' him is far more important to Trump than the threat the Russian leader represents to American interests, U.S. allies or global stability.\"Putin's most significant concern today is his two-year failing war in Ukraine. Only Trump can save him by getting elected in November, cutting off U.S. aid to Ukraine and allowing Russia to keep the territory it has seized in eastern Ukraine. This move would undercut the security of the United States and our relationship with allies in Europe. It would empower China to invade Taiwan, says William Pomerantz, an analyst at the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. It would send the message to the world that the United States of America is unwilling to defend its allies against Russian aggression and would put all of our allies at risk for future Russian aggression.A vote for Trump in November is a vote for Putin and his continued aggression.",

    "title": "Opinion | Welcome to the uncanny valley of the 2024 election",
    "content": "With less than three weeks until Election Day, the presidential race has entered a period of extremely uncomfortable uncertainty.Three weeks from Wednesday, every eligible ballot in the 2024 presidential election will have been cast. Election officials will have worked long into the night across the country to tabulate millions of votes. By the morning of Nov. 6, we may finally have an answer to the question those of us who work in, or around, politics have received constantly for months: \"Who's going to win?\"It's unfortunately the one question that nobody can answer with any certainty. There is no clear outcome in sight. There are no debates waiting ahead for Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump to share a stage. And there are no major events to circle on the calendar before the polls open. There is only a seeming eternity ahead for a race that lacks any clear favorite. The uncertainty makes these few remaining weeks particularly maddening, amplifying the smallest potential shift as monumental while leaving little room for the race to be fundamentally altered.In the 1970s, Japanese engineer researcher Masahiro Moti noted that \"in climbing toward the goal of making robots appear human, our affinity for them increases until we come to a valley, which I call the uncanny valley.\" The things that rest in this valley can cause a feeling of deep unease, distress and dismay as our minds struggle to categorize something that comes close to, but falls short of, appearing human.I've come to see this October as the uncanny valley of the election cycle. Stuck between the dynamism of the summer and the surety of November, Americans scour for anything to break the tension. The elusive \"October Surprise\" has accordingly gone from an event that nobody could see coming to a quadrennial prediction that has more often fallen flat, as pundits and politicos hunt for something -- anything -- to shake up the race.Unfortunately, the main balm that we all turn to in these moments isn't as curative as we may want. The latest national poll from NBC News shows Harris and Trump in a \"dead heat,\" with 48% each from registered voters and a margin of error of ±3.1%. On the surface, that seems like a major problem when polling in September showed Harris with a 6-point lead over Trump and the same margin of error.In practice, though, the margin of error means those two poll results aren't as far apart than they seem. Furthermore, these snapshots are our best guesses of how people within a pool of respondents feel right now, but they aren't the predictors that people want them to be. The usefulness of frantically refreshing polling averages is roughly the same as staring into an empty teacup looking for a sign among the leaves.Polls showing a stable race after Harris caught up, then passed Trump once President Joe Biden dropped out should be a comfort to Democrats. But panic is a tried-and-true part of Democratic identity, even when an electoral landslide is just around the corner. These final weeks are always a time of second-guessing, when the candidate's every choice up to that point is re-adjudicated and every sign is a red flag of impending disaster.Unlike the campaigns of her predecessors, Harris' campaign has played out on a condensed timeline, and with that compression comes greater heat and intensity. And so a billion dollars raised since Harris jumped into the race transforms into a potentially worrying sign that donors might not provide needed cash in the final sprint. Decisions on where to spend time and what message to send while there, whom to sit with for interviews, how resources are distributed among allies all become fodder for speculation about why Harris may lose.The sheer amount of noise generated trying to make sense of everything becomes a problem in itself. We're awash in a sea of opinions that are telling Harris she needs to change up her strategy in various contradictory ways before it's too late. These last few weeks are just enough time to turn a ship as big as a presidential campaign, at least in theory, to focus on the One Big Thing that will secure a win. In an election this close, though, there are so many different variables to try to solve for that it can feel impossible to find a formula that denies Trump an electoral victory.The resulting calculus sees Harris' campaign desperately trying to put together a coalition that can remain stable for the next 21 days. How do you both win back Black men who are open to Trump's ham-fisted appeals while also being relatable to the Never Trump Republicans you're wooing? How do you persuade progressives to turn out despite their hesitance over American support for Israel's war in Gaza while also focusing on slowing inflation and driving down consumer prices?I'll let you in on a professional secret here: I don't have an answer to those questions. Even the people doing the work of trying to win this election don't know for sure. These next three weeks are set to be a period of distinct discomfort as we stare into the unknown. There is no quick fix that will calm the vibes and reassure nervous Democrats. Instead, the most powerful thing we can do with an uncomfortable feeling is to acknowledge its sources and work toward the changes we wish to see.",

    "content": "'Bruh, I'ma gonna catch you when all the cameras aren't around, and I'm gonna f*** you up ... I want you dead.'What's the limit of the militant left's violence, bullying, and fascism? It's not likely we've seen its ceiling yet.Blaze News has covered the awful behavior of the militant left for as long as it's been publishing stories, and it doesn't appear it's going anywhere fast.'Off our streets Nazi scum! Off our streets Nazi scum!'As the 2024 presidential election approaches, it's wise to remind ourselves how destructive and dangerous militant leftists can be as we keep trying to get people in office who will stand up to them. In this collection of vignettes, we revisit 10 times the militant left has crossed way over the line.One of the worst was when a violent leftist mob was caught on a viral video following, converging upon, and threatening Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and his wife on a Washington, D.C., street after the 2020 Republican National Convention. \"They were yelling threats. They were trying to push the police over to get to me. They were grabbing at us, and it got worse and worse and worse,\" Paul told Fox News the following day.Then, there was the viral moment when Antifa members were caught on video screaming at a tiny, white-haired woman using a walker, \"Off our streets Nazi scum!\" and blocking her path in a crosswalk outside a conservative event ... and the time when an unhinged leftist was caught on video screaming high-pitched orders at motorists in the middle of a road, \"Do black lives matter to you?!\" One woman doesn't answer correctly -- and things get scary.Remember the shameful moment when two out-of-their-minds females got caught on video ripping up signs supporting then-President Donald Trump and stealing a red \"Make America Great Again\" hat while a 7-year-old boy cried and chased after them with his mother?It may be that the depths to which the militant left will sink knows no bounds. If that's true, we're in for an even bumpier ride for the foreseeable future.",

    "title": "Rev. Owusu Bempah, Please Stop This Idolatry - The Ghanaian Chronicle",
    "content": "Rev. Owusu Bempah, for the sake of Jesus Christ, as a Christian who got born again at age ten, may I please advise you to stop this mortal sin of idolatry? You always worship your ego, raising yourself above all, including God, if you do not know. It is only God that we must worship, not humans (Rev. 22: 8-9). Even when Jesus came down to Earth, He never demanded to be worshipped.He who is God, sohumbled Himself to became man and led a humble life as He showed men, the path to salvation. But here you are, together with some self-acclaimed men and women of God, parading yourselves around as if all authority in Heaven and on earth have been given to you, to do whatever you like.Unfortunately, your conducts are rather making a mockery of Christianity, which now seems to be an avenuefor amassing of wealth and fame, instead of amassing souls to Heaven. And by your deeds, any non-Christian who has not read the Bible may think Christianity is a bad religion and Christ is fake. You are doing great injustice to Christianity and this is sinful.And when God-fearing people draw your attention to your false prophecies and your un-Christlike manners, you get mad at them and curse them. True Christians do not do that. Jesus Christ was spat upon, slapped, beaten with whips and finally nailed to the Cross, but He rather pleaded with God to forgive those who did that to Him (Luke 23:34).And Stephen also prayed for forgiveness for those who were killing him (Acts 7:60). Be very careful who you curse. You may curse someone after God's heart and consequences may not be good for you. Seriously, by your deeds are you truly a servant of Godand a follower of Christ?Personally, anddrawing from the knowledge of virtues I get from my Church, the Holy Catholic Church, I do not see the virtue of humility, the foundation of all virtues in you and those self-acclaimed servants of God, who openly attack each other with curses and display of who is more powerful.The Sacred Scriptures teaches me a lot about the true prophets of God and the false ones. The true prophets always say exactly what God tells them, \"Thus says the Lord!\" Whether palatable or not; And areready to die for saying it.The false prophets are always around the politicians, (the kings, etc.) and will always tell them what will please them (Jeremiah 23:9-40; Ezekiel 13.) From what I read about true prophets and false ones, it looks like we have in Ghana, prophets who want to be favoured by politicians and that classifiesthe lot of you,as false prophets.You lot are not doing Christianity any favour by always being divided over what you say are God's prophecies on issues, most especially on who will be the next president. How come the One and Same True God have different opinions when it comes to a simple issue like who will lead the nation?If indeed, God spoke those words, then we may havein one group,the true prophets and in another, the false ones.Over the past three years, you come out strongly with two names who will win the 2024 presidential election. First, you said God has told you that Alan Kyerematen would win both the NPP presidential primary and become our next president in 2025.Unfortunately, Alan did not contest the primary and went on to leave the NPP to run as an independent candidate in the presidential race. So, are you saying God did not know this will happen?Then, you came back to tell us that, God has chosen Mahama to win the presidential election. If this is truly a prophecy from God, then He must tell us why Mahama, since you said in 2020, that God told you, Mahama will never be president again. Or is it because NPP did not give you what you demanded; you have decided to shift to the NDC, hoping to still maintain your title and rank as presidential prophet?Or, you do not want a non-Christian to lead this country? I have to ask these questions, not because I am against Mahama winning, but you are just a confused lot. If Mahama wins, it will be through the daily prayerful intercessions by true and good Christians and non-Christians and also through his total submission to God and his personal relationship with Christ. You have no contribution in this.Now assuming Mahama does not win, what will be your caveat? You will come to say he did not do what you told him to do?So, come out clear and tell us now, what Mahama must do to win this election. So that if evidence shows that he did not do what he was instructed to do and he fails to win, we will believe your prophecy.One of your followers was on television, saying he had a vision of you in the spiritual realm, forcefully taking the sword of governance from Nana Addo. Who does he think he is deceiving? Every body knows that Nana Addo is not contesting elections and had pledged to hand-over to the one who wins the elections, so what is this about him keeping that sword? Come on, we are not children who can easily be deceived. But, why were you appointed to fight him for the sword, when you are not contesting the presidential elections? Stop these jokes.You and some of the prophets are on television prophesying bloody conflicts during and after the 2024 Elections. We have heard all this before. No blood shed will occur during Election 2024. Personnel in our Armed Forces are for the nation and not for any politician, sothey will never allow this to happen.Now, when we come to the issue of humility, none inyour class of modern-day tele-prophets, can score even a grade \"E\". Your pride and arroganceare just too much.Remember the true servants of God and Jesus, Himself were so humble and would never make themselves important even after performing miracles.In 2 Kings 5, is a classic example of how a humble prophet of God should conduct himself. This was about Naaman the Syrian general and Prophet Elisha, who never came to meet the general, to draw attention to himself, but only send down instructions on how he can be healed.And there are occasions when Jesus either directly forbade people He cured from broadcasting about Him or He simply shied away from the scene.If it were you and those others, you will throw yourself around feeling so important and demanding to be adored.Personally, I do not believe you are what you claim to be. You are an embarrassment to Christianity and you must be told this truth.In December 2018, you said God gave you a list of people who would die in 2019, which included the former first lady H.E. Theresa Kufuor, who was 83 years at that time and the National Chief Imam, Shiekh Nuhu Sharubutu who was 99 years, then.When the Muslim youth,stormed your church for further clarifications, you run to the National Chief Imam and went down on all four, like Afia Pokuaa at the Manhyia Palace, and begged for forgiveness, adding that God's prophecy was not correct and the Shiekh was no longer going to die. Either you must be very powerful to be able to halt, whatever God decides to do, or you are fake. I will settle for the latter. Prophets of old, died for proclaiming God's prophecy, but here you are declaring God never spoke well, just to save your skin. That day you made Christianity look fake and a scam.As you are aware, the former First Lady, lived on for almost five more years before departingthis life to eternal glory and the National Chief Imam is now 105 years and still very strong as God keeps blessing him every day.Some education for you, when God says to someone, he is to die, it means the person's soul will perish in hell (2 Kings 20: 1-4 and the Book of Jonah). When someone is to die and gain eternal life in Heaven, God will say, \"today, you will be with Me in Paradise.\"(Luke 23:42-43). These words from Jesus to the dying Dismas, the repentant armed robber, saved his soul.Another thing that you should be aware of, prophecies which are about someone, are to be told directly to them and not proclaimed publicly. Prophet Nathan's encounter with King David is a classic example, (2 Samuel 12:1-25). Verse 1, is clear:\"God sent Nathan to David...\" God did not send Nathan to the public square. David could have been dethroned if what he did went public. But you always go public with people's prophecies. A real prophet will never do that.Your sin of idolatry is very evident to all. In Twi,you will be told, \"wusuumwubu, dodo. Eye abusumsuum.\"I will appeal to all Christians, including members of the various churches' conference, councils and association, to rise up and condemn you and all those who are using God's Name in vain for personal gains. It is Christ who is being ridiculed here.Blessed be Jesus in the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar, Amen and Thank You.",

    "title": "The 44-year-old novice politician hoping to truly 'retire' 60+ year-olds",
    "content": "The last time someone in his forties was president of Ghana, was in 1992, when the late former Head of State, Flt. Lt, Jerry John Rawlings, became the first president of the fourth republic of Ghana.As a young 45-year-old Airforce soldier-pilot, he left his mark as a force to be reckoned with, giving Ghana its most stable republic since independence in 1957, but since then, not so many people in that age bracket have been successful at becoming Head of State.But there is a young, daring, and ambitious man who is confident that with all the work that he has done, being able to rally the youth behind his vision, he can give Ghana its next youthful president.Nana Kwame Bediako, popularly known as Cheddar or Freedom Jacob Caesar, is the brain behind the New Force Movement and he is confident he can cause a major shake in the political landscape of Ghana on December 7, 2024, when the nation goes to the polls.Seated at Number 12 on the ballot papers, Cheddar ultimately wants to work towards a United States of Africa, with a cooked-up plan of a $50,000 Citizenship by Investment program aimed at raising a whopping $50 billion for Ghana's economy.The 44-year-old is also convinced that he is the man to actually retire all the 60+ candidates in the race, regardless of the fact that these same 'retirees' head the biggest political parties in Ghana; the same two parties that have ruled Ghana since the dawn of the fourth republic.But what is Cheddar's vision for Ghana?On September 1, 2024, the leader of the New Force Movement, Nana Kwame Bediako, launched his manifesto for the 2024 presidential election.The manifesto, dubbed '12 Pillars for Economic Freedom,' detailed Cheddar's policies and plans to help Ghana get out of its current hardships and eventually achieve economic liberation.They are:Run a government of only 12 ministersCheddar promised to run the leanest government in Ghana's history with only 12 ministers if elected president on December 7, 2024.His 'Apostolic Government' would have the following ministries: Finance, Trade, Education, Agriculture, Foreign Affairs, Interior, Sports and Business Development, Health, Justice, Energy, Business and Employment, Defence, and Tourism. he stated.Raise $50 billion by monetising Ghanaian citizenshipThe presidential hopeful also indicated that the major source of funds for his government would be selling Ghanaian citizenship.He indicated that this would help the country raise $50 billion, which would be a solution to Ghana's problems.He explained that his government would come up with an immigration package to monetise Ghana's citizenship.This initiative, he also indicated, would be the starting point of having a United States of Africa.\"We  will be the first people to start the project USA - United States of Africa, by people joining us  and we welcoming them through our borders but also, they will also be investing on our land.\"Ghana would print its own currencyHe also pledged to move the country away from engaging foreign countries when it comes to printing currency notes if given the nod in the pending presidential elections.He argued that Ghana does not need to source the printing of its currency to firms operating in countries like Switzerland, Belarus, England, and others.\"What happens to the industrial power that we are creating now? We are going to print money on our own. We don't need to go to America or England to print money.\"We don't need to go anywhere else to buy food and bring it here. We don't need to pay seven times the taxes of what is already in our country, packaged by someone else at a premium price, and bring it back here.

The National Sovereign Wealth Fund is the new IMF, independent and autonomous. It will collect every reserve and will keep it and protect it.\"Construct Ghana's first water transportationCheddar also proposed the creation of a water transport system as a solution to Ghana's transport system.This, he believes, would help expand the country's transport system and allow for ease and cheaper transportation of persons, goods, and services.His other objective for the transport sector would be to construct an 8000KM railway line across the country.Build a food reserve to serve Ghana for the next 100 yearsThe founder of the New Force also stated that his government, under an 'Agro Reserves' programme, would capitalise on the arable lands of the country to establish the biggest seedling bank.He indicated that this would help Ghana in terms of food security for 100 years and be able to also supply to the world.\"We intend to build the biggest seedling bank and have food security for 100 years.

    "content": "Donald Trump biopic 'The Apprentice' has hit the theatres weeks ahead of US presidential elections. The biopic shows the journey of ex US President Donald Trump's rise to real estate fame in 1970s New York. However, the movie has sparked a controversy as it reportedly shows a scene where Trump reportedly sexually assaults his ex-wife Ivana Trump. He has criticized the filmmakers by calling the 'The Apprentice' \"fake and classless\". Weeks before a nail-biting high-stakes US presidential elections, director Ali Abbasi has dropped a cinematic grenade into theaters- Donald Trump's biopic \"The Apprentice\". The Apprentice, which opened in theaters over the weekend, reflects on the journey of Trump as a real estate businessman in New York in the 1970s and 1980s.Former President Donald Trump has strongly criticized his newly released biopic The Apprentice, calling it \"fake, classless and a politically disgusting hatchet job.\" Trump has also hit out at the makers as the movie reportedly includes a scene of him sexually assaulting his ex-wife Ivana Trump.Trump broke his silence amidst shocking allegations of sexually assaulting his ex-wife Ivana, who passed away in 2022. The former US President praised his late ex-wife, Ivana as a \"kind and wonderful person\" and said he had a great relationship with her.ALSO READ: Controversial Trump biopic 'The Apprentice' hits US theaters amid legal threats, he calls it pure 'garbage'Trump claims the film, written by political journalist Gabriel Sherman, is defamatory and a political attack ahead of the 2024 election.According to a report in USA Today, in one of the scenes of the movie, Trump tells Ivana that he is no longer attracted to her to which she replies that he is fat and balding. Following this, Donald Trump throws her on the floor, climbs on top of her, proceeding to sexually assault his wife as she screams for him to stop, the report says.The alleged rape is taken from a court deposition \"that Ivana gave under oath during her 1990 divorce,\" Gabriel Sherman says. \"In fact, the scene she described in the divorce papers was actually far more graphic and brutal than the one we dramatized in the film.\" Ivana later recanted her rape allegation in 2015 amid his first presidential campaign.The scene has created an uproar with Trump intimidating the filmmakers with a cease-and-desist letter trying to block the movie's release.ALSO READ: The Apprentice: Where to watch Donald Trump's movie on streaming?Donald Trump, locked in neck-and-neck fight with Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, has blasted the filmmakers on Truth Social, questioning the creators' rights to use that name without approval.\"It's a cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country, \"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" he wrote.\"The writer of this pile of garbage, Gabe Sherman, a lowlife and talentless hack, who has long been widely discredited, knew that, but chose to ignore it,\" he continued.\"So sad that HUMAN SCUM, like the people involved in this hopefully unsuccessful enterprise, are allowed to say and do whatever they want in order to hurt a Political Movement, which is far bigger than any of us,\" the ex-President concluded.However, according to the film's writer, the scene that Ivana narrated in her divorce papers was \"actually far more graphic and brutal than the one we dramatized in the film.\"",

    "content": "Kamala Harris is leading Donald Trump in the race to win the 2024 US presidential election, according to the latest poll of polls.However, the contest remains too close to call in the crucial battleground states that will decide who is the next president.On this page you will find the latest national and state polls to see how the two candidates are faring ahead of the November 5th election.National polling averages show Harris gaining on Trump after US president Joe Biden dramatically dropped out of the race on July 20th.The US vice president currently has a more than two-point lead over her Republican rival, according to averages by polling analysis website 538, which is part of American news network ABC News.However, national polls are merely indicators in US presidential elections, because the overall winner is decided using the winner-takes-all electoral college system.Each state is given a number of electoral college votes roughly in line with the size of its population. The candidate who wins the most votes in a state takes all the electoral college votes in that state.A total of 538 electoral college votes are up for grabs, so a candidate needs to reach 270 to win.It is possible for a president to win the electoral college while losing the popular vote - as happened with George W Bush in 2000 and Trump in 2016.Because many states vote dependably for Democrats or Republicans in presidential elections, the outcome usually rests on a handful of states where the election is truly competitive.Polls show Trump and Harris are neck and neck in the seven so-called swing states: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina.With 19 electoral votes, Pennsylvania is the biggest prize among the battleground states.Harris currently has a slight lead over Trump in Pennsylvania, according to the latest polling averages, though well within the margin of error.If Harris won every state where she currently leads in the polling averages, she would reach the necessary 270 electoral votes.That outcome is far from certain. Trump could easily take the presidency again if he gains ground in swing states - or if the polls are underestimating his support, as happened in the run-up to the 2016 and 2020 elections.The polls do seem to agree on one point: the US is heading for another closely contested presidential election.",

    "content": "GhanaWeb Feature by Etsey AtisuThe last time someone in his forties was president of Ghana, was in 1992, when the late former Head of State, Flt. Lt, Jerry John Rawlings, became the first president of the fourth republic of Ghana.As a young 45-year-old Airforce soldier-pilot, he left his mark as a force to be reckoned with, giving Ghana its most stable republic since independence in 1957, but since then, not so many people in that age bracket have been successful at becoming Head of State.But there is a young, daring, and ambitious man who is confident that with all the work that he has done, being able to rally the youth behind his vision, he can give Ghana its next youthful president.Nana Kwame Bediako, popularly known as Cheddar or Freedom Jacob Caesar, is the brain behind the New Force Movement and he is confident he can cause a major shake in the political landscape of Ghana on December 7, 2024, when the nation goes to the polls.Seated at Number 12 on the ballot papers, Cheddar ultimately wants to work towards a United States of Africa, with a cooked-up plan of a $50,000 Citizenship by Investment program aimed at raising a whopping $50 billion for Ghana's economy.The 44-year-old is also convinced that he is the man to actually retire all the 60+ candidates in the race, regardless of the fact that these same 'retirees' head the biggest political parties in Ghana; the same two parties that have ruled Ghana since the dawn of the fourth republic.But what is Cheddar's vision for Ghana?On September 1, 2024, the leader of the New Force Movement, Nana Kwame Bediako, launched his manifesto for the 2024 presidential election.The manifesto, dubbed '12 Pillars for Economic Freedom,' detailed Cheddar's policies and plans to help Ghana get out of its current hardships and eventually achieve economic liberation.They are:Run a government of only 12 ministersCheddar promised to run the leanest government in Ghana's history with only 12 ministers if elected president on December 7, 2024.His 'Apostolic Government' would have the following ministries: Finance, Trade, Education, Agriculture, Foreign Affairs, Interior, Sports and Business Development, Health, Justice, Energy, Business and Employment, Defence, and Tourism. he stated.Raise $50 billion by monetising Ghanaian citizenshipThe presidential hopeful also indicated that the major source of funds for his government would be selling Ghanaian citizenship.He indicated that this would help the country raise $50 billion, which would be a solution to Ghana's problems.He explained that his government would come up with an immigration package to monetise Ghana's citizenship.This initiative, he also indicated, would be the starting point of having a United States of Africa.\"We  will be the first people to start the project USA - United States of Africa, by people joining us  and we welcoming them through our borders but also, they will also be investing on our land.\"Ghana would print its own currencyHe also pledged to move the country away from engaging foreign countries when it comes to printing currency notes if given the nod in the pending presidential elections.He argued that Ghana does not need to source the printing of its currency to firms operating in countries like Switzerland, Belarus, England, and others.\"What happens to the industrial power that we are creating now? We are going to print money on our own. We don't need to go to America or England to print money.\"We don't need to go anywhere else to buy food and bring it here. We don't need to pay seven times the taxes of what is already in our country, packaged by someone else at a premium price, and bring it back here. That stops because we are going to create them here,\" Nana Kwame Bediako said.Change SSNIT into National Insurance FundThe leader of the New Force also promised to change the Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT) to the National Insurance Fund.Under the National Insurance Fund, he said contributors can go for their monies at any time.Establish a National Sovereign Wealth Fund, the new IMFCheddar also stated that he would establish a National Sovereign Wealth Fund which would help the country stop borrowing and free it from the International Monetary Fund.\"We are going to create the National Sovereign Wealth Fund; this is the new IMF.

    "content": "The US National Retail Federation (NRF) has projected an increase in 2024 winter holiday sales between 2.5% and 3.5% compared with the previous year.This is expected to result in total holiday spending between $979.5bn and $989bn in November and December, up from $955.6bn in the same period of 2023.According to data from the US Census Bureau compiled by the NRF, core retail sales in the US during the 2023 holiday season rose 3.8% to $964.4bn.NRF president and CEO Matthew Shay said: \"The economy remains fundamentally healthy and continues to maintain its momentum heading into the final months of the year.\"The winter holidays are an important tradition to American families, and their capacity to spend will continue to be supported by a strong job market and wage growth.\"The retail trade association expects a significant portion of retail sales growth to come from online shopping.Online and other non-store sales are anticipated to reach between $295.1bn and $297.9bn in 2024, resulting in an 8% to 9% increase over $273.3bn in the same period of the previous year.The 2024 shopping period between Thanksgiving and Christmas will be five days shorter than in 2023, at 26 days.NRF also expects the economic impact of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, and the 2024 US presidential election, to impact sales.NRF chief economist Jack Kleinhenz said: \"We remain optimistic about the pace of economic activity and growth projected in the second half of the year.\"Household finances are in good shape and an impetus for strong spending heading into the holiday season, though households will spend more cautiously.\"The NRF also forecasts that retailers will hire between 400,000 and 500,000 seasonal workers in 2024, compared with 509,000 the year before.Retail chain Target recently revealed plans to hire 100,000 seasonal workers.\"US winter holiday sales forecast to increase up to 3.5% YoY\" was originally created and published by Retail Insight Network, a GlobalData owned brand.",

    "title": "NRF forecasts 'steady' holiday sales growth on strong consumer confidence - Just Style",
    "content": "According to NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay, the US economy remains fundamentally healthy and continues to maintain its momentum heading into the final months of the year.Shay emphasised that winter holidays are an \"important tradition\" to American families, and their capacity to spend will continue to be supported by a strong job market and wage growth.NRF noted that the holiday forecast is consistent with its forecast that annual sales for 2024 will be between 2.5% and 3.5% over 2023 levels.A key driver of this overall retail sales growth is expected to come from online shopping, with non-store and online sales expected to rise between 8% and 9%, reaching a total of $295.1bn to $297.9bn, up from $273.3bn last year. NRF said this figure reflects a more moderate increase compared to last year's 10.7% growth in non-store sales.NRF chief economist Jack Kleinhenz also expressed optimism about the financial health of American households, stating it is in \"good shape and an impetus\" for strong spending heading into the holiday season.However, he cautioned that consumers are likely to be more deliberate in their purchases: \"We remain optimistic about the pace of economic activity and growth projected in the second half of the year.\"Retailers are preparing for increased consumer demand during the holiday season, with the NRF predicting that between 400,000 and 500,000 seasonal workers will be hired this year, down slightly from the 509,000 hires in 2023. Some hiring may have already occurred in October to support early holiday shopping events.NRF said that one differentiating characteristic from last year's holiday shopping season is that the shopping period between Thanksgiving and Christmas will be six days shorter, totalling 26 days.Additionally, NRF noted that contributing factors this year could include the economic impact of Hurricanes Helene and Milton; even though the 2024 US presidential election will take place during the winter holiday season, it is nearly impossible to measure its impact on current or future spending.NRF said, its holiday forecast is based on economic modelling using various key economic indicators including consumer spending, disposable personal income, employment, wages, inflation and previous monthly retail sales releases.In April, Kleinhenz projected that the US economy would remain steady through 2024, despite a slowdown in both gross domestic product (GDP) and retail sales growth.",

    "title": "Special Forces Raid Pro-Russian Bloc Office in Moldova Ahead of Elections - https://eutoday.net",
    "content": "On the morning of 16 October 2024, special forces in Moldova conducted a raid on the offices of the pro-Russian political bloc \"Victory\" in the city of Bălți. The bloc, closely tied to fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor, has been under scrutiny for alleged involvement in election fraud and illegal party financing ahead of the upcoming presidential elections and referendum on 20 October. The raid involved five buses of special forces, and police have confirmed the operation as part of ongoing investigations.The raid was reportedly initiated by Moldova's National Investigation Inspectorate and the Prosecutor's Office. These authorities are investigating possible attempts to rig the election and referendum scheduled for later this month. The police spokesperson, Diana Fetco, confirmed that searches were being conducted in Bălți but noted that more detailed information would be provided once the operation concluded.The \"Victory\" bloc was established in Moscow in April 2024 and is comprised of five political parties, all of which are connected to Ilan Shor. Shor's own party, also named after him, was declared illegal in Moldova, yet a duplicate party, \"Chance,\" along with \"Renaissance,\" \"Alternative Force for the Salvation of Moldova,\" and \"Victorie\" (\"Victory\"), continue to operate under his influence. The central role Shor's party plays in this alliance has drawn significant attention from both Moldovan authorities and international observers.In August 2024, Moldova's Central Election Commission (CEC) denied the Victory bloc registration for the upcoming elections. The CEC cited two main reasons: the bloc's name was similar to that of one of its constituent parties, and the inclusion of the banned \"Shor\" party within the bloc was illegal under Moldovan law.The scrutiny of the Victory bloc has intensified in the lead-up to the elections. Earlier this year, law enforcement agencies conducted raids on the homes and offices of individuals associated with another of the bloc's constituent parties, \"Renaissance.\" These investigations were focused on allegations of voter bribery and illegal financing of political activities.The latest raid follows growing concerns over voter manipulation. Last week, a journalistic investigation aired on several major Moldovan television channels, alleging that Ilan Shor's political apparatus has been bribing voters. According to the investigation, participants in the bloc's campaign events were offered cash incentives, reportedly paid in Russian rubles, to engage in electoral activities and public demonstrations.Authorities have been tightening their scrutiny of Shor's network. Just last week, three individuals were detained following over 100 searches related to suspected illegal party financing and voter bribery. The arrests are part of a wider investigation into the activities of the oligarch's political machine, which is accused of using illicit financial means to influence the outcome of the election.The October 2024 presidential election in Moldova is taking place amid heightened political tensions. The pro-Russian Victory bloc represents a direct challenge to the government of President Maia Sandu, who has pursued a pro-European Union agenda since taking office. Moldova's political landscape has been sharply divided between pro-European and pro-Russian factions, with the Victory bloc positioned as a key player for the latter.The involvement of Ilan Shor, a fugitive convicted of fraud in connection with the infamous \"theft of the century\" -- the embezzlement of $1 billion from Moldovan banks in 2014 -- has cast a long shadow over the bloc. Shor fled Moldova in 2019 and has since been residing in Israel, continuing to exert influence over Moldovan politics through his party and associated groups.The Victory bloc's formation in Moscow and its ties to Russian political and financial interests have only intensified concerns that foreign interference could influence Moldova's electoral process. The bloc's pro-Russian stance aligns with Moscow's strategic interests in the region, particularly as Moldova's leadership continues to forge closer ties with the European Union and NATO.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON (7News) -- Preparations for Inauguration Day have begun in D.C. much earlier than usual. 7News is looking into why riot fencing and barriers are already up around the White House.Law enforcement sources told Reporter John Gonzalez there are more security concerns this election year. Outside of the White House, security measures are already visible nearly 100 days before the inauguration.The Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) generally begins prep work and logistics well ahead of the inauguration but putting up riot fencing three weeks before the election is very telling. 10-foot fencing and concrete barriers now surround Lafayette Park.The National Park Service (NPS) said the closures and fencing are in place to make it easier for building materials to be delivered and heavy machinery to be stored. Law enforcement sources told 7News that election day three weeks away is a big factor this year, and officials are concerned that the period between Election Day and Inauguration Day could be extraordinarily tense.MPD is considering going to what's called Alpha Bravo 12-hour days starting before the election and continuing through inauguration day. There is also talk in the department about canceling days off during the Election and Inauguration weeks, but nothing is confirmed yet.READ MORE | Heightened security expected during vote count for 2024 presidential election: DHSAnother law enforcement source said police agencies in the city want security measures in place before the election results are in.Security and terrorism specialist Jim Ortte said regardless of the winner, protests are highly likely, and terrorism fears are real this fall because of all the world events.\"One of the first times it's been in October and you have to question why is that? And normally there's protest on both sides, no matter who wins, there's going to be some type of protest. But with the world events, to me that's more concerning. You've had three attempts against the former president who is now running for president,\" said Ortte. \"I suspect that's why they're building the security early. There are benefits because then it gives the authorities more time to do investigative and observation techniques. Also, they can study their own design of the barrier and see if they have any lapses.\" According to an NPS release, work for the presidential inauguration typically begins in November, but this year, preparation began early \"to accommodate additional time needed for a safer and more secure environment for construction activities.\"Parade stands are also going up and Pennsylvania Avenue is being repaved.7News has learned this fencing will be around until February.",

    "content": "Trump criticises 'The Apprentice,' calls it politically motivated and defamatoryDonald Trump has made it clear he disapproves of Ali Abbasi's film, The Apprentice. Sebastian Stan stars as Trump in this drama set in the 1970s and 1980s, chronicling Trump's rise in New York's real estate scene and his relationship with lawyer Roy Cohn, played by Jeremy Strong.The film premiered at Cannes earlier this year and now holds a 79 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Critics have given mixed reviews, but the Trump campaign has been outspoken in its criticism. Spokesperson Steven Cheung threatened legal action in May, calling the film 'garbage' and 'pure fiction that sensationalises debunked lies.'Though Trump remained silent for a while, he recently expressed his opinions on the film's theatrical release this week. Writing on Truth Social, he called it a \"FAKE and CLASSLESS Movie\" and questioned whether the filmmakers had the right to use the name The Apprentice. He hoped it would 'bomb' at the box office.He described the film as a \"cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job,\" released strategically before the 2024 Presidential Election to harm his political movement.Trump also criticised the film's portrayal of his relationship with his former wife, Ivana Trump, played by Maria Bakalova. He stated, \"Ivana was a kind and wonderful person, and we had a great relationship until she died. Gabe Sherman, the writer of this garbage, is a discredited hack who chose to ignore the truth.\"He concluded his rant by calling those involved in the film \"HUMAN SCUM\" and insisted they aim to damage a political movement larger than any individual.Director Ali Abbasi addressed the controversy and backlash from the Trump campaign back in May. He said he didn't think Trump would necessarily dislike the film, but he believed Trump might be surprised by it. Abbasi mentioned he would be happy to meet Trump for a screening and discuss it afterward.",

In comparison, Morningstar DBRS forecasts the upper range of losses to reach $60 billion.According to Morningstar, that amount includes flood claims, which are expected to cost the National Flood Insurance Program $10 billion.According to the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, the insured losses for claims filed as of Oct. 14 were $1.54 billion for Milton and $1.2 billion for Helene.The impact of back-to-back hurricanes in the densely populated Tampa Bay region will take time to come into focus. Still, analysts expect the storms to exhaust property insurers' catastrophe budgets this year. Some have raised concerns about the resiliency of relatively smaller regional carriers whose business is concentrated in Florida.According to Moody's, Florida-concentrated insurers account for approximately 50% of the state's property insurance market. Excluding state-backed Citizens Property Insurance Corp., regional carriers account for a significant portion of the policies in the seven-county Tampa Bay region. According to FLOIR data, the five largest insurers behind Citizens hold roughly 185,000 policies, amounting to $27.3 billion in exposure.Losses in the reinsurance market -- a linchpin of the Florida market's overall stability -- may undo much of the progress toward price stability. Significant losses may drive up rates in upcoming renewal cycles to rebuild sufficient capacity and the knock-on effect is higher costs for consumers.___\"Incoming Duval School Board member criticized for sharing hurricane conspiracies\" via Megan Mallicoat of Jacksonville Today -- As federal officials have been trying to combat the spread of weather-related conspiracy theories on social media, a soon-to-be Duval School Board member has been among the elected officials pushing the claim that the government can manipulate the weather.Between Hurricane Helene's landfall in Florida's Big Bend and Milton's arrival two weeks later, recently elected District 1 School Board member Tony Ricardo made over 90 hurricane-related posts, dozens of them including misinformation or censored by Facebook fact-checkers.None included information about Jacksonville storm resources, such as the hurricane shelter opened at Arlington Middle School in his district.Ricardo's posts aren't unique. A Broward County School Board member made similar social media posts. And Marjorie Taylor Greene, the bombastic GOP Congresswoman from Georgia known for her far-right stances, made national news with her own wildly inaccurate posts.\"Social media is a mirror, right? It allows us to see crazy stuff that people believe -- and they probably always believed -- but now they say it out loud in a different way,\" says Adam Enders, a political-science professor at the University of Louisville whose peer-reviewed research focuses on conspiracy theories and how they spread.Research shows that, if anything, people are less conspiratorial today than in decades past, he says. But social media does make it easier to spread misinformation.\"This is a way for people to express their opinions about things in a new way that isn't exactly like in a vacuum,\" Enders says. \"But it's different from saying it to somebody else's face, right? And I think that allows people to express ideas that are counter to norms.\"When constituents pushed back, though, Ricardo doubled down.\"Maybe folks would be better served by doing just a little 'research,'\" he wrote in one Facebook post. In another, he called commenters \"historically challenged.\"Jimmy Patronis activates 'Operation Blue Roof' for storm-impacted counties -- Chief Financial Officer Patronis is teaming up with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on \"Operation Blue Roof\" following Hurricanes Helene and Milton, which ripped through the state in late September and early October. \"The purpose of Operation Blue Roof is to provide homeowners and permanently occupied rental properties in disaster areas with fiber-reinforced sheeting to cover their damaged roofs until arrangements can be made for permanent repairs. This is a free service to homeowners,\" a news release from Patronis' office said. Florida counties that qualify for Operation Blue Roof include Brevard, Citrus, Charlotte, DeSoto, Hardee, Hernando, Highlands, Hillsborough, Indian River, Lake, Manatee, Okeechobee, Orange, Osceola, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Lucie, Sumter and Volusia. Applications for Operation Blue Roof are being accepted through Nov. 5 at the Army Corps designated website.\"Ron DeSantis boasts of 'zero tolerance' for storm looters, animal abusers\" via A.G. Gancarski of Florida Politics -- DeSantis says the state and subsidiary agencies have \"upheld\" their \"commitment\" to punish looters who would exploit the tragedy of Milton. \"If you loot, we're going to hold you accountable,\" DeSantis said, noting that around the state, law enforcement has had to deal with malingerers and malefactors trying to take advantage of the crisis. \"It's been a commitment that's been upheld across all state agencies, whether it's our Highway Patrol, Florida Department of Law Enforcement, whether it's the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, who got somebody trying to take a generator away from a power light, or Daytona Beach arresting people for looting,\" DeSantis said.\"Hurricane season takes a major toll on coastal communities in Manatee, Sarasota counties\" via Henry Queen of the Tampa Bay Business Journal -- Helene and Milton hit Waterfront communities in Manatee and Sarasota counties hard. Access to the barrier islands has been restored, but the beaches are closed. The economy along the Gulf of Mexico centers around tourism, and it's too early to estimate when the beaches will reopen to visitors. Every hotel, short-term rental restaurant and other business will be different, but the holiday season will likely be severely impacted. The Rod and Reel Pier on Anna Maria Island was destroyed. Helene caused significant damage, but the restaurant at the pier's end was still standing. Milton then removed it. Supporters of the pier, which opened in 1947, launched a GoFundMe for the rebuilding effort with a $300,000 fundraising goal. The city pier's walkway in Anna Maria also suffered significant damage, but the building still stands. As of Oct. 14, the curfew in Anna Maria has been lifted.\"A climate-resistant community passed two hurricane tests\" via Austyn Gaffney of The New York Times -- As Milton rushed ashore, at least 2,000 Floridians found a haven at Babcock Ranch, a community the size of Manhattan that opened in 2018 to withstand climate-driven storms. Evacuees spread across two buildings designated as shelters by the Florida Division of Emergency Management: a K-12 school held about 400 people and a 40,000-square-foot sports facility housed about 1,600 more. Many fled from Fort Myers, a coastal city about 15 miles to the southwest, where residents were under a mandatory evacuation order. \"When Gov. DeSantis made the announcement that Babcock Ranch was open, we saw a very big surge in evacuees,\" said Syd Kitson, the town's co-founder, who estimated that hundreds more evacuees sheltered in private homes of the town's roughly 10,000 residents. \"It saved a lot of lives in some really dangerous areas.\"\"Like Hurricane Ian in 2022, Milton will keep St. Johns River high for weeks\" via David Bauerlein of The Florida Times-Union -- Milton's destructive force has gone out to sea, but in a repeat of what happened after Ian in 2022, the spillover of the storm will continue for weeks along the St. Johns River because daily high tides combined with the rain-swollen river will continue flooding in low-lying areas. Milton dumped a swath of 10 to 20 inches of rain along the Interstate 4 corridor through Central Florida, similar to what Ian did two years ago, said Ben Nelson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Jacksonville. \"That's going to take a long time to filter through the St. Johns River, which is a slow-moving river to begin with,\" Nelson said.\"'We can't get no relief': On Lake Bonny in Lakeland, Milton brings unprecedented flooding\" via Sara-Megan Walsh of the Lakeland Ledger -- Lakeland resident Mike Coker and his wife stood on the front corner of their property, mere feet from passing traffic on Longfellow Boulevard, talking to a family friend. It's the only spot that wasn't underwater. Rain from Milton has poured into Lake Bonny, causing the lake's edge to creep forward roughly 350 feet to lap at the east side of Longfellow Boulevard. Coker said he's spotted fish swimming through his front yard. \"All the water is still coming up; the water level is still rising,\" Coker said. Coker and his wife said they've lived in east Lakeland for almost 50 years and have never seen Lake Bonny flood like this.\"Local rescue group saves lives in Milton's aftermath\" via Mark Parker of the St. Pete Catalyst -- Over the past three weeks, a local organization dedicated to rescuing the unreachable potentially saved dozens of lives around Tampa Bay and Asheville, North Carolina. Tampa-based Grey Bull Rescue specializes in quickly reaching American citizens trapped in conflict and disaster zones. The nonprofit's special operations (SpecOps) and support teams mobilized around the area before heading to Appalachia during Helene. Personnel returned home as Milton set its sights on Tampa Bay. Founder Bryan Stern, also a combat veteran and Purple Heart recipient, left Beirut, Lebanon, after rescuing a child facing imminent danger from Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed terrorist organization.\"Kamala Harris slams Donald Trump as 'unhinged' as they trade attacks in Pennsylvania\" via Maeve Reston and Marianne LeVine of The Washington Post -- Harris portrayed Trump as dangerous and \"unhinged\" at a rally, arguing that the Supreme Court's decision granting Presidents broad immunity for their official acts has significantly raised the stakes for a second Trump presidency. Trying out a new tactic here in Western Pennsylvania, Harris ordered her aides to roll the tape on giant jumbotron screens inside the Erie rally hall to show clips of Trump making inflammatory statements and threats at his rallies and in a recent interview. Watching the former President speak, many in the crowd booed and some shouted, \"He's a criminal!\" Harris argued that Americans should be alarmed that Trump has threatened to jail his opponents.\"As Black voters hesitate on Harris, Democrats race to win them over\" via Maya King, Katie Rogers, Clyde McGrady and Erica L. Green of The New York Times -- In Atlanta, a group of Black entertainers and elected officials took the stage at a brewery to urge a crowd of Black men to support Harris. In Milwaukee, dozens of volunteers fanned out across Black neighborhoods to encourage sometimes skeptical residents to vote. And in a blitz of national media interviews and campaign ads, Harris made her case to Black voters. The flood of recent door-knocking, ads, rallies and celebrity-studded outreach events across battleground states reflects Democrats' growing alarm about their weakening support among Black voters -- a yearslong drift that the party's leaders have not confronted so directly, and with the stakes so high, until now.\"Trump rails about 'The Apprentice' movie; Director Ali Abbasi tells Ex-POTUS, 'I'm available to talk further if you want'\" via Ted Johnson of Deadline -- In middle-of-the-night Truth Social post, Trump weighed in on the movie \"The Apprentice,\" unsurprisingly calling it a \"cheap, defamatory and politically disgusting hatchet job.\" Back in May, Trump had threatened to sue over the movie, with his attorneys filing a cease-and-desist demand. That may have delayed the ability of the producers to obtain a distributor, but once they did, Trump and his team have yet to file any litigation. The Apprentice tells of the early days of Trump in 1970s and '80s Manhattan, where Roy Cohn teaches his \"apprentice\" how to fight back against a federal lawsuit alleging that Trump and his father engaged in discrimination against Black applicants seeking to rent housing from them.Sen. Rick Scott holds 'Veterans for Rick Scott' GOTV rally in Miami -- Scott was joined by U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan and members of the \"Veterans for Rick Scott\" coalition at Vladamir Laminates to support his re-election campaign. If re-elected, Scott says he will continue \"working to make Florida the best state for military members, veterans and their families to live, work and raise a family.\" \"As the son of a World War II veteran and a Navy veteran myself, I know firsthand how important it is to support our veterans who have sacrificed so much for our country,\" Scott said. \"Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and my socialist opponent are trying to destroy the military with their woke nonsense and ruining the opportunity to live out the dream of this country. We won't let them. When I'm re-elected, I will continue to fight for Florida's active-duty military members, veterans, and their families.\"\"Florida GOP says Trump victory 'assured,' cites poll showing strong minority support\" via A.G. Gancarski of Florida Politics -- Democrats in Florida may be engaged statewide in grassroots campaigning for the otherwise absent Harris ticket. But Republicans have consistently said it's all for naught, and three weeks ahead of votes being counted, the Florida GOP is producing polling that shows Trump with majority support and a 7-point lead. \"Our polling shows what any sane observer already knows: Florida is not in play for Kamala Harris and the Democrats,\" said Republican Party of Florida (RPOF) Chair Evan Power. \"President Trump has a strong lead over Kamala Harris here, and this has been consistent in both public and private polling for months.\"\"Nonprofit launches new ads urging Floridians to vote 'no' on marijuana Amendment 3\" via Amber Jo Cooper of Florida's Voice -- Smart Approaches to Marijuana Action launched a new ad campaign urging Floridians to vote \"NO\" on Amendment 3, a Florida ballot initiative seeking to protect the recreational use of marijuana constitutionally. Smart Approaches to Marijuana Action is a nonprofit \"dedicated to a health-first approach to marijuana policy.\" In a news release, the group said the measure is being \"bankrolled\" by the state's largest marijuana corporation, Trulieve. The group said there has been an \"onslaught of pro-drug propaganda that implies marijuana and THC drugs are safe and even 'recreation.'\"\"Maxwell Frost, Debbie Mucarsel-Powell say Villages golf cart caravan translates into Dem momentum\" via A.G. Gancarski of Florida Politics -- Could an election victory in the Sunshine State be driven by senior citizens in vehicles that aren't exactly street legal? That's the case ebullient Democrats are making in the wake of a golf cart rally in The Villages, as the latest sign that a once reliably Republican sinecure is slipping from the GOP grasp and feeling, as Miles Davis might have put it, kind of blue. \"I appeal to everybody: democracy is not something we can agree to disagree on -- it's something we have to fight for,\" U.S. Rep. Frost said. \"This race is about more than just two names on a ballot, it's about a vision for this country and it's about true freedom. Vice President Kamala Harris and Democrats up and down the ballot are committed to delivering that freedom to each and every Floridian.\"\"DSCC teams up with Mucarsel-Powell on Scott 'snake' hit\" via A.G. Gancarski of Florida Politics -- In the stretch run of what some polls say is a very competitive race for Senate despite a strong GOP registration advantage, Democrat Mucarsel-Powell is getting some outside help in her messaging against first-term incumbent U.S. Sen. Scott. Mucarsel-Powell is joining with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) on a new TV spot. Per the Mucarsel-Powell campaign, the \"bold new TV ad\" scathes \"Florida's ultimate political snake.\" In proof of dedication to the serpentine imagery, the challenger's operation accuses the Naples Republican of \"slithering away\" from debate challenges in a news release pumping the paid media, which is part of an \"eight-figure buy.\"\"Florida Supervisors of Elections ask for more voting accommodations post-Milton\" via Jesse Scheckner of Florida Politics -- An organization representing election officials in all 67 Florida counties is again asking state officials for short-term accommodations so voters can cast ballots in storm-ravaged areas after Milton. The Florida Supervisors of Elections (FSE) sent a letter to Secretary of State Cord Byrd and Division of Elections Director Maria Matthews requesting temporarily loosened voting restrictions in 10 counties. They include Manatee, Pinellas, Polk and Sarasota counties, which the FSE letter noted as having suffered \"extensive damage\" from Milton; and Collier, Glades, Highlands, Indian River, Orange and St. Lucie counties in Central and East Florida, which sustained tornadic and water damage that could hinder regular election activity.\"Daryl Parks confesses to lies about Corey Simon's abortion record during debate\" via Brendon Leslie of Florida's Voice -- During a debate this week between Sen. Simon, a Tallahassee Republican, and Democratic opponent Parks, the challenger backtracked on previous lies against the Republican alleging he voted in favor of the six-week abortion ban. The backtracking comes after Parks had been spending millions of dollars in campaign ads that fearmongered voters by claiming that Simon voted in favor of the ban -- for which he did not. \"On the six-week abortion ban, what was my vote?\" Simon asked Parks during the debate. \"You voted against it,\" Parks responded. \"You voted against it.\" The law is more commonly known as the Heartbeat Protection Act, and Parks made a similarly false claim in September.Parks tops $1.75M in SD 3 -- Parks, the Democratic nominee for Senate District 3, announced his campaign has collected more than $1.75 million to date, including $365,000 through the first half of October. \"These fundraising numbers again demonstrate that Florida's working families are ready for change in Tallahassee. Change begins with firing Corey Simon and electing a State Senator with the courage and experience necessary to put solutions ahead of culture wars and stop Florida's decline into one of the most unaffordable states in the country,\" Parks said in a news release. \"No more corporate handouts while working families struggle with the rising costs of groceries, housing, health care, and defunded public schools, thanks to legislation passed by Corey Simon. North Florida deserves better, and I'm ready to be their champion.\" SD 3 spans 13 North Florida counties, including Leon, and was held by a Democrat before Simon's upset victory in the 2022 cycle.\"Carolina Amesty holds cash edge on Leonard Spencer, but is support drying up after her arrest?\" via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics -- Donations to Rep. Amesty's re-election effort have diminished since her arrest on forgery charges. But she still entered the last month of her re-election bid with more cash on hand than Democratic opponent Spencer. Amesty, as of Oct. 4, had raised more than $99,000 and still had $29,000 in her candidate account as the reporting period closed. Of course, most of Amesty's fundraising precedes her Aug. 29 arrest on four felony counts. Since then, she has raised about $2,400 collectively from seven donors. Meanwhile, the political committee Friends of Carolina Amesty has seen a net negative intake. While collecting a single $500 donation since the arrest, the political committee returned $13,000, including $12,500 to Orlando real estate developer Joseph Saunders.\"David Smith holds massive cash edge over Sarah Henry in closing weeks of HD 38 race\" via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics -- Heading into the last month of campaigning, Republican Rep. Smith holds a clear cash advantage over Henry. However, both state parties continue investing heavily in the House District 38 contest. Smith remains one of the most prolific fundraisers in the House, collecting more than $466,000 as he seeks a fourth term. After spending, he had over $121,000 in cash on hand as of Oct. 4 in his candidate account. By comparison, Henry, a Casselberry Democrat, has reported nearly $172,000 in donations. But she has also spent more than $176,000 through the last disclosure period, putting her under by more than $4,000. She spent nearly $39,000 in the last week of September with Snyder Pickerill Media Group in Chicago and almost $8,000 with Portland-based Mandate Media.\"Candidates for open House seat in Palm Beach County tied in fundraising -- but for very different reasons\" via Jesse Scheckner of Florida Politics -- Two candidates vying for the open House District 89 seat are now virtually tied in fundraising, but dialing down into their numbers reveals starkly different approaches to attracting campaign cash. Democrat Debra Tendrich, who bested a better-financed Primary foe to clinch her place on the Nov. 5 ballot, raised close to $67,000 between the time she filed to run in July 2023 and Oct. 4, 2024. That includes $23,000 amassed between Aug. 21, the day after the Primary, and Oct. 4, the last date campaign finance information is available on the Division of Elections website. Republican Daniel Zapata, meanwhile, raised $68,500 since filing in March 2023.\"DeSantis says 'red tape' being cut in disaster response, announces more funding\" via Amber Jo Cooper of Florida's Voice -- At a news conference Tuesday, DeSantis said the Florida Disaster Fund has drastically helped cut through \"red tape\" and awarded disaster relief funding to people who are in need. The Governor announced that $500,000 will be awarded to nonprofit organizations through the fund to provide free muck and gut services, debris removal, tarping, temporary home fixes, and other volunteer services. The Florida Disaster Fund is the state's private agency established to \"assist Florida's communities as they respond to and recover during times of emergency or disaster.\" DeSantis also announced $50,000 awards given to nonprofits such as Samaritan's Purse and Rebuilding Tampa Bay, among others. \"We appreciate what these groups can do.

Delivering immediate support to these agricultural producers is a critical first step to get them back on their feet in the wake of back-to-back disasters,\" said Simpson.\"Florida Bar responds to solicitation concerns post-hurricanes with Disciplinary Hotline\" via Mark D. Killian of The Florida Bar News -- In the aftermath of the widespread devastation caused by three major hurricanes making landfall in Florida this year, including Milton, The Florida Bar has activated its Disciplinary Hotline to address urgent concerns about potential professional misconduct and unlawful solicitation by lawyers taking advantage of vulnerable residents during these challenging times. Floridians who encounter such issues may report them to the Bar by calling the hotline at 833-979-8225. Bar rules strictly prohibit lawyers from soliciting clients in person, by phone, via cold call, or through third parties unless the client is a family member or someone with whom the lawyer has a prior professional relationship.\"Small business disaster loan program is out of money until Congress approves new funds\" via Mae Anderson of The Associated Press -- The Small Business Administration has run out of money for the disaster assistance loans it offers small businesses, homeowners and renters, delaying much-needed relief for people applying for aid in the wake of the destruction caused by Helene and Milton. The SBA offers Economic Injury Disaster Loans to businesses and people affected by disasters. The SBA warned earlier this month that it could run out of funding, given the anticipated surge in Helene claims, without additional Congress funding. Other disaster relief programs are available, including assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. The FEMA aid isn't affected by the SBA shortfall. Helene was a Category 4 storm that first struck Florida's Gulf Coast on Sept. 26, dumped trillions of gallons of rain, and left a trail of destruction for hundreds of miles across several states. Milton swept across Florida two weeks later.\"Democrats in Congress seek to prevent another Jan. 6 riot, protect Electoral College certification\" via Scott MacFarlane of CBS News -- In a nondescript office a few floors above the cafeteria and a Dunkin' in the Longworth U.S. House Office Building, Democratic staffers on a low-profile U.S. House Committee have been gaming out what they say are some political nightmare scenarios. They're discussing the perils of Jan. 6. But not Jan. 6, 2021. Democrats on the House Committee on Administration, which oversees the U.S. Capitol campus and federal election laws, have been meeting and designing a plan against any attempt to interfere with the Electoral College certification on Jan. 6, 2025.\"FDLE reports seven deaths in St. Lucie County related to Milton\" via Treasure Coast Newspapers -- The Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) is reporting seven fatalities in the county related to Milton. Although FDLE did not provide any other information, it noted that \"the determination whether a death is storm-related is made by local agencies. Therefore, there can be discrepancies over which deaths are storm related. FDLE does not make that determination.\" St. Lucie County Sheriff Keith Pearson released the names of six people who lived in Spanish Lakes Country Club Village in Lakewood Park who died when a tornado rolled through the community on Oct. 9 before the hurricane.\"Indian River schools plan makeup days for Helene, Milton; Martin still deciding\" via Colleen Wixon of Treasure Coast Newspapers -- Treasure Coast School Districts are working with the Florida Department of Education to see whether they will have to make up days lost from hurricanes Helene and Milton. One School District has already made plans to make up that time. State law mandates School Districts provide a 180-day school year, or the equivalent of 720 school hours per semester for kindergarten to third grade students, and 900 hours for grades 4-12. School cancellations are required to be made up in the same semester. However, the state Education Commissioner has the authority to waive makeup days. Students in Indian River and Martin counties returned to school Monday after almost a week off because of Milton.\"Hope after hurricane: Wellington football program comes to aid of neighbor in need\" via Alexander Peterman of The Palm Beach Post -- After their football game was canceled last Friday, the members of Wellington's football program made sure to make a difference off the field rather than on it. In the wake of Milton, head coach Ross Pryor checked in to ensure all his players and families were safe from the tornado activity that ripped through the city. They were safe and unharmed, but it didn't mean their communities had all escaped with the same fortune. One player's friend had a neighbor in dire need of help after a tree punctured her roof, causing wreckage inside and outside her home.\"Miami City Commissioners approve lifetime pensions for themselves: 'It's a 24-hour job'\" via Tess Riski of the Miami Herald -- Miami's part-time elected officials agreed to give themselves lifetime pensions in a final vote on Tuesday, reviving a program that was frozen in 2009 during the financial crisis. The City Commission had considered sending the question to voters in a referendum but ultimately decided against that. Commissioners Miguel Angel Gabela and Christine King -- co-sponsors of the resolution -- voted in favor of the pensions, along with Commissioner Joe Carollo. Commissioners Manolo Reyes and Damian Pardo voted against them. Pardo's preference was to send the question to voters. \"Otherwise for me, I see it as self-dealing,\" Pardo said. However, because his colleagues approved it in spite of that preference, Pardo said he plans to opt in to the program. \"I work as hard as everybody else,\" Pardo said.\"Jupiter's Deputy Police Chief Michael Barbera to become town's new Police Chief\" via Maya Washburn of the Palm Beach Post -- Deputy Chief Barbera will become Jupiter's new Police Chief starting Wednesday, Oct. 30.

Here's the breakdown.\" via Sarah Kinbar of the Tampa Bay Business Journal -- Milton marked another time Orlando's largest theme park -- Walt Disney World -- has had to shutter, easily costing the entertainment giant millions of dollars in lost revenue. Closures at Disney due to storms date back to 1999, and the losses aren't small, according to International Theme Park Services, a Cincinnati-based consulting company fronted by CEO Dennis Speigel that has tracked Walt Disney World's storm-related losses for the past 25 years. For example, Walt Disney World in 1999 witnessed its first hurricane-related closure when Hurricane Floyd caused it to shutter Sept. 14 that year and reopen two days later. While Floyd caused $6.5 billion in damage, Florida was largely spared, as the storm veered in a different direction than originally thought. However, Speigel said Disney incurred losses of about $45 million per day due to being closed.\"What's the status of Playalinda Beach? Still closed because of Milton damage?\" via Michelle Spitzer of Florida Today -- It took about a year to restore damaged dunes Playalinda Beach suffered in late 2022 from Ian and Nicole. Those same dunes are once again demolished by Milton, closing the popular north Brevard beach that attracts millions a year. Milton hit Brevard County as a Category 1 storm last week, with its eye passing over the northern part of the Space Coast. The dunes are a fraction of the damage Playalinda Beach experienced. \"The damage is pretty similar to what happened after Nicole,\" said Laura Henning, representative for Canaveral National Seashore, which Playalinda is a part of. \"Boardwalks were damaged; there's about 2- to 3-feet of sand on the road. There's flooding and sand in the bathrooms.\"\"Buddy Dyer calls for big changes to downtown Orlando\" via Gabrielle Russon of Florida Politics -- Downtown Orlando is undergoing a transformation as the city targets streets and lakes that need a pedestrian-friendly makeover, Mayor Dyer said during his annual State of the Downtown Address. Dyer spoke at the Kia Center, where the Orlando Magic play, as he discussed his plans to change downtown. Dyer called for investments in upgrading Lake Eola's bathrooms and walking paths and then highlighted several less popular areas that needed to be reinvented. He did not give a cost estimate. \"It's long past time that we remake our streets, sidewalks, bike lanes, streetscapes, public transportation and other assets to better serve those who live in our community today. It's time we build a modern transit network that gives residents and businesses more opportunities to succeed,\" Dyer said.\"Orange Supervisor of Elections candidates face off again -- and this time it counts\" via Ryan Gillespie of the Orlando Sentinel -- The four Democratic candidates for Orange County Supervisor of Elections were gearing up for an August vote -- but on Friday before Election Day, a judge kicked a no-party candidate off the ballot and moved the race to November. Now, the contenders are competing with each other and for attention on a crowded four-page ballot they had expected to avoid. \"The attention seems to have moved to other races,\" said Karen Castor Dentel, a School Board member vying for the post. \"Whether that is the State Attorney's race, the presidential race ... as a Supervisor of Elections candidate, it's hard to compete with that.\" Fellow Dems Wes Hodge, Dan Helm and Sunshine Linda-Marie Grund agreed.\"Osceola County hopes voters embrace land conservation tax\" via Natalia Jaramillo of the Orlando Sentinel -- After 20 years of paying a special property tax for land conservation, Osceola County voters will decide in November whether they want to keep doing it. The tax-funded program has conserved 3,300 acres, county officials say, including important lands such as Shingle Creek Regional Park; Brownie Wise Park, where the county plans to build the region's first Pulse memorial; and Lake Runnymede Conservation area, which plays a critical water management role because its wetlands absorb excess rainfall. Supporters say the program helps manage growth, control congestion, and reduce flooding, which are shared concerns for county residents. But opponents say they have lost trust in the county's land conservation efforts.\"Alfy Agarie, Chandler Langevin square off in a runoff for Palm Bay City Council Seat 3\" via Jim Waymer of Florida Today -- This race pits a trucking business owner against a veteran coordinator to see who can better manage Palm Bay's growth.

Where the Rays play, how long they are displaced and what repairs beyond a new custom roof are needed to return to Tropicana Field -- until the planned 2028 opening of their new stadium. The Rays have to get a sense of whether they are looking for a temporary home for a few months, for an entire season, or all three years. Major League Baseball will have a say, and the players union will surely be involved. There will be a lengthy list of options, maybe 50 locations long, with some more suitable based on the length of stay. And all come with concerns such as weather, location, facilities and/or scheduling conflicts based on the primary tenant.\"NFL owners put stadium deal between Jacksonville Jaguars and city over goal line\" via David Bauerlein of The Florida Times-Union -- National Football League owners put their unanimous stamp of approval Tuesday on the $1.4 billion stadium deal that will keep Jacksonville as an NFL city for another 30 years. The sign-off by the owners during their Fall meeting in Atlanta was the final step for the agreement that will obligate city taxpayers to finance $775 million for a canopy-covered, completely overhauled stadium. Jaguars owner Shad Khan will foot the bill for another $625 million and take on responsibility for any cost overruns. If City Council approval of the agreement on June 25 was a \"touchdown,\" as then-Council President Ron Salem declared that night, the approval by NFL owners added the point after the touchdown needed for the winning margin.\"Faith-based summit set for Florida's Panhandle on Thursday\" via Drew Dixon of Florida Politics -- Faith leaders will convene on Thursday for an event to examine faith-related issues and their relationship with the health care system.

You may experience a range of intense emotions, such as anxiety, depression, feelings of shock or dissociation from reality.Weather-related incidents can trigger a natural response called post-traumatic stress. It's the mind's way of protecting you. When those feelings last longer than a month or begin interfering with everyday life, they become a mental health concern.Prolonged mental health impacts that are left untreated can develop into a more serious condition called post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).People who are already struggling with poverty, homelessness, or other socioeconomic issues may be at higher risk for severe symptoms of PTSD after a hurricane. These issues can make it more difficult for individuals to prepare for and respond to a storm.Professional approaches, including talk therapy, can benefit individuals after a hurricane. Whether a person works 1:1 with a therapist or in a group, both options provide a safe and supportive environment for sharing experiences and learning healthy coping strategies.Post-traumatic stress after a hurricane is a normal reaction to witnessing a traumatic situation. Symptoms can become debilitating, but they can also be effectively managed with professional help and coping strategies.You are not alone in your experience. Help is available.-- OPINIONS --\"The eerie chill of the Monday after Milton\" via Stephanie Hayes of the Tampa Bay Times -- Monday has never made much sense, with its promise of newness steeped in the dread of alarms, commutes and punishing routine. The Monday after back-to-back hurricanes made even less sense to the senses. The weather was chaotically perfect, the most \"ahhh\" Tampa Bay has \"ahhh-ed\" since Spring. The cool, dry air felt like a perverse joke after so many people spent hours last week huddling inside closets with the walls and windows shaking. The world outside was jostled, crooked and catawampus like a Tim Burton film.\"Winter Park proves underground power lines are the way to go\" via Scott Maxwell of the Orlando Sentinel -- Last Thursday, when the tailwinds of Milton were still having their way with Central Florida, hundreds of thousands of residents woke up to homes without power. In Seminole County, one of every four Florida Power & Light customers were left in the dark. The same was true for customers of the Orlando Utilities Commission, as more than 50,000 OUC customers couldn't make a pot of coffee, turn on their A/C, or fire up the TV to \n\"Doug Wheeler: Time to trim the tax burden for Florida salons, barbershops\" via Florida Politics -- An incredible 64% of Florida companies have less than five employees, many of whom rely on customer tips to support their families. This is especially true for hair stylists, barbers, and nail technicians. Over 30 years ago, Congress provided a reimbursement tax credit to restaurants and bars, which effectively cancels out the taxes they must pay on their employees' tips. On good days, this tax relief has enabled many of our local food service establishments to grow and thrive. On bad days, such as during the thick of the COVID-19 pandemic, it represents the only thing keeping many of them solvent. This has been an example of good public policy. That is why small business-friendly members of Congress are asking a fair question: what about barbers, salons, and spas? These businesses bear the same financial burdens as restaurants and rely on tips just as much as food establishments. Don't they deserve the same tax benefits that Florida's restaurants and bars currently have?\"Universal plans early Summer launch of new park with marquee Harry Potter ride\" via Robbie Whelan and Jacob Passy of The Wall Street Journal -- Universal is readying its attack on Disney's theme park stronghold in Florida. The company is planning for its 750-acre Universal Epic Universe park to be fully opened as early as Memorial Day weekend of next year -- earlier than expected -- with tickets on sale as soon as this month, according to people familiar with the matter. If successful, Universal's new park could be a significant broadside in the theme park wars, which have intensified in recent years as live entertainment has become more central to generating growth at big media companies like Comcast -- Universal's parent company -- and Disney. Universal said it hasn't yet confirmed an opening date. The timing of the planned opening could change.\"Princess Cruises brings biggest ship Sun Princess to Florida\" via Richard Tribou of the Orlando Sentinel -- The fanfare was dialed back because of Milton. Still, Princess Cruises began sailing its newest ship, Sun Princess, out of Port Everglades over the weekend. The biggest ship in the Princess fleet debuted out of Europe earlier this year but has begun its Winter Caribbean sailing season from the line's primary Florida home port in Fort Lauderdale. The 177,882-gross-ton ship has a 4,314-passenger capacity based on double occupancy. It's the first of the line's new Sphere class of vessels, the first to run on liquefied natural gas, part of parent company Carnival Corp.'s efforts to reduce emissions.\"Stone crab season is here, with some reminders from state officials\" via Drew Dixon of Florida Politics -- Stone crab is one of Florida's authentic dining treats, and the recreation and commercial season for catching the crustaceans is on Tuesday. Stone crab season runs through May 1 in Florida waters and associated waters. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) encourages residents who are 16 years or older to take advantage of the season. But there are some strict reminders and stipulations before throwing down stone crab traps into state and federal waters. For recreational stone crabbers, crab trap registrations are required. The application process is free at the FWC registration website. There's also license registration at that site. Following that registration, each person gets a unique trap registration number attached to each trap in a legible and permanent label. Those requirements apply to local waters as well as federal waters.",

    "content": "Former president Donald Trump has built up more momentum on his road to an election victory as the latest polling suggests he has taken a game changing lead in a majority of swing states.The latest Real Clear Polling (RCP) figures, which aggregates the top polls, has found Trump leading in six of the seven swing states which could decide the 2024 Presidential Election.When the results are inputted into the electoral map, Trump holds a strong position towards winning another presidency, however, some states reflect a razor thin margin which shows it is either candidate's race.The swing states Trump leads in include Georgia by 0.7 points, Nevada by 0.5 points, Michigan by one point and Arizona by 1.1 points.Trump also leads in Pennsylvania and North Carolina by 0.3 and 1.4 points.Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris leads by a 0.3-point margin in Wisconsin.To be victorious in the upcoming election on November 5, either candidate must secure at least 270 electoral college votes from the presidential electors across all states.Each state has a varying number of electoral votes based on the number of members the state has in Congress. A total of 538 presidential electors, who form the electoral votes, make up the Electoral College.For example, California, which has the most electors of any state, has a total of 54 electoral college votes based on its 52 members of the House of Representatives and two senators.However, according to polling site FiveThirtyEight (538), powered by ABC News US, which includes and rejects different pollsters to RCP - such as Rasmussen Reports, a different story has been told.In 538's current polling averages, Harris leads in Pennsylvania by 0.7 points, Michigan by 0.7 points, Nevada by 0.7 points and Wisconsin by 0.5 points.Meanwhile, Trump leads in North Carolina by 0.9 points, Arizona by 1.6 points and Georgia by one point.In contrast to RCP's model, if 538's polling averages are reflected on November 5, Ms Harris would win the Presidency securing 276 electoral college votes.According to Polymarket, which predicts outcomes of events based on users' bets, Trump sits at a 58.3 per cent chance of becoming the next US president, while Harris trails at 41.5 per cent.Polymarket also predicted a marginal favourability for Trump in Nevada by one point, Wisconsin by six points, with the Republican up in Michigan and Pennsylvania by eight pointsHowever, North Carolina, Georgie and Arizona were tipped to vote overwhelmingly in Trump's favour with a huge lead of 26, 27 and 36 points respectively.In 2016, Trump won in all swing states bar Nevada.In 2020, Trump ceded Georgia, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, winning only North Carolina.This week, Trump with travel to Michigan and Pennsylvania to hold rallies in Detroit and Latrobe, before he turns his eyes to Georgia and New York next week.Harris also continues to campaign in the vital swing states and will pivot from Pennsylvania and Michigan to Wisconsin this week.",

The writer of this pile of garbage, Gabe Sherman, a lowlife and talentless hack, who has long been widely discredited, knew that, but chose to ignore it.\"The director had something to say in return. Ali Abbasi claimed he had also received legal letters from Trump's team.By a landslide, \"The Apprentice\" is the most controversial movie of the fall. It stars Stan as a young Trump playing apprentice to the attorney Roy Cohn ( Jeremy Strong ) while trying to make a name for himself in 1980s New York real estate. Already, \"The Apprentice\" has had one of the most tortured paths to movie theaters of any 2024 release.After its debut at the Cannes Film Festival, all the major studios and top specialty labels passed on making an offer. One potential issue was a cease and desist letter from Trump's legal team. Another was that one of the movie's investors -- Dan Snyder, the former owner of the Washington Commanders and a Trump supporter -- wanted to exit the movie.Only last week, Briarcliff Entertainment announced that it will open \"The Apprentice\" on Oct. 11, just weeks before Election Day. And it's still fighting for more screens. On Tuesday, the filmmakers took the unusual step of launching a Kickstarter crowdsourcing campaign to raise money for its release.\"This project has been pretty crazy, from beginning to the end,\" Abbasi says. \"It's still not completely there. It's going to get more crazy, maybe.\"Trump's reelection campaign has vigorously opposed the movie. After its Cannes debut, Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung called the film \"pure fiction.\" On Friday, after its release date was confirmed, Cheung declared it \"election interference by Hollywood elites.\"What role, if any, \"The Apprentice\" might play in the lead-up to Nov. 5 will be one of the most notable storylines at the movies this fall. While many Hollywood stars are vocal supporters of Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, it's far rarer that plainly political films squeak through today's sequel- and superhero-dominated movie industry. That makes for a unique election-year test case: Will liberals want to see a film about Trump? Will conservatives turn out for a film Trump opposes?",

    "content": "Former Deputy Secretary of State Wendy R. Sherman said the humanitarian \"situation in Gaza is absolutely dire\" during a talk at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum on Tuesday.Sherman's comments came during an event hosted by the IOP about the national security and foreign policy challenges that the next U.S. president will face after they take office in January. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are in the final weeks of a campaign to succeed President Joe Biden, who dropped out of the race in July.The war in Israel and Gaza has emerged as one of the most prominent foreign policy issues during the 2024 presidential election, with many Democratic voters sharply divided over the conflict.The death toll in Gaza has surpassed 42,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. The vast majority of the dead are women and children, according to the ministry.Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs Director Meghan L. O'Sullivan moderated the event with Sherman, which touched on a number of major U.S. foreign policy issues, including the war in Ukraine, the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine, U.S.-China relations, and the Biden administration's withdrawal from Afghanistan.Even as Sherman highlighted the humanitarian devastation caused by Israel's yearlong war in Gaza, she said that Israel had a right under international law to protect itself from future terrorist attacks.\"I firmly believe that Israel has a right to defend itself,\" Sherman said.She also emphasized that the United States and Israel are not the only countries responsible for fostering a democracy in Palestine.\"We don't always talk about the rest of the region or the rest of the world and their role in helping the Palestinians ensure that they have a political horizon and a way to have a state for their own peace and dignity,\" she said.\"That's partly our job, that's Israel's job, but it's also the job of all the other regional players,\" Sherman added.During the event, Sherman also discussed the dangers of American isolationism.\"In order to preserve our country and take care of American citizens, we have to engage with the world,\" Sherman said. \"To keep the world peaceful, to get stability, to have a robust economy, we have to engage with others.\"In response to a question about the war in Ukraine from O'Sullivan, Sherman said that she expects the conflict to continue stalemating.\"I don't think Putin is anywhere close to wanting to negotiate unless he can negotiate on his own terms -- and that is to have Ukraine,\" Sherman said.Bahar Moradi '27, a member of the IOP's JFK Jr. Forum Committee, said in an interview after the event that it's important to have conversations that reach out to a broad range of people, \"especially with the election around the corner.\"Some other attendees, however, said that they wished Sherman spoke more about Trump and Harris' foreign policy positions.\"I wanted to hear more about the next president, what her projections were,\" said Mohammad-Reza Jamali, a graduate student at Tufts University's Fletcher School who is enrolled in courses at the Harvard Kennedy School.Sherman said in an interview with The Crimson after the event that she believed the American electorate needed to remain invested in Washington remaining a major player on the world stage.\"I think it is really critical for everyone in America to understand that although we must invest in our own country, our future is connected to the rest of the world,\" Sherman said.",

    "title": "US elections 'going down to the wire': Will social media prove decisive?",
    "content": "Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are throwing political punches at each other as they stump in key battleground states less than a month before the 2024 US presidential election on Nov. 5.October has already been a busy month for the United States with two major hurricanes -- Helene and Milton -- pummeling a large swath of the southeastern US. With those disasters have come Republican-based conspiracy theories that President Joe Biden, Harris, and the Democrats are somehow withholding disaster aid from Republican areas. Trump, himself, made such claims without evidence after Helene battered Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, and Tennessee two weeks ago.\"It's one of those situations where most people do sort of take the word of elected officials and in this case, Trump, he was the president, and so, he has a great deal of sway over many Republicans, and so they're more inclined to buy into those conspiracy theories,\" said Jennifer Clark, an associate professor of political science at the University of Houston.Clark told Anadolu that partisan conspiracy theorists and misinformation campaigns on social media could help sway voters to either Trump, the Republican nominee, or Harris, the Democratic nominee, especially by pushing untruths to their respective political bases.\"The problem with social media is that once the information is out there, if somebody tweets something out, then it spreads like rapid fire. And even if you then can put on a notification or delete the post or correct the record, it's already out there, and most people don't actually then go and find out the real information, or they don't revisit it and see if there's a community note that kind of corrects the misinformation,\" she said.Clark referred to the August presidential debate between Trump and Harris in which Trump perpetuated false Republican claims that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio were \"eating dogs ... they're eating cats, they're eating pets of the people who live there.\"\"It's already out there, and more and more people are spreading it, and it goes viral, and that's what makes it, I think, very challenging in the social media age, is because things can spread so quickly, and people will just share the information, and not even, like, fact check it before they share it, and so then the perception is out there, and perception can be reality in politics,\" she said.On the flip side of social media, Clark points out that posts from celebrities can also impact the election, highlighting what has been dubbed the \"Taylor Swift effect.\" The pop music superstar endorsed Harris after the vice presidential debate last month between Republican candidate JD Vance and Democratic opponent Tim Walz.\"I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election,\" Swift posted on Instagram. \"I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.\"Clark told Anadolu there is a reason the presidential candidates have a major presence on social media and why they are heavily invested in platforms like Facebook, X, Instagram, and TikTok. It is not only a way for them to get their message out to the public en masse, but it also allows celebrities like Swift, who has 283 million followers on Instagram alone, to motivate their fans to take part in the political process.\"Certainly, with someone like Taylor Swift, she actually could mobilize the youth in particular,\" said Clark. \"And that's the key because we know that oftentimes younger voters, they don't register, they don't turn out at the rates that maybe we would expect them to, and in certain key swing states, if she can get them to register and to actually turn out, then they really could make a big difference in that election.\"\"Things can just go viral very quickly, and so it matters a great deal,\" she continued. \"It really can affect how people engage in politics and, ultimately, who they support.\"Key issues and swing statesClark explained that beyond the high-profile superstar entertainers and polarizing conspiracy theories, there are some key issues that voters want to see both candidates address: the economy, abortion, gun control, immigration, and American involvement in international conflicts, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in Gaza.Clark pointed out that the latter issue is a given for Trump and the Republicans because they side with Israel as a US ally, but for Harris and the Democrats, it is a slightly more gray area with the vice president sitting on both sides of the fence.\"For Kamala Harris, I think, it's like threading that needle, essentially,\" said the professor. \"She's reluctant to go full-out critical of (Israeli Prime Minister) Benjamin Netanyahu, but on the other hand, she recognizes that there are differing opinions, and has been critical of some of the actions that Israel has taken.\"And so, I think she's just going to sort of have to play that very carefully, essentially assuaging both sides within her party, because she still has to appeal to the sympathetic side of 42,000, mostly children and women, Palestinians being killed.\"This last big push to the finish line is crucial for both candidates, Clark added, underlining that the election is \"going down to the wire\" once every vote is cast and counted on Nov. 5.Clark pointed out that the key swing states that will likely determine the election are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, emphasizing that Trump and Harris need to concentrate on the issues and how they relate to their respective voter bases in those battleground states.It is not surprising, then, that the most recent polls in those swing states have Trump and Harris in a virtual tie.Even though Harris leads with 48.5% to Trump's 46% in the overall average of the major presidential polls taken across the United States, when it comes to those key swing states, both candidates are within just a percentage point of each other in the polls, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3%, the professor told Anadolu that the presidential race is literally a toss-up.\"It's almost like a coin flip,\" said Clark. \"They're the swing voters, the ones that both candidates are really trying to appeal to right now, and that could come down to just days before the election, even who they ultimately support.\"October is going to be a crucial month for both Trump and Harris, with their ultimate goal to convince voters to tip the balance in the 2024 US presidential election in each of their favor. The professor said that both candidates need to execute their campaign game plan wisely to convince undecided voters to choose them.\"It's going to come down to a handful of states, and just who has the better ground game in terms of just registering their voters and turning them out,\" said Clark. \"Essentially, there's still a great deal of time left before the election.\"",

    "title": "Election polls are flawed. They're also the best tool we have.",
    "content": "Traverse Burnett is a research director at Digital Research, Inc., a Portland firm that conducts surveys for private-sector clients as well as regular political polls. The Bangor Daily News has previously paid the company for both types of surveys.Election years can be very good for those of us in the polling business. We're typically asked to do more surveys and focus groups, and those projects get more attention than almost any of our other work.Most of us in the consumer insights field make our living providing businesses and other private clients with information about public and consumer opinion -- helping them make decisions that can improve their bottom line or solve a particular challenge.I'd like to think we're good at that. Our clients can measure our accuracy based on outside measures of sales, market share, and customer satisfaction, and the better we are at finding the trends and gauging underlying currents in consumer sentiment, the better our business is.But predicting an election is an entirely different matter.This is especially true for the toss-up 2024 presidential election between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Many talented groups are trying to predict the outcome of the election and are only able to reaffirm the race is \"close\" and \"within the margin of error.\" Frustrating as it is for the pollster and the public, it's likely the truth.Even in the best of times, pollsters have to make a number of judgment calls in the methodology, sample design, and conclusions that shape our predictions of key races. Slight shifts in any of these components of a survey have an outsized impact on our overall predictions.Survey researchers are haunted by the failure of 2016, when disengaged voters weren't well represented in polls yet proved decisive for Trump at the ballot box. The predictions since then have generally come much closer to the actual outcome, but the fact that most polls of national and swing-state voters are incredibly close suggests differences in methodology aren't dramatically impacting the predictions this time around.It's probably also worth noting that Maine presents a special case on its own. For one, we're highly engaged, with some of the highest rates of voter registration and participation in the nation. Since the voters we survey in the state are highly likely to actually vote, predicting the outcome of an election can be easier here than in other states.At the same time, Maine allows ranked-choice voting for national elections, which can drastically change how accurate a poll may be. Even a well-run poll may put one candidate across the threshold needed to avoid a ranked-choice count, meaning we wouldn't incorporate a runoff in our prediction. But things can change dramatically if voter turnout comes in slightly differently than we estimated or if just a few voters unexpectedly move towards one of the candidates.That sort of small shift may not matter much in determining the outcome of a standard election, but a runoff can change the outcome of a race in ways no poll can predict. That's what happened in 2020, when most polls pointed to Democrat Sara Gideon winning against incumbent U.S. Sen. Susan Collins in a ranked-choice runoff.In the end, Collins was able to meld her Republican base with unexpected swing voter support to win an outright majority and avoid a runoff. Even if estimates of voter preference weren't drastically different from reality in that race, predictions of the results definitely were.There's also a technical difficulty involved in asking voters to rank multiple candidates sequentially for a poll in a ranked-choice election. It's not so much of a challenge with an online survey, but it does have the potential to constrain or impact the accuracy of a telephone poll - no longer the gold standard it once was in polling methodology.Elections are complicated, and we will never be able to see everything before a race is over. And while polling is flawed, it remains the best way to objectively understand and estimate where things stand in the political and business world. Even if the election predictions aren't spot-on in Maine, swing states, or the country as a whole, they still tell us something.What we know they're telling us now is that America is evenly divided between two dramatically different paths, although you probably knew that already.",

We have been forced by that rapidly increasing daily influx to focus all our attention only on whatever dumpster fire situation is brought to our attention in any given hour of the day.The result is that we have dangerously normalized in our own minds, and come to accept, that no one is going to call \"the powerful\" out for their completely unacceptable behavior and injustice. Except, Mark Halperin is. Let it be a reminder to the rest of us to not forget the most basic injury being perpetrated by those in power and their collusion with the media -- the simple negligence to inform Americans that it is happening!That negligence is part of the reason behind what Halperin is predicting in the case of a Trump victory in the 2024 Presidential election. People have so normalized the blatant neglect of the press to call a spade a spade, that when someone like President Trump comes along DOING EXACTLY THAT -- they simply buy in to the narrative that he's...When the reality is he is literally the polar opposite of all those things. He STANDS UP to bullies; but that doesn't make him a bully. He TEARS DOWN tyrants; but that doesn't make him a tyrant. And the only time he seems hateful or divisive is when he's dealing with a bully, a tyrant, or when someone gets DEFENSIVE about his attacks on bullies and tyrants. (Which, if you take all the Trump-haters... I suspect that is where they have gone wrong. And that's on them.)Speaking of bullies and tyrants, here is what Halperin had to say about Kamala Harris and the insulting nature of her refusal to reveal \"what she really stands for\".In line with Halperin's take, Fox News just ran a story trying to get at the heart of Kamala's economic policies. Lots of soundbites, but not a lot of tangible explanations. Even so, her actions are on record -- and in most of those instances, what she says and what she actually does are two very different things.Harris' campaign website claims she was a strong advocate for small businesses as both a U.S. senator and later as vice president. She was California's junior senator from 2017-2021, when Trump occupied the White House, during which time she opposed the GOP economic agenda.Harris voted against the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which slashed corporate taxes and provided tax relief for small businesses with the Qualified Business Income Deduction, in addition to changes in individual tax deductions and the family tax credit, which affects the economy overall.As one of the more liberal members of the Senate, Harris co-sponsored the Raise the Wage Act of 2019. Introduced by self-described democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the bill would have increased the federal minimum wage to $15. Republicans opposed the effort, arguing it would increase costs on businesses that rely on low-skill or entry-level labor. It passed the House but died in the Senate.Halperin also talked about the very telling lack of engagement Kamala has with black men in particular (strange, considering she claims to be black... I wonder if black men simply see through the political gaming effort?).Highlighted by Obama's recent attempt to SHAME BLACK MEN into supporting Kamala, Halperin talked about the consistent pushback he hears from the black men that Kamala so desperately pretends to have eating out of the palm of her hand.All in all, I am not surprised to hear someone with Mark Halperin's political sourcing confirm what we all suspected about the coup that was conducted right under the noses of an apathetic America. And it tells me this: we can not move forward carrying that much apathy and expect anything to change.We have seen far too many dots that perfectly connect, telling us emphatically just what the end goals are for the powerful and the power-hungry who sit in the halls of power in the United States as we speak... to simply sit back on our apathetic rear-ends and let it happen.I've said this before. \"Make America Great Again\" is a powerless slogan, if all it does is fancy up a red hat. We are going to have to become a people of ACTION, once again. President Trump, amazing though he is, can not confront these evils and fix the problems alone. It will take all of us, at the least... a lot of us, stepping up, counting the cost, and holding people to account.THAT is what it will take to turn America back into the sort of nation where a COUP is an unheard of impossibility, rather than a run-of-the-mill data point in a never ending stream of overwhelming data.They have normalized TYRANNY. And it is time we normalize the antidote to tyranny, and \"become ungovernable\" again -- strangely enough, the epitome of a FREE AND SECURE STATE. A free and secure America? That should not sound as improbable as it does. I believe we have a chance to regain that reality -- if we deal with our own apathy. And then we can deal with the tyrants.",

    "content": "Demoratic Presidential nominee Kamala Harris participates in a 'town hall' with radio host Charlamagne tha God, in Detroit, Michigan, on Tuesday. Source: REUTERS.Democratic nominee for the 2024 US Presidential election, Kamala Harris, called her competitor and Republican candidate Donald Trump \"full of mis- and disinformation\" and denied his claims that she does not have the interests of black Americans.During an hour-long radio town hall, Harris also warned that Trump would try to \"institutionalise\" harsh policing tactics that disproportionately affect Black men across America as she promised to push for legislation to address discriminatory law enforcement practices.Harris went on to say that she would work to decriminalise marijuana, which accounts for arrests that also disproportionately impact Black men. She even acknowledged that racial disparities and bias exist in everyday life for Black people -- in home ownership, health care, economic prosperity and even voting.While Harris is working on energising Black men in battleground Michigan, Trump focused on women as he faced an all-female audience during a Fox News town hall in swing-state Georgia.Trump evaded questions about the erosion of abortion rights under his watch and instead talked much about America's culture wars by vowing to ban male-born athletes from competing in women's sports.The November 5 US election 2024 is merely 21 days away and Harris and Trump are trying to woo voters in key constituencies.If elected, Harris would be the US' first woman president. She hopes to expand her party's advantage among female voters. Trump, on the other hand, is showing modest signs of progress among Black men, who have overwhelmingly backed Democrats in the past.A slightest shift among any group could swing the election.During the radio town hall, Harris emphasised that despite the persistence of racial bias, no one has a pass to sit out the election.\"We should never sit back and say, 'OK, I'm not going to vote because everything hasn't been solved,'\" she said.\"This is a margin-of-error race. It's tight. I'm going to win. I'm going to win, but it's tight,\" she further said.The vice president, who took questions from listeners who called in and also from a series of people who joined in-studio, was asked about reparations, or potential government payments to the descendants of enslaved people.To this, she responded that the notion \"has to be studied, there's no question about that.\"It's a position she's taken before, but which Trump's campaign immediately pounced on, saying the vice president was \"open\" to payments that could cost billions.Trump, meanwhile, has called for a return to \"proven crime fighting methods, including stop and frisk and broken windows policing.\"The tactic, deployed by the New York City Police Department, involved stopping, questioning and sometimes frisking people deemed \"reasonably suspicious.\" It disproportionately affected Black and Hispanic men, and in 2013 the policy was found to have violated the US Constitution.Harris said part of her challenge is that Trump's campaign is \"trying to scare people away because otherwise they know they have nothing to run on. Ask Donald Trump what is his plan for Black America. Ask him.\"Trump did not respond to Harris' criticism during multiple stops Tuesday, including a nighttime rally in Atlanta, where he railed against Democrats, the media and immigrants in the country illegally.Trump also pledged to ban \"men in women's sports,\" a reference to transgender women allowed to compete against women in some cases.Asked how he would enforce a ban, Trump said: \"You just ban it. President bans. You just don't let it happen.\"This week Harris is expected to announce a series of new proposals dubbed the \"Opportunity Agenda for Black Men,\" meant to offer Black men more economic advantages -- including providing forgivable business loans of up to $20,000 for entrepreneurs and creating more apprenticeships. The plans would also support the study of sickle cell and other diseases more common in Black men.The focus on Black men sharpened last week when former President Barack Obama campaigned for Harris in Pittsburgh and said he wanted to speak \"some truths\" to Black male voters, suggesting some \" just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president.\"The vice president's campaign says it doesn't believe Black men will flip in large numbers to supporting Trump, especially after strongly backing Democrat Joe Biden, with Harris as his running mate, in 2020. They are more concerned about a measurable percentage of Black males opting not to vote at all.",

    "content": "More than 300,000 voters cast ballots on the first day of early voting in Georgia, a key battleground state in the 2024 US presidential election.The US state of Georgia reported a record turnout on the first day of early voting for the US presidential election on Tuesday.Georgia is a key battleground state in the race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.More than 300,000 people cast their ballots, according to election officials, over double the 136,000 who participated in the first day of early voting in the 2020 election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Gabriel Sterling, the chief operating officer for the Office of the Georgia Secretary of State, praised the \"spectacular\" turnout on X.Both Harris's and Trump's campaigns have set their sights on winning Georgia. Trump held a rally on Tuesday in the state's capital, Atlanta, and Harris will also hold an event in the city on Saturday.In 2020, President Joe Biden became the first Democrat to win the state since 1992, a victory largely attributed to an uptick in Black voting. Black residents make up about one-third of Georgia's population.Questions about the validity of Georgia's election proceedings continue to hang over the state's vote.A judge blocked a new rule on Tuesday that requires Georgia Election Day ballots to be counted by hand after the close of voting. The ruling came a day after the same judge ruled that county election officials must certify election results by the deadline set in law.The State Election Board last month passed the rule requiring that three poll workers each count the paper ballots -- not votes -- by hand after the polls close. The county election board in Cobb County, in Atlanta's suburbs, had filed a lawsuit seeking to have a judge declare that rule and five others recently passed by the state board invalid, saying they exceed the state board's authority, weren't adopted in compliance with the law and are unreasonable.In a ruling late Tuesday, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney wrote, that the so-called hand count rule \"is too much, too late\" and blocked its enforcement while he considers the merits of the case.McBurney on Monday had ruled in a separate case that \"no election superintendent (or member of a board of elections and registration) may refuse to certify or abstain from certifying election results under any circumstance.\" While they are entitled to inspect the conduct of an election and to review related documents, he wrote, \"any delay in receiving such information is not a basis for refusing to certify the election results or abstaining from doing so.\"Georgia law says county election superintendents -- generally multimember boards -- \"shall\" certify election results by 5pm on the Monday after an election, or the Tuesday if Monday is a holiday as it is this year.The two rulings are victories for Democrats, liberal voting rights groups and some legal experts who have raised concerns that Donald Trump's allies could refuse to certify the results if the former president loses to Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in next month's presidential election.They have also argued that new rules enacted by the Trump-endorsed majority on the State Election Board could be used to stop or delay certification and to undermine public confidence in the results.",

    "title": "Presidential Preview: Health care",
    "content": "In advance of the 2024 presidential election, The Chronicle is breaking down each candidate's stance on priority issues, examining their platform and political history to keep voters in the Duke and Durham community informed. This week, we take a look at health care:Editor's note: The Chronicle is dedicating separate Presidential Previews to examining the major candidates' plans on reproductive rights and the opioid crisis.While health care may not be a deciding factor in this election, it still ranks highly in terms of voters' priorities.One of the biggest health policy issues this election cycle is the high cost of care, with policies focused on lowering prescription drug prices and making insurance more affordable. The future of the Affordable Care Act -- commonly referred to as Obamacare -- is also in question this election cycle.Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris have both framed their approach to health policy around making care more affordable, though they present distinctly different plans for doing so.Health care remains a top priority for North Carolina, which has been recognized as \"arguably the most innovative state in the country\" in the field. A Sept. 11 poll conducted by WRAL and SurveyUSA found that health care was the top priority for Democrats and ranked highly for Republicans, though not the number-one issue.However, the state faces significant challenges, with 9.4% of North Carolina residents uninsured in 2022 compared to 8% nationwide. Additionally, 1,090,000 adults -- 13.4% of the state's adult population -- reported having medical debt between 2019 and 2021, well above the national average at the time of 8.6%. In August, North Carolina announced plans to leverage Medicaid through a first-of-its-kind program to relieve medical debt.Harris' health care platform focuses primarily on making services more affordable by lowering prescription drug costs, strengthening Medicare and providing medical debt relief.For her 2024 campaign, Harris is building on her record as a prosecutor in California, where she used antitrust laws to go after health insurance providers, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies that consolidated to raise costs. As the state's attorney general from 2011 to 2016, she secured multimillion-dollar settlements from Quest Diagnostics and McKesson for overcharging consumers.Later on as a senator, she co-sponsored the Medicare for All bill, which would have established a nationally mandated health insurance plan. Harris proposed a similar program as part of her 2020 presidential bid, though her version would not have eliminated private insurance entirely.Many of the Democratic nominee's current proposals expand upon initiatives already implemented by the Biden-Harris administration.If elected this November, Harris' approach to reducing the cost of care will rely largely on expanding the ACA by extending premium subsidies -- federal assistance for health care costs -- a stance she has backed since her 2020 presidential bid.Under the American Rescue Plan Act, which was implemented in 2021 as part of a broader effort to provide economic relief during the COVID-19 pandemic, ACA Marketplace subsidies were temporarily increased and made available to a wider range of people. Tax credits increased for those with incomes up to 400% of the FPL, and those earning above that benchmark -- who were previously ineligible for marketplace subsidies to reduce their health insurance premiums -- had their health care plan contributions capped at 8.5% of household income.The changes were designed to only be in effect for 2021 and 2022. However, the Inflation Reduction Act was passed in 2022, featuring provisions to extend the enhanced ACA subsidies through 2025.The Democratic nominee has proposed to cap out-of-pocket prescription drug expenses for all Americans at $2,000 per year, a limit the Biden-Harris administration has already implemented for seniors. One of the administration's key achievements, which Harris frequently highlights, is capping the monthly cost of insulin at $35 for Medicare beneficiaries -- a cap that she promises to extend to all Americans if elected.Harris also hopes to strengthen the federal government's ability to negotiate lower drug prices. The IRA included a provision allowing the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service to negotiate the prices of certain drugs directly with pharmaceutical companies. Ten drugs have been selected for the first round of Medicare price negotiations, with agreements reached on new, lower prices that will take effect in 2026. These medications are among the most expensive and widely used in the Medicare program, treating conditions ranging from heart disease and diabetes to arthritis and cancer.A Harris presidency would likely continue to strengthen protections against high out-of-pocket health care costs and medical debt.In March, the Biden-Harris administration implemented a rule reinstating restrictions on short-term health insurance plans, which often put people at risk of inadequate coverage when they are used longer than intended. Harris also played an active role in the administration's proposal to remove medical debt from consumer credit reports.In line with her continued effort to highlight women's issues, Harris also aims to combat rising maternal mortality rates. As vice president in 2022, she announced the White House Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis, which outlined 50 federal actions to improve maternal health care. She also called upon states to extend Medicaid postpartum coverage from two months to 12 months -- which 46 states now do -- and supported an over-$500 million award from the Department of Health and Human Services to improve maternal health.During his Sept. 10 debate with Harris, Donald Trump famously stated that he had \"concepts of a plan\" for health care reform should he secure a second term, leaving the actual details undefined.Trump's past record on health care policy is somewhat mixed.As president in 2017, he led an unsuccessful attempt to repeal and replace the ACA, which would have resulted in over 50 million Americans becoming uninsured. However, in recent years, Republican support for repealing the ACA has diminished.Trump has since revised his stance, no longer seeking to dismantle the law entirely but instead pledging to improve it. In a video posted on his social media platform Truth Social, he promised to make the ACA \"much better, stronger and far less expensive.\"One of Trump's notable health care achievements during his first term was the signing of the bipartisan No Surprises Act in December 2020. The law protects patients from unexpected medical bills when they receive out-of-network care, such as during emergencies or when treated by out-of-network specialists in in-network hospitals.The Republican nominee's 2024 platform promises to make health care more affordable by \"increas transparency  promot choice and competition.\" He also promises to \"protect Medicare\" as part of his larger plan to support seniors.Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, has since provided more insight into what a second Trump administration's approach to health care policy could look like.In a September interview, he advocated for more personalized \"risk pools\" that lump individuals with similar levels of health risk together in one insurance market to calculate their premiums. Unlike the current system under the ACA, which established one risk pool designed to have healthier individuals help subsidize the costs of those with more complex medical needs, this approach isolates higher-risk individuals into their own insurance pool.The new model would likely result in lower premiums for healthier individuals, but those with chronic conditions could see significantly higher costs, as their insurance pools would consist of higher-risk patients in need of more care. As costs rise, healthier individuals may opt out of the pool, leaving behind only the sickest individuals, which would drive premiums even higher. Critics argue that this approach could make comprehensive coverage prohibitively expensive and that lower-cost plans would offer minimal benefits, reducing meaningful coverage options for everyone.Another key issue Trump may revisit is imposing work requirements for Medicaid recipients. Under this policy, individuals would need to meet specific employment or community service criteria to maintain their coverage. When work requirements were previously attempted, such as in Arkansas in 2018, the policy led to substantial coverage losses, drawing criticism from health care advocates.Independent candidate Cornel West has emphasized his commitment to improving Black maternal health and advocates for the \"nationalization of health care industries\" as a means to \"prioritize people's welfare over corporate profit margins.\" His health platform features a proposal titled \"Beyond Medicare for All,\" though the specific policies remain unclear.Libertarian Party candidate Chase Oliver advocates for reducing government regulation in health care. He supports alternatives to employer-provided insurance and calls for lowering the \"regulatory burden on the pharmaceutical industry.\" Oliver also seeks to end practices like evergreen patents, which he argues keep drug prices artificially high.Green Party nominee Jill Stein supports a universal health care system, calling for a \"National Improved Medicare for All\" program. She also proposes canceling all medical debt and expanding funding for federal health agencies.",

    "content": "NEW YORK / VENEZUELA - Human rights abuses have increased in the past year in Venezuela, a report by the UN Fact-Finding Mission on the country shows, citing arbitrary detentions, torture and violence against children.The new report expands on findings presented in September to the Human Rights Council in Geneva. It documents a pattern of escalated human rights violations committed by Venezuelan security forces, government officials, and pro-government armed civilian groups, known as \"colectivos,\" in the wake of Venezuela's contested July 2024 presidential election.Coordinated repressionThe Mission's findings reveal a coordinated effort to target perceived political opponents. Abuses \"were committed as part of a coordinated plan to silence, discourage and quash opposition to the government of president Maduro,\" investigators reported.The Human Rights Council-mandated Mission found that detainees, including children and people with disabilities, were threatened, in some instances with acts of torture, to self-incriminate for serious crimes, such as terrorism. Many were denied access to legal representation, leaving them vulnerable to harsh penalties and prolonged detention.Particularly serious is the number of detained minors, who faced the same threats as adults, with the report noting they \"did not benefit from the procedural guarantees afforded to them by the Organic Law for the Protection of Children and Adolescents and by international norms and standards.\"Crimes against humanityThe Mission's report confirms that some of the human rights violations documented during this period qualify as crimes against humanity, including persecutions on political grounds.At least 25 people were killed, hundreds were injured, and thousands remain detained for exercising their fundamental right to freedom of expression, the report reveals.The Mission concludes by calling for the immediate release of all individuals arbitrarily detained and urges the Venezuelan government to respect the physical and psychological integrity of detainees. International attention to protect children in these circumstances is also emphasised.The Independent International Fact-Finding Mission will continue to investigate the situation as requested by the Human Rights Council in a recent decision to extend their mandate for another two years.The Mission was established by the Council in September 2019 to assess alleged human rights violations committed in Venezuela since 2014.It consists of three experts who are not UN staff, receive no payment for their work, and do not represent any government or organization.",

    "title": "The Apprentice director responds after Trump lashes biopic as 'defamatory'",
    "content": "The director of a new biopic documenting a key phase of Donald Trump's life has responded after it was hammered by the former president.The film, titled The Apprentice, was theatrically released in Australia and the United States last week with Sebastian Stan - known predominantly for his role as Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier in the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise - starring as Trump.The Apprentice chronicles Trump's career as a real estate businessman in New York through the 1970s and 1980s with a supporting cast of Jeremy Strong as lawyer Roy Cohn, Maria Bakalova as Trump's first wife Ivana Trump, and Martin Donovan as Fred Trump Sr, Donald's father.Ali Abbasi, director of the biographical film, was interviewed on the red carpet of the London premiere on Tuesday where he laughed off Trump's brutal criticism as good publicity.\"We're trying to raise more money to give it to him and see if we can do a deal for him, (to) do a few tweets more,\" Abbasi told 9honey Celebrity.Abbasi claimed he had also received legal letters from Trump's team.Trump shared a lengthy post on Truth Social earlier in the week condemning the movie as \"fake\" and \"classless\" and said he hoped it would bomb.\"It's a cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country, \"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" Trump posted.\"My former wife, Ivana, was a kind and wonderful person, and I had a great relationship with her until the day she died. The writer of this pile of garbage, Gabe Sherman, a lowlife and talentless hack, who has long been widely discredited, knew that, but chose to ignore it.\"So sad that HUMAN SCUM, like the people involved in this hopefully unsuccessful enterprise, are allowed to say and do whatever they want in order to hurt a Political Movement, which is far bigger than any of us. MAGA2024!\"Strong said while Trump's comments were arguably good marketing for the film, it was concerning that he was using language such as \"human scum\".\"I think his response was really troubling,\" he told AFP at the premiere.While The Apprentice is yet to be released completely across the world yet, it has so far made back $2.2 million of its $16 million budget in the box office.It has a 6.9/10 rating on IMDB and a 79 per cent review score on Rotten Tomatoes.",

Trump's also been a frequent visitor, with rallies in Scranton and Reading less than a week ago.Pennsylvania, along with Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada, had razor-thin margins that decided Biden's 2020 victory over Trump. And the seven states will likely determine whether Harris or Trump wins the 2024 presidential election.\nBut with 19 electoral votes at stake, Pennsylvania's the biggest of the key battlegrounds. And while the campaigns and their allied super PACs are pouring resources into all seven states, more money has been spent running spots in Pennsylvania than any of the other battlegrounds, according to figures from AdImpact, a top national ad tracking firm.Pennsylvania, along with Michigan and Wisconsin, are the three Rust Belt states that make up the Democrats' so-called \"Blue Wall.\"The party reliably won all three states for a quarter-century before Trump narrowly captured them in the 2016 election to win the White House.Four years later, in 2020, Biden carried all three states to put them back in the Democrats' column and defeated Trump.",

    "title": "If Kamala Harris is trying to show she can meet the needs of Black America, she has gaps to fill | Shamira Ibrahim",
    "content": "The Democratic nominee is turning her attention to Black men - but her insistence that 'we can do it all' is undercut by realityAs we enter the final 21 days of the 2024 presidential election, the euphoric sheen from the summer's \"Kamala is Brat\" phenomenon, which resonated with large swaths of gen Z voters, has waned. The Harris campaign is scrambling to communicate its case for selection at the polls, with the vice-president hurriedly pushing out platforms that address lingering skepticism amongst various demographic groups. On Tuesday night, during a broadcast conversation with the radio host Charlamagne tha God, Harris turned her attention to Black men.Harris's concern is not completely unfounded - several notable Black male celebrities, such as the rapper 50 Cent and the sports personality Stephen A Smith, have expressed their receptiveness to the Trump campaign. On the aggregate, there has been a dip in support: a New York Times/Siena College poll of likely Black voters reported that 78% of all Black voters expressed an interest in voting for Harris, which would be a significantly smaller turnout than the 90% of Black people who voted for Joe Biden in 2020. The most pronounced drop comes from Black men, 85% of whom turned out for the US president in the last election and just 70% of whom now say they would vote for Harris.In the hour-long interview, Charlamagne, whose daily morning show The Breakfast Club reaches a predominantly Black audience of 8 million listeners monthly, prodded Harris on topics spanning reparations, criminal justice reform, economic inequality and the fearmongering of the Trump campaign. Harris homed in on her consistent talking points about the necessity of voter participation, a proposed influx of capital for the middle class and misinformation, responses that felt stale and limited. But at other times, her replies landed with impact: when asked about issues specific to Black people that she would prioritize, Harris stressed initiatives around Black maternal mortality and the child tax credit as long neglected needs.In a few cases, Harris's answers felt like fitting a square peg into a round hole. When asked by a caller how she intends to address the homelessness crisis in the US when the current administration seems to overemphasize foreign interests such as the Israel-Gaza war, the Democratic nominee deflected, punting back to her well-tread lines on home ownership and small business loans.The full exchange, which aired on iHeartRadio's podcast platform and was simulcast on CNN, both reflected Harris's best assets and underscored her biggest flaws as a candidate. She remains unflappable on her key points - including the idea that Trump is an existential threat to democracy and Black advancement - and she's deft at articulating the possibilities and limitations of the government.But her inability to veer away from her entrenched positions or to adequately explain how they could substantively apply to the poor and working class, where Black communities are disproportionately represented, leaves much to be desired. If Harris's aim is to squash the nagging perspective that she will be unable to meet the needs of Black America, then she still has a gap to fill. Her insistence that \"we can do it all\" is undercut by the reality that a large part of the Black working class is struggling with unemployment, homelessness, and other critical issues that prevent successful class migration.Yesterday, Harris's campaign released the Opportunity Agenda for Black Men, a five-point platform focused on Black entrepreneurship, mentorship, marijuana legislation, and cryptocurrency. The platform came on the heels of a contentious lecture from Barack Obama to Black men in Pittsburgh, where the former president alleged that they \"just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that\".Whether misogyny is a factor in Harris's current polling numbers or it isn't, the emphasis on Black men feels overstated. The Black population accounts for barely 13% of the country, with high distribution in metropolitan areas that skew predominantly Democratic, while white and non-Black populations have voted for Trump at significantly higher rates.Despite this disconnect, the Harris campaign has responded with an aggressive media blitz of interviews and campaign stops directly targeted at Black communities. As a result many Black voters are ultimately left with the idea of voting as a means of harm reduction and not one of enthusiasm. For all of Harris's insistence that the Trump campaign thrives on driving fear, the most animating influence on her campaign's push to get Black voters to the polls seems to be fear as well.",

Afghanistan was a disaster, the Middle East is basically in flames, you got Russia,\" Portnoy said.\"Then on the homeland, inflation's out of control, people burning American flags in the streets...law and order doesn't even seem to matter anymore, you got border, immigration.\"Portnoy - who has an estimated net worth around $150 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth - built his wealth by selling his media company Barstool Sports for $551 million in 2023 and buying it back for just $1 later that year.Barstool started as a Boston-based print publication and has since grown into a social media empire.\"Every once in a while, I get so fed up with politics, I got to do a rant and just let steam off. I try not to, but I've hit the boiling point,\" Portnoy said in his video.\"It's the gaslighting that the left is doing with Kamala Harris, making it sound like she's some great, groundbreaking candidate,\" he said. \"She is the worst candidate to ever run for president ever.\"\"El Presidente,\" as Portnoy calls himself, was a \"big fan\" of former Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley during her presidential run.Since Haley dropped out of the race in March, he has issued his support for former president Donald Trump. Though Portnoy ranted against Harris in his video, he prefaced that he does not like celebrity endorsements.The business mogul argued there are only two kinds of voters in the 2024 presidential election: those that are voting for Trump, and those that \"hate\" Trump and are voting against him.Americans who vote for Harris are \"voting against him  because you hate his guts and you'd vote for a potato or a head of lettuce or anything,\" Portnoy said.One of Portnoy's biggest gripes with Harris is that she is campaigning as a candidate for change.At multiple rallies, Harris has told the crowds that \"it's time to turn the page.\"\"This is the sitting vice president of the United States currently, saying she's the candidate for change,\" Portnoy said.He argued that Harris \"has to\" present herself as a candidate for change because most people agree that the last four years under President Joe Biden were a \"disaster.\"Portnoy also slammed Harris' recent media blitz, including appearances on the \"Call Her Daddy\" podcast, \"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert\" and \"The View.\"\"She's being asked the most simplest questions, softballs that she probably knew were coming,\" he said.For example, he said, Harris has been asked on a few talk shows how her presidency will differ from Biden's.\"She cannot answer it!\" Portnoy exclaimed. \"Kamala Harris can't even answer the easiest questions of all time. She never gives a straight answer. She doesn't seem to be able to put coherent thoughts together.\"",

    "content": "With 56 ongoing conflicts involving 92 nations worldwide, the world is getting much less peaceful. According to the latest available data, more people have perished in combat in the last year than at any time since the end of the Second World War.The Global Peace Index (GPI) is an annual study that measures and ranks the world's nations according to their peacefulness. The rankings are based on safety and security, ongoing conflicts, and militarism. While the latter two points are rising in the wrong direction, militarism is actually on the decline because armies are getting smaller. This article will examine the lowest-ranking nations and provide historical context and political analysis.Why This MattersEven the most bellicose nations on the planet are hardly likely to express a desire to wage war. The countries embroiled in active conflicts go to great lengths to proclaim their intentions are defensive in nature and wholly justified. Peace is a laudable and near-universal goal of the world's nations but it's also incredibly difficult to obtain. By looking at the historical and political context behind the most warlike countries, a clearer picture of achieving lasting, sustainable peace emerges. While the current trends are very much in the wrong direction, history will show that tension ebbs and flows as the balance of power shifts. American military hegemony is not as assured as it was so geopolitical contests intensify as the world adjusts.\"Very Low\" Nations 17-11The 2024 GPI rates the state of peace in 17 nations as \"very low.\" Nigeria (17) is one of the fastest-growing nations in the world but faces major security problems in the northeast. Myanmar (16) is three years into a civil war instigated by a 2021 coup by the military. The government of Burkina Faso (15) only controls around 60% of the country as it battles against Islamist rebels. The Central African Republic (14) has been embroiled in civil war since March 2013 with Muslim and Christian groups fighting for control. The first presidential elections in 35 years are due to be held in October 2024. Iraq (13) is still reeling from the 2003 conflict, and war with the Islamic State and is still dealing with the insurgency today. ISIS claimed responsibility for 153 attacks on Iraq and Syria from January to June 2024.North Korea is still technically at war with its southern neighbor though the active phase of the Korean War ended in 1953. The brutal authoritarian regime headed by Kim Jong-un routinely flouts international law. As Ukraine alleges North Korean troops are fighting alongside Russian soldiers in Ukraine, North Korea blew up the rail lines and roads linking North and South Korea in October 2024.Armed rebel groups doubled their territory in northern Mali in 2023, leaving the country on the brink of all-out civil war. The current crisis represents a new phase of a struggle that began in 2012 with the Tuareg rebellion. Nomadic rebels and Al-Qaeda allies seized much of northern Mali which led to a French-led intervention in 2013. Though Operation Serval defeated rebel forces and recaptured major Malian cities, securing long-term peace proved difficult.Operation Barkhane, an eight-year counterinsurgency operation in the Sahara ultimately failed. Anti-French protests in Bamako led to the expulsion of the French ambassador and France withdrawing forces from the region. They were followed by UN peacekeepers in 2023. Russian private military contractors from the Wagner Group arrived in 2022. Human rights groups accused the mercenaries of assisting the government in killing civilians.The power vacuum created allowed a resurgence of extremist violence in the Mahgreb region which continues today. Several Wagner members were killed in an ambush in July 2024. In September 2024, a group linked to Al-Qaeda attacked Bamako, leaving dozens dead and injured.9 - IsraelSince its modern inception, Israel has always been surrounded by hostile neighbors and frequently attacked by state and non-state actors alike. After the October 7th attacks which left 1,200 Israelis dead, Israel launched a counteroffensive to pacify the Gaza Strip. The ongoing campaign displaced almost two million people and has killed at least 41,000. Israel is also striking against Iranian proxies in the region and launched a cross-border incursion into Lebanon against Hezbollah in October 2024.Iran and Israel are coming dangerously close to open warfare with both nations launching attacks against one another in April 2024. Israel vowed to respond to Iran's latest missile attack in October 2024. While a wider regional conflict may not be the intended outcome, escalation from a proxy war to open conflict is all too easy a step to make.8 - SyriaAt least 500,000 people have died and six million have been displaced in the ongoing civil war in Syria. 2011 protests against Bashar al-Assad's regime escalated into a civil war between Assad's forces and a coalition of Islamist militants. As well as the civil war, several nations conduct air strikes and military operations on Syrian soil.Turkey conducted four cross-border incursions against Kurdish rebel groups from 2016-20 and is gearing up for another. Additionally, the United States, United Kingdom, and France have launched over 11,000 air strikes on targets in Syria since 2015. Russian and Iranian forces are also present in Syria to prop up Assad's regime. Though Moscow insists it only provides air support, the mercenary Wagner Group was deployed to protect Russian interests in the region. More recently, Israel has been attacking Iranian targets in Syria.The impact of this multifaceted regional conflict on the local population is predictably devastating. A refugee crisis, dire poverty, and rampant food insecurity are all part of the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Syria. A 2023 earthquake at the Turkish-Syrian border disrupted a vital land bridge for humanitarian aid.7 - RussiaAs the aggressor in an ongoing conflict, perhaps the only surprise is that Russia isn't further down the rankings of the GPI. Russia fares better than its unpeaceful peers in terms of displaced people, internal conflicts, violent demonstrations, and weapons imports. As the GPI doesn't account for the latest developments in the ongoing war, the consequences of the Kursk incursion aren't counted here. Similarly, the latest casualty figures aren't accounted for yet.September 2024 was the deadliest month yet for Russian forces in Ukraine. After the swift victory did not materialize, Russia pivoted towards a strategy of attrition and accepted mounting losses to wear down Ukraine. Accordingly, Russia has paid a heavy price in blood and treasure. The latest casualty estimates put Russian losses at over 600,000 dead and wounded.6 - Democratic Republic of the CongoSix million people have died in conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 1996. In the First Congo War (1996-97) a coalition of African states and internal Congolese opponents successfully ended autocrat Mobutu Sese Seko's 26-year reign. However, the relations between the allies soon broke down and the Second Congo War (1998-2005) broke out a year later. It was the deadliest war fought since World War Two.The President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Laurent Kabila, was assassinated in 2001 and succeeded by his son. Joseph Kabila headed the transitional government that ended the war but regional violence is still rife within the DRC. Armed rebel groups control large swathes of the country and tensions with neighboring Rwanda are at boiling point. Over seven million people have been displaced since 2023 by the ongoing turmoil.5 - UkraineThe Ukraine-Russia war is nearing its third year. However, the Russian invasion is really just a more active phase of a long conflict between Kyiv and Moscow. Ukraine's stout resistance against the initial onslaught confounded expectations of a swift Russian victory. However, the war is taking a major toll on Ukraine's population as Russia pivots to a strategy of attrition. Millions have been displaced and Ukraine's GDP has predictably nosedived.Much will hinge on the outcome of the 2024 Presidential election as Ukraine's war effort relies heavily on foreign. A Ukraine-skeptic White House may well force an unfavorable settled peace while a more sympathetic outcome may only serve to prolong the struggle.4 - AfghanistanThe United States withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021, ending a 20-year war. However, the end of the conflict did not bring peace to Afghanistan. The weak government propped by the United States soon fell and the Taliban regained power. Foreign aid no longer comes to the diplomatically isolated regime. Accordingly, Afghanistan faces dire food shortages and a failing healthcare system as well as millions of displaced people.In the first two years of Taliban rule, the government carried out over one thousand instances of violence against its own citizens. Despite promises of amnesty for former government and security officials in August 2021, at least 400 violent attacks against members of the previous government were recorded from 2021-23, and 290 were by the Taliban. Journalists, prisoners, and women were also subjected to extrajudicial violence. None of the promises made by the Taliban have been kept. With few nations recognizing the regime and simmering tensions at the border with Pakistan, Afghanistan's troubles are far from over.3 - South SudanSouth Sudan is the world's newest country but old problems die hard. The 2005 peace agreement that ended the second Sudanese Civil War included a provision for a future independence referendum. In January 2011, 99% of South Sudanese voters backed independence.A power struggle between President Salva Kiir and Vice President Riek Machar ignited into a civil war in 2013. 400,000 people died as both sides carried out atrocities and regularly violated ceasefires. Kiir and Machar formed a unity government in 2020 to end hostilities but violence is still ever-present in South Sudan. Refugees escaping the ongoing civil war in Sudan are placing the country's already limited resources at breaking point. South Sudan is considered the most dangerous place in the world for aid workers.2 - SudanSudan is a country that has lurched from one catastrophe to another since the 1950s. The first Sudanese Civil War lasted almost 17 years from 1955-72. The war erupted as Sudan was about to break free from British rule. The vast country had a major cultural divide between the Muslim north and the Christian and animist south. Up to one million people perished in the conflict. The Addis Ababa Agreement ended the fighting albeit temporarily. The Second Sudanese Civil War broke out in 1983 and lasted 21 years with an estimated 1-2 million fatalities.Omar al-Bashir seized power in a coup in 1989 and ruled as a dictator for 30 years before he was toppled in 2019. Osama bin Laden and other terrorist leaders lived in Sudan in the 1990s, this caused the United States to sever ties with Sudan in 1996 and impose sanctions.Over 200,000 people were systematically killed in the Darfur region between 2003-05 by the Janjaweed militia and the Sudanese government. After al-Bashir was removed from power in a 2019 uprising, the new government was toppled again by a coup led by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in 2021.The third Sudanese civil war broke out in April 2023 over a power struggle between the SAF and RSF. Some eight million people were displaced by the fighting. As the war rages, there are serious warnings that another genocide could be carried out in Darfur.1 - YemenYemen has the unwanted distinction of being the least peaceful nation on earth. The UN described the unfolding situation in Yemen as the worst humanitarian crisis in the world in 2021. The crisis has left two-thirds of the country's 33 million people needing humanitarian assistance. Yemen's multi-faceted troubles go back several years. An insurgency by Al-Qaeda in 1998 eventually led to an attack on the USS Cole in October 2000. 17 American sailors perished in a suicide attack by the terrorist group. Since 2002, the United States has carried out over 400 anti-terrorist strikes in Yemen.Civil War (2014-present)The Iranian-backed Houthis rose up in rebellion in 2004 and this escalated into a civil war in 2014 which still rages today. The Houthis seized the capital in October 2014, leading to intervention by a Saudi-led coalition in 2015. A naval blockade was imposed to prevent weapons shipments from arriving from Iran which led to critical food shortages. The conflict is something of a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. China mediated talks in May 2023 to restore diplomatic relations between the two countries.Recent DevelopmentsAnother faction in the conflict is the Southern Transitional Council (STC), a secessionist group backed by the United Arab Emirates. The STC seized Aden in 2018 but worked out a power-sharing agreement in 2020. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) carried out a series of attacks on the SLC and killed a senior commander in August 2023.Houthi delegates traveled to Saudi Arabia in September 2023 to work out a timetable for Saudi withdrawal and a lasting peace. However, the October 7 attack by Hamas on Israel spilled over into the Arabian peninsula. The Houthis began attacking foreign shipping which in turn led to US-UK operations against the Houthis in January 2024. The Israeli Air Force struck Hudayah, a major port city in Yemen and a crucial source of humanitarian aid, in September 2024.Conclusion17 nations have a \"very low\" status on the Global Peace Index. It should be noted the 2024 study does not represent the very latest developments so escalations in ongoing conflicts are not reflected in the results.As with the most peaceful nations, geography is an important factor. Israel's location and proximity to hostile non-state actors make achieving lasting peace challenging. Nearby Syria and Iraq have multiple armed groups fighting within their territory and contending with foreign interventions. While countries in central Europe and Scandinavia tend to be the most peaceful, the reverse is true for sub-Saharan Africa. The Central African Republic shares a border with Sudan, South Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and their troubles often overlap. Similarly, Mali and Burkina Faso are neighbors in one of the most troubled spots on the continent.The only surprise concerning Russia and Ukraine's inclusion is that they're not further down the pecking order. The recent arrival of F-16s and the potential delivery of long-range munitions in Ukraine could usher in a more dangerous phase of the war. Yemen's unwanted position at the foot of the table stems from long-term factors and more recent developments. Its key strategic position within the Gulf of Aden means it will always invite outside influence. Global trends may seem to be moving in an alarming direction but such ebbs and flows are quite typical historically and times of crisis are often followed by lengthy periods of calm. It is up to the wider global community to realize that possibility.",

    "title": "Trump's Betting Odds Surge in Key Swing States, Outpacing Polls with Strong Lead",
    "content": "With just weeks left until the 2024 presidential election, new data from election betting platforms and polling sites indicate that former President Donald Trump is gaining significant momentum in battleground states. According to Polymarket, Trump currently holds a commanding lead in Pennsylvania (+9%), Michigan (+6%), Wisconsin (+4%), Georgia (+27%), Arizona (+36%), and North Carolina (+25%). Although Vice President Kamala Harris maintains a narrow 1% edge in Nevada, national betting odds favor Trump by an impressive +10.8%, marking the highest lead by any candidate since July.Trump's strong performance in these swing states aligns closely with RealClearPolling's latest averages, which also show Trump leading in five out of seven battlegrounds. Polls reveal Trump narrowly ahead in Pennsylvania (+0.3%), Michigan (+0.9%), Georgia (+0.5%), Arizona (+1.1%), and North Carolina (+0.5%). While both the odds and polls predict a tight race, the betting markets suggest a decisive electoral advantage for Trump. If the election results match current odds, Trump would secure 306 electoral votes -- comfortably exceeding the 270 needed to win.The data also highlight notable discrepancies between the odds and state polling. In Nevada, where Harris holds a slight edge among bettors, polling gives Trump a 0.2% lead. Similarly, while the betting markets show Trump leading in Wisconsin, state polls currently place Harris 0.3% ahead. These inconsistencies underscore the unpredictability of the election's final stretch, where both sides are vying for every last vote.Beyond the presidential race, Republicans are emerging as favorites to reclaim control of the Senate. Betting odds tracked by Maxim Lott and John Stossel show the GOP with a 56-point advantage -- up from a 37-point lead just 10 days earlier. Meanwhile, Democrats are still favored to retain the House, but their advantage has narrowed to 10.5 points, a significant drop from the 25-point lead reported on October 4.The sharp increase in Trump's odds reflects more than just momentum. His ability to resonate with voters in critical states could have profound implications for the broader political landscape. If current betting trends hold, Republicans will gain ground in the Senate while Democrats struggle to maintain control of the House.As Election Day approaches, Trump's campaign is capitalizing on both favorable polls and betting trends, suggesting that public sentiment is shifting in his favor. The big question remains: will the betting odds accurately predict another Trump victory, or will the polls prove more reliable? With both indicators pointing toward a potential Trump win, the pressure is mounting on Harris to reverse the narrative before it's too late.",

    "content": "The 2024 Presidential election is only three weeks away. It's the homestretch for candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.Harris, the current Vice President and Democratic nominee, is aiming to increase her support from male voters, particularly young males, as she makes her final campaign push. This has led her to reportedly consider appearing on the Joe Rogan's popular podcast, \"The Joe Rogan Experience.\" Reuters broke the news Tuesday that Harris' team had been in contact with Rogan about a potential appearance soon.\"Harris campaign officials, in the final stretch of the U.S. presidential campaign, met with Rogan's team this week but an appearance has not been confirmed yet, said two of the sources, who have knowledge of the matter,\" Reuters wrote.According to a 2023 YouGov poll, Rogan's audience is 81% male and 56% under the age of 35. Rogan, who has a massive contract with Spotify, has a cordial relationship with Trump, who said this week he intends to appear on \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" before Nov. 5.However, back in August, Rogan predicted that Harris would win the upcoming election.\"She's gonna win,\" Rogan said at the time, via OutKick. \"I feel like we are in this very bizarre time where people are giving into the  in a way that I never suspected people would before.

    "title": "How Trump and Harris Aim to Address Your Health Care | FOX 28 Spokane",
    "content": "Health care has largely taken a back seat during the presidential campaign and the lack of focus has left the public wanting more.Two in three Americans (67%) surveyed by Gallup and West Health (Sept. 9-16) say that health care is getting too little focus in the 2024 presidential election. Democrats are more likely (78%) than Republicans (53%) to say health care hasn't received enough attention.That response is likely because the candidates have been light on the details when it comes to most topics concerning health care in America:Harris has focused on lowering prescription drug prices; expanding Medicare coverage for long-term care; working with states to cancel medical debt; and supporting the restoration of federal abortion rights.Trump says he supports IVF coverage, but abortion should be left to the states. And during the Sept. 10 debate he said that he has only a \"concept\" of a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act.Both candidates promise to protect Medicare.According to a September poll by Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), the health care-related issues that voters most care about include abortion (7%); Medicare and Social Security (7%) and health care costs, including prescription drug costs (5%).Most of the candidates' proposals would only move forward with support from Congress. NerdWallet spoke with three health care policy experts to get their take on what Trump and Harris have in store for health care.Prescription drugsHarrisHarris has said she wants to lower prescription drug prices. Under 2022's Inflation Reduction Act, a provision allows Medicare to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. It also added a $2,000 cap on all out-of-pocket drug expenses. In addition, the Biden-Harris administration capped insulin at $35 for seniors. Harris wants to extend these cost-saving measures to all Americans. She also wants to expedite Medicare prescription drug negotiations. And she proposed to \"increase competition and demand transparency in the health care industry,\" according to her packet of economic policy proposals. The details on this are unclear.TrumpIn 2016, Trump campaigned on reducing drug prices. During his time in office, he supported several measures including capping insulin costs for certain Medicare recipients, and issued an executive order to make it easier to import inexpensive prescription drugs. But he also opposed letting Medicare negotiate drug prices for seniors. During this campaign, Trump said little about prescription drug costs. However, he did reverse his position on a promise he once made to link some Part B medications drug prices to what peer nations pay.What the experts sayJosh Bivens, chief economist at the Economic Policy Institute: He says Harris' plans seem realistic, especially expanding the insulin cap to more Americans. There's just some question of how her plans could be implemented.Richard Frank, director of the Center on Health Policy at Brookings Institution: Frank says there are two main areas where Harris can improve prescription drug costs. \"The first has to do with clearing out impediments to generic competition,\" he says. \"There are a variety of regulatory and industry strategies that serve to create frictions for generics drugs entering the market. And what that does is it effectively extends the exclusivity period and keeps prices high for prescription drugs that have been on the market for quite a while.\"\"The second part of that, the second competition piece has to do with biosimilars,\" he says. \"And generic drugs apply mostly to what are known as small molecule drugs -- those are drugs that usually come in the form of pills that we've been taking for most of our lives. The other type of drug are biologic products, and they are regulated differently. The Affordable Care Act created a pathway for biosimilars to enter the market and compete that is kind of like what we do for generics, but not exactly. And the regulations have been very slow to develop and they've been what turns out to be excessively cautious. And so what  might do is try to streamline the regulations and to use a sort of pro-competitive policy to try to reinvigorate the biosimilar market and create more competition for biological drugs that have been on the market for quite a while.\"Colleen Grogan, professor and co-director of the Center for Health Administration Studies at the University of Chicago: \"There are now 10 drugs that the federal government is able to negotiate over,\" she says. \"Now it only applies to Medicare, so that impacts the elderly and disabled who who are on Medicare. But Medicare is important because it often sets the stage for private insurance plans to follow and so if Medicare is able to negotiate good prices, then private insurers say, 'Hey, you know, we want those prices, too.' So it often has a broader effect than just Medicare; there is every intention that this is a stepping stone to a broader process of drug price negotiation.\"Grogan adds that it's still an open question whether Republicans in Congress will \nAffordable Care ActHarrisUnder Biden, ACA health care tax credits increased under both the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act. The effect of those tax credits was less expensive plans sold through ACA. Those tax credits are expiring at the end of 2025. Harris has promised to expand and make the credits permanent and there's appetite among Democrats in Congress to do so as well.What the experts sayBivens: \" really boosted enrollment quite a bit and made it a lot more affordable for many people.\" He says that while Harris would extend or make permanent the ACA premium tax credits, Trump is unlikely to do the same.Frank: He says that making ACA tax credits permanent would bring stability to the marketplaces. Frank adds that negotiating the package of ACA subsidies, as well as the expiring Trump tax provisions, will be a major thread in legislative activity next year. \"My guess is there will be some kind of a grand bargain, in part depending on how the election comes out, that creates a sort of revised constellation of those two sets of provisions on taxes and subsidies,\" he says.Grogan: \"Enrollment in the exchanges has gone way up since  and I think I think they would want to continue with that.\"Trump:During Trump's first term, he tried to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, but was unsuccessful. During the debate he said he has only \"concepts\" of a new plan. His running mate, JD Vance, later clarified during an NBC interview that Trump's plan would include deregulating insurance markets to promote competition.Bivens: \"My guess is that it will not be like the same kind of frontal assault on it that there was in 2017, but there will just be a lot of undermining of different provisions of it. I think  is very popular now; in 2017 it was still pretty new and more vulnerable.\"Frank: He says that Trump has no clear alternative plan and he's unsure of the appetite in Congress to take on the messiness and complexities of replacing the ACA.\"I think that the issue is that there are things that can be done to shrink the reach of the Affordable Care Act,\" says Frank. \"And there are things that were done in the last Trump administration to try to make it more difficult to sustain the markets in the Affordable Care Act. But those have largely been restored through various bipartisan legislation over the last few years and those markets are doing quite well. They're insuring more people than they ever have.\"Grogan: She says Trump is unlikely to pursue repealing the ACA and Republicans, in general, know it's not popular. However, she points out that in Project 2025 -- a blueprint for the next Republican president, which was released by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank -- there is a provision that would allow private insurance companies more flexibility around \"essential health benefits.\" She says, \"When you do that, what you're doing is indirectly allowing flexibility on risk rating -- that's not a popular approach.\" She adds that most Americans are happy to move away from preexisting conditions preventing health insurance eligibility or driving up costs of insurance.It's worth noting that Trump has tried to distance himself from Project 2025, but many former Trump administration officials were involved in creating the document.Long-term careHarris:Harris says she would expand Medicare to cover long-term care at home for seniors and those with disabilities who receive Medicare. That includes at-home services like home health aids, personal care attendants or state-certified direct care workers. She would also cover vision and hearing for recipients.She also wants to end the practice in which seniors' homes are seized by states following long-term Medicaid care; the proposal would require action by Congress. Harris also says the expanded benefits would be funded primarily by savings from her proposal to negotiate power with prescription drug companies.Trump:Trump hasn't publicly addressed long-term care, but the 2024 Republican Party platform includes a provision to protect Medicare and ensure seniors receive care without an excessive cost burden. Details are unclear.Bivens: \"The Biden-Harris administration tried to include something pretty big on long-term care in the Build Back Better Act. They had a really big increase on the order of $400 billion over 10 years for home-based health and community-based care services that are paid for through Medicaid, which would have provided a lot of relief for people looking for elder care.\"Health care costs and medical debtHarrisHarris says she's committed to working with states to relieve medical debt. Her package of economic policy proposals points to her work with cities and states to eliminate $7 billion of medical debt for nearly 3 million people.TrumpWhile in office, Trump signed the No Surprises Act to protect people from certain unexpected medical bills. The Republican Party platform for 2024 promises to \"increase transparency, promote choice and competition and expand access to new affordable health care and prescription drug options.\" The details are unclear.What the experts sayBivens: He says medical debt is likely to become a bigger political issue moving forward.\"I think it really is bubbling up from people's lived experiences,\" he says, adding \"I think the details will be a little hard to work out, but I think it's a real pressure point that politicians are going to feel like whoever takes a big swing at solving it will get some real rewards.\"Grogan: She says Harris' promise to eliminate medical debt is a viable one. So far, states have funneled funds from the American Rescue Plan to the local level and, ultimately, to hospitals to relieve medical debt.\"What's interesting to me about that is the subsidies are going to the hospitals because the hospitals are the major way in which people are taking out medical debt, and so that's important that people are getting that relief,\" she says. \"I'm a little bit troubled, to be honest, that it's the hospitals getting the subsidy.\"She says there should be regulations that prevent hospitals who receive subsidies from charging exorbitant prices to individuals. \"I'm worried that we're not taking that approach; we're just sort of throwing more money at the hospitals to behave in ways which I think are problematic.\"Reproductive rightsThe September KFF poll showed that most voters (61%) think that this year's election will have a major impact on abortion access in the U.S. The same portion of voters say they support restoring a nationwide right to abortion.HarrisHarris says she will bring back protections under Roe v.

Both are incorrect. In 2023, overdose deaths from all opioids, including fentanyl, killed 81,083 people, according to the Center for Disease Control. U.S. Customs and Border Protection says 27,000 pounds of fentanyl were seized in 2023 -- that's the total among 549,000 pounds of all drugs seized in 2023, the majority of which are methamphetamines and marijuana.

    "title": "How Trump and Harris Aim to Address Your Health Care",
    "content": "Health care has largely taken a back seat during the presidential campaign and the lack of focus has left the public wanting more.Two in three Americans (67%) surveyed by Gallup and West Health (Sept. 9-16) say that health care is getting too little focus in the 2024 presidential election. Democrats are more likely (78%) than Republicans (53%) to say health care hasn't received enough attention.That response is likely because the candidates have been light on the details when it comes to most topics concerning health care in America:Harris has focused on lowering prescription drug prices; expanding Medicare coverage for long-term care; working with states to cancel medical debt; and supporting the restoration of federal abortion rights. Trump says he supports IVF coverage, but abortion should be left to the states. And during the Sept. 10 debate he said that he has only a \"concept\" of a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act.Both candidates promise to protect Medicare.According to a September poll by Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), the health care-related issues that voters most care about include abortion (7%); Medicare and Social Security (7%) and health care costs, including prescription drug costs (5%).Most of the candidates' proposals would only move forward with support from Congress. NerdWallet spoke with three health care policy experts to get their take on what Trump and Harris have in store for health care.Prescription drugsHarrisHarris has said she wants to lower prescription drug prices. Under 2022's Inflation Reduction Act, a provision allows Medicare to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. It also added a $2,000 cap on all out-of-pocket drug expenses. In addition, the Biden-Harris administration capped insulin at $35 for seniors. Harris wants to extend these cost-saving measures to all Americans. She also wants to expedite Medicare prescription drug negotiations. And she proposed to \"increase competition and demand transparency in the health care industry,\" according to her packet of economic policy proposals. The details on this are unclear.TrumpIn 2016, Trump campaigned on reducing drug prices. During his time in office, he supported several measures including capping insulin costs for certain Medicare recipients, and issued an executive order to make it easier to import inexpensive prescription drugs. But he also opposed letting Medicare negotiate drug prices for seniors. During this campaign, Trump said little about prescription drug costs. However, he did reverse his position on a promise he once made to link some Part B medications drug prices to what peer nations pay.What the experts sayJosh Bivens, chief economist at the Economic Policy Institute: He says Harris' plans seem realistic, especially expanding the insulin cap to more Americans. There's just some question of how her plans could be implemented.Richard Frank, director of the Center on Health Policy at Brookings Institution: Frank says there are two main areas where Harris can improve prescription drug costs. \"The first has to do with clearing out impediments to generic competition,\" he says. \"There are a variety of regulatory and industry strategies that serve to create frictions for generics drugs entering the market. And what that does is it effectively extends the exclusivity period and keeps prices high for prescription drugs that have been on the market for quite a while.\"\"The second part of that, the second competition piece has to do with biosimilars,\" he says. \"And generic drugs apply mostly to what are known as small molecule drugs -- those are drugs that usually come in the form of pills that we've been taking for most of our lives. The other type of drug are biologic products, and they are regulated differently. The Affordable Care Act created a pathway for biosimilars to enter the market and compete that is kind of like what we do for generics, but not exactly. And the regulations have been very slow to develop and they've been what turns out to be excessively cautious. And so what  might do is try to streamline the regulations and to use a sort of pro-competitive policy to try to reinvigorate the biosimilar market and create more competition for biological drugs that have been on the market for quite a while.\"Colleen Grogan, professor and co-director of the Center for Health Administration Studies at the University of Chicago: \"There are now 10 drugs that the federal government is able to negotiate over,\" she says. \"Now it only applies to Medicare, so that impacts the elderly and disabled who who are on Medicare. But Medicare is important because it often sets the stage for private insurance plans to follow and so if Medicare is able to negotiate good prices, then private insurers say, 'Hey, you know, we want those prices, too.' So it often has a broader effect than just Medicare; there is every intention that this is a stepping stone to a broader process of drug price negotiation.\"Grogan adds that it's still an open question whether Republicans in Congress will \nAffordable Care ActHarrisUnder Biden, ACA health care tax credits increased under both the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act. The effect of those tax credits was less expensive plans sold through ACA. Those tax credits are expiring at the end of 2025. Harris has promised to expand and make the credits permanent and there's appetite among Democrats in Congress to do so as well.What the experts sayBivens: \" really boosted enrollment quite a bit and made it a lot more affordable for many people.\" He says that while Harris would extend or make permanent the ACA premium tax credits, Trump is unlikely to do the same.Frank: He says that making ACA tax credits permanent would bring stability to the marketplaces. Frank adds that negotiating the package of ACA subsidies, as well as the expiring Trump tax provisions, will be a major thread in legislative activity next year. \"My guess is there will be some kind of a grand bargain, in part depending on how the election comes out, that creates a sort of revised constellation of those two sets of provisions on taxes and subsidies,\" he says.Grogan: \"Enrollment in the exchanges has gone way up since  and I think I think they would want to continue with that.\"Trump:During Trump's first term, he tried to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, but was unsuccessful. During the debate he said he has only \"concepts\" of a new plan. His running mate, JD Vance, later clarified during an NBC interview that Trump's plan would include deregulating insurance markets to promote competition.Bivens: \"My guess is that it will not be like the same kind of frontal assault on it that there was in 2017, but there will just be a lot of undermining of different provisions of it. I think  is very popular now; in 2017 it was still pretty new and more vulnerable.\"Frank: He says that Trump has no clear alternative plan and he's unsure of the appetite in Congress to take on the messiness and complexities of replacing the ACA.\"I think that the issue is that there are things that can be done to shrink the reach of the Affordable Care Act,\" says Frank. \"And there are things that were done in the last Trump administration to try to make it more difficult to sustain the markets in the Affordable Care Act. But those have largely been restored through various bipartisan legislation over the last few years and those markets are doing quite well. They're insuring more people than they ever have.\"Grogan: She says Trump is unlikely to pursue repealing the ACA and Republicans, in general, know it's not popular. However, she points out that in Project 2025 -- a blueprint for the next Republican president, which was released by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank -- there is a provision that would allow private insurance companies more flexibility around \"essential health benefits.\" She says, \"When you do that, what you're doing is indirectly allowing flexibility on risk rating -- that's not a popular approach.\" She adds that most Americans are happy to move away from preexisting conditions preventing health insurance eligibility or driving up costs of insurance.It's worth noting that Trump has tried to distance himself from Project 2025, but many former Trump administration officials were involved in creating the document.Long-term careHarris:Harris says she would expand Medicare to cover long-term care at home for seniors and those with disabilities who receive Medicare. That includes at-home services like home health aids, personal care attendants or state-certified direct care workers. She would also cover vision and hearing for recipients.She also wants to end the practice in which seniors' homes are seized by states following long-term Medicaid care; the proposal would require action by Congress. Harris also says the expanded benefits would be funded primarily by savings from her proposal to negotiate power with prescription drug companies.Trump:Trump hasn't publicly addressed long-term care, but the 2024 Republican Party platform includes a provision to protect Medicare and ensure seniors receive care without an excessive cost burden. Details are unclear.Bivens: \"The Biden-Harris administration tried to include something pretty big on long-term care in the Build Back Better Act. They had a really big increase on the order of $400 billion over 10 years for home-based health and community-based care services that are paid for through Medicaid, which would have provided a lot of relief for people looking for elder care.\"Health care costs and medical debtHarrisHarris says she's committed to working with states to relieve medical debt. Her package of economic policy proposals points to her work with cities and states to eliminate $7 billion of medical debt for nearly 3 million people.TrumpWhile in office, Trump signed the No Surprises Act to protect people from certain unexpected medical bills. The Republican Party platform for 2024 promises to \"increase transparency, promote choice and competition and expand access to new affordable health care and prescription drug options.\" The details are unclear.What the experts sayBivens: He says medical debt is likely to become a bigger political issue moving forward.\"I think it really is bubbling up from people's lived experiences,\" he says, adding \"I think the details will be a little hard to work out, but I think it's a real pressure point that politicians are going to feel like whoever takes a big swing at solving it will get some real rewards.\"Grogan: She says Harris' promise to eliminate medical debt is a viable one. So far, states have funneled funds from the American Rescue Plan to the local level and, ultimately, to hospitals to relieve medical debt.\"What's interesting to me about that is the subsidies are going to the hospitals because the hospitals are the major way in which people are taking out medical debt, and so that's important that people are getting that relief,\" she says. \"I'm a little bit troubled, to be honest, that it's the hospitals getting the subsidy.\"She says there should be regulations that prevent hospitals who receive subsidies from charging exorbitant prices to individuals. \"I'm worried that we're not taking that approach; we're just sort of throwing more money at the hospitals to behave in ways which I think are problematic.\"Reproductive rightsThe September KFF poll showed that most voters (61%) think that this year's election will have a major impact on abortion access in the U.S. The same portion of voters say they support restoring a nationwide right to abortion.HarrisHarris says she will bring back protections under Roe v. Wade and would ensure there would never be a federal abortion ban. Harris says she'll protect access in vitro fertilization (IVF).TrumpTrump says states should set their own laws.He says he would veto any federal abortion ban.

    "content": "Human rights abuses have increased in the past year in Venezuela, a report by the UN Fact-Finding Mission on the country shows, citing arbitrary detentions, torture and violence against children.The new report expands on findings presented in September to the Human Rights Council in Geneva. It documents a pattern of escalated human rights violations committed by Venezuelan security forces, government officials, and pro-government armed civilian groups, known as \"colectivos,\" in the wake of Venezuela's contested July 2024 presidential election.The Mission's findings reveal a coordinated effort to target perceived political opponents. Abuses \"were committed as part of a coordinated plan to silence, discourage and quash opposition to the Government of President Maduro,\" investigators reported.The Human Rights Council-mandated Mission found that detainees, including children and people with disabilities, were threatened, in some instances with acts of torture, to self-incriminate for serious crimes, such as terrorism. Many were denied access to legal representation, leaving them vulnerable to harsh penalties and prolonged detention.Particularly serious is the number of detained minors, who faced the same threats as adults, with the report noting they \"did not benefit from the procedural guarantees afforded to them by the Organic Law for the Protection of Children and Adolescents and by international norms and standards.\"The Mission's report confirms that some of the human rights violations documented during this period qualify as crimes against humanity, including persecutions on political grounds.At least 25 people were killed, hundreds were injured, and thousands remain detained for exercising their fundamental right to freedom of expression, the report reveals.The Mission concludes by calling for the immediate release of all individuals arbitrarily detained and urges the Venezuelan government to respect the physical and psychological integrity of detainees. International attention to protect children in these circumstances is also emphasised.The Independent International Fact-Finding Mission will continue to investigate the situation as requested by the Human Rights Council in a recent decision to extend their mandate for another two years.The Mission was established by the Council in September 2019 to assess alleged human rights violations committed in Venezuela since 2014.It consists of three experts who are not UN staff, receive no payment for their work, and do not represent any government or organization.",

    "content": "Harris sees her lead decline after a media blitz full of appearances on TV and podcasts.A week after having a record lead over Donald Trump in a weekly head-to-head poll of likely voters, Vice President Kamala Harris sees her lead shrink with less than one month until the 2024 presidential election.What Happened: Harris has had the lead over Trump in many election polls and until recent weeks saw her election betting odds and prediction market odds top the former president.A new Morning Consult poll of likely voters shows Harris' lead dropping from a record high six points last week. Harris maintains a lead, something she has been able to accomplish most weeks since President Joe Biden dropped out of the election race.The new poll shows the following results from voters, with results from the Oct. 8 poll in parentheses:Kamala Harris: 50% (51%) Donald Trump: 46% (45%) Someone Else: 2% (2%) Don't Know: 2% (2%)The poll also found that 94% of Democrats backed Harris as their top pick, in line with last week's poll. The poll also found 92% of Republicans backed Trump as their top pick, in line with last week's poll.Independent voters selected the following as their head-to-head preference, with the results from the Oct. 8 poll in parentheses:Kamala Harris: 46% (45%) Donald Trump: 42% (44%) Someone Else: 6% (5%) Don't Know: 6% (5%)The vice president also has the edge in the 18-34 age voters demographic, leading 55% to 43%. The 12-point lead is higher than last week's 10-point advantage, but down from a lead of 15 points three weeks ago.Did You Know?Congress Is Making Huge Investments. Get Tips On What They Bought And Sold Ahead Of The 2024 Election With Our Easy-to-Use ToolWhy It's Important: While Harris sees her lead drop from six points to four points, she still maintains an edge over the former president in the national poll of likely voters.The vice president also saw her lead in the key Independent voters and young voters demographics grow from the prior poll. Independent voters remain a key demographic for the 2024 election and Harris has a four-point advantage after last week saw the vice president have a narrow one-point advantage.The newest poll could show that Harris' media blitz that included appearances on the Call Her Daddy podcast, \"60 Minutes,\" \"The Howard Stern Show,\" \"The View\" and taking part in a Town Hall may not have paid off in gaining support from voters.With a gain in Independent and young voters, the media blitz may be working in gaining support from key demographics according the results though.Read Next:Cybersecurity Firm Warns Of Threats To 2024 Presidential Election IntegrityPhoto: ShutterstockMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs",

    "title": "Trump polling better than 2020 and 2016",
    "content": "HUNT VALLEY, Md. (TNND) -- We are now just three weeks away from the 2024 presidential election - and once again, the two candidates are neck-and-neck.According to 538 polling averages, Vice President Kamala Harris has just a little over a two-percentage point lead over former President Donald Trump - 48.5% versus 46.1%.However, trailing in the polls didn't stop Trump in 2016, and he's currently trailing by less of a margin than he was in both the 2016 and 2020 elections.Although polls have their documented issues, and they've been wrong before, the three-week outlook might just be positive for the former president.For context, in 2016, according to the same 538 averaging on Oct. 15, Trump trailed Hillary Clinton by more than five percentage points - 45.3% vs 39.3%.Now, that's national polling. The winner of this election will be determined by the swing states.In all of those except for Georgia, Trump is polling better than he did four and eight years ago. Here's the breakdown, using 538 and RealClear Polling averages:Pollsters argued models underestimated turnout, or that Trump supporters either lied in their survey responses or just refused to fill them out.But, not only is Trump performing better now in the polls than before in the ones that underestimated him, the momentum is decidedly moving in his favor as of late.Harris was riding the wave of momentum both after President Biden dropped out and after her debate with Trump. Now, her popularity is declining in more recent polling.Analysts say it could be because Harris isn't differentiating herself from Biden much, and doesn't represent much of a change from his administration. Plus, voters view Trump's presidency more favorably than Biden's.Still, Trump has to convince voters his rhetoric and behavior won't get in the way of his governing.Whether this election will be like 2016 or 2020 or completely different remains to be seen.",

There's just some question of how her plans could be implemented.Richard Frank, director of the Center on Health Policy at Brookings Institution: Frank says there are two main areas where Harris can improve prescription drug costs. \"The first has to do with clearing out impediments to generic competition,\" he says. \"There are a variety of regulatory and industry strategies that serve to create frictions for generics drugs entering the market. And what that does is it effectively extends the exclusivity period and keeps prices high for prescription drugs that have been on the market for quite a while.\"\"The second part of that, the second competition piece has to do with biosimilars,\" he says. \"And generic drugs apply mostly to what are known as small molecule drugs -- those are drugs that usually come in the form of pills that we've been taking for most of our lives. The other type of drug are biologic products, and they are regulated differently. The Affordable Care Act created a pathway for biosimilars to enter the market and compete that is kind of like what we do for generics, but not exactly. And the regulations have been very slow to develop and they've been what turns out to be excessively cautious. And so what  might do is try to streamline the regulations and to use a sort of pro-competitive policy to try to reinvigorate the biosimilar market and create more competition for biological drugs that have been on the market for quite a while.\"Colleen Grogan, professor and co-director of the Center for Health Administration Studies at the University of Chicago: \"There are now 10 drugs that the federal government is able to negotiate over,\" she says. \"Now it only applies to Medicare, so that impacts the elderly and disabled who who are on Medicare. But Medicare is important because it often sets the stage for private insurance plans to follow and so if Medicare is able to negotiate good prices, then private insurers say, 'Hey, you know, we want those prices, too.' So it often has a broader effect than just Medicare; there is every intention that this is a stepping stone to a broader process of drug price negotiation.\"Grogan adds that it's still an open question whether Republicans in Congress will \nAffordable Care ActHarrisUnder Biden, ACA health care tax credits increased under both the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act. The effect of those tax credits was less expensive plans sold through ACA. Those tax credits are expiring at the end of 2025. Harris has promised to expand and make the credits permanent and there's appetite among Democrats in Congress to do so as well.What the experts sayBivens: \" really boosted enrollment quite a bit and made it a lot more affordable for many people.\" He says that while Harris would extend or make permanent the ACA premium tax credits, Trump is unlikely to do the same.Frank: He says that making ACA tax credits permanent would bring stability to the marketplaces. Frank adds that negotiating the package of ACA subsidies, as well as the expiring Trump tax provisions, will be a major thread in legislative activity next year. \"My guess is there will be some kind of a grand bargain, in part depending on how the election comes out, that creates a sort of revised constellation of those two sets of provisions on taxes and subsidies,\" he says.Grogan: \"Enrollment in the exchanges has gone way up since  and I think I think they would want to continue with that.\"Trump:During Trump's first term, he tried to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, but was unsuccessful. During the debate he said he has only \"concepts\" of a new plan. His running mate, JD Vance, later clarified during an NBC interview that Trump's plan would include deregulating insurance markets to promote competition.Bivens: \"My guess is that it will not be like the same kind of frontal assault on it that there was in 2017, but there will just be a lot of undermining of different provisions of it. I think  is very popular now; in 2017 it was still pretty new and more vulnerable.\"Frank: He says that Trump has no clear alternative plan and he's unsure of the appetite in Congress to take on the messiness and complexities of replacing the ACA.\"I think that the issue is that there are things that can be done to shrink the reach of the Affordable Care Act,\" says Frank. \"And there are things that were done in the last Trump administration to try to make it more difficult to sustain the markets in the Affordable Care Act. But those have largely been restored through various bipartisan legislation over the last few years and those markets are doing quite well. They're insuring more people than they ever have.\"Grogan: She says Trump is unlikely to pursue repealing the ACA and Republicans, in general, know it's not popular. However, she points out that in Project 2025 -- a blueprint for the next Republican president, which was released by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank -- there is a provision that would allow private insurance companies more flexibility around \"essential health benefits.\" She says, \"When you do that, what you're doing is indirectly allowing flexibility on risk rating -- that's not a popular approach.\" She adds that most Americans are happy to move away from preexisting conditions preventing health insurance eligibility or driving up costs of insurance.It's worth noting that Trump has tried to distance himself from Project 2025, but many former Trump administration officials were involved in creating the document.Long-term careHarris:Harris says she would expand Medicare to cover long-term care at home for seniors and those with disabilities who receive Medicare. That includes at-home services like home health aids, personal care attendants or state-certified direct care workers. She would also cover vision and hearing for recipients.She also wants to end the practice in which seniors' homes are seized by states following long-term Medicaid care; the proposal would require action by Congress. Harris also says the expanded benefits would be funded primarily by savings from her proposal to negotiate power with prescription drug companies.Trump:Trump hasn't publicly addressed long-term care, but the 2024 Republican Party platform includes a provision to protect Medicare and ensure seniors receive care without an excessive cost burden. Details are unclear.Bivens: \"The Biden-Harris administration tried to include something pretty big on long-term care in the Build Back Better Act. They had a really big increase on the order of $400 billion over 10 years for home-based health and community-based care services that are paid for through Medicaid, which would have provided a lot of relief for people looking for elder care.\"Health care costs and medical debtHarrisHarris says she's committed to working with states to relieve medical debt. Her package of economic policy proposals points to her work with cities and states to eliminate $7 billion of medical debt for nearly 3 million people.TrumpWhile in office, Trump signed the No Surprises Act to protect people from certain unexpected medical bills. The Republican Party platform for 2024 promises to \"increase transparency, promote choice and competition and expand access to new affordable health care and prescription drug options.\" The details are unclear.What the experts sayBivens: He says medical debt is likely to become a bigger political issue moving forward.\"I think it really is bubbling up from people's lived experiences,\" he says, adding \"I think the details will be a little hard to work out, but I think it's a real pressure point that politicians are going to feel like whoever takes a big swing at solving it will get some real rewards.\"Grogan: She says Harris' promise to eliminate medical debt is a viable one. So far, states have funneled funds from the American Rescue Plan to the local level and, ultimately, to hospitals to relieve medical debt.\"What's interesting to me about that is the subsidies are going to the hospitals because the hospitals are the major way in which people are taking out medical debt, and so that's important that people are getting that relief,\" she says. \"I'm a little bit troubled, to be honest, that it's the hospitals getting the subsidy.\"She says there should be regulations that prevent hospitals who receive subsidies from charging exorbitant prices to individuals. \"I'm worried that we're not taking that approach; we're just sort of throwing more money at the hospitals to behave in ways which I think are problematic.\"Reproductive rightsThe September KFF poll showed that most voters (61%) think that this year's election will have a major impact on abortion access in the U.S. The same portion of voters say they support restoring a nationwide right to abortion.HarrisHarris says she will bring back protections under Roe v. Wade and would ensure there would never be a federal abortion ban. Harris says she'll protect access in vitro fertilization (IVF).TrumpTrump says states should set their own laws.He says he would veto any federal abortion ban. Trump says the government or insurance companies should cover IVF, but many Republicans oppose this idea.What the experts sayBivens: \"I think  stance is pretty incoherent,\" he says. \"It just shows the incredible cross-pressures of a big part of the Republican base who really would like something like a full ban that's incredibly unpopular amongst the electorate at large. It's just a very hard needle to thread.\"Biven says Trump's position on IVF seems \"half-baked\" as he pulls away from the Republican party's more restrictive stance on IVF. He adds, \"If I see a serious plan on this side, I'd be surprised. But for now, I think he just sort of says what he has to say to get out of a rough couple of minutes of a debate or an interview.\"Grogan: She says Harris is limited in what she can do to protect abortion without support in Congress. Same goes for IVF.Grogan says that Trump doesn't have support from some Republicans in Congress to have insurance or the government pay for IVF. As for Trump's stance on abortion, she says \"It's not clear whether he's saying what he wants to say to get elected.\" She points to Project 2025, again, \"There's really, really conservative stances on reproductive rights in that document and he has dissociated himself with that, but the people around him are supporting it.\" She adds, \"I think people have reason to be wary.\"The opioid crisisLittle has been said about the opioid crisis in terms of concrete actions. Here's what we know.HarrisHarris says she would \"stand-up to drug traffickers and pharmaceutical companies, while also working to help those struggling with addiction get the treatment they need,\" according to her packet of economic policy proposals. There are no further details.TrumpTrump has linked the opioid crisis in America to migrants. During the Republican National Convention, he claimed that migrants entering the U.S. illegally have smuggled fentanyl into the U.S., which he claims killed hundreds of thousands of people. Both are incorrect. In 2023, overdose deaths from all opioids, including fentanyl, killed 81,083 people, according to the Center for Disease Control. U.S. Customs and Border Protection says 27,000 pounds of fentanyl were seized in 2023 -- that's the total among 549,000 pounds of all drugs seized in 2023, the majority of which are methamphetamines and marijuana. However, an August 2023 analysis by the libertarian think tank, the Cato Institute, found that the majority of drug smuggling over the border is done by U.S. citizens.What the experts sayFrank: \"I think that we have sort of failed to get people into treatment for these conditions that have grown enormously over the last 30 years,\" he says. \"And I think that, you know, our failure to talk about that has been quite notable.\"Future pandemic preparednessBoth candidates have ignored pandemic preparedness during the campaign. From a public policy perspective, it's an odd choice in the wake of a pandemic. Politically, it's unsurprising that both candidates would want to distance themselves from the last health crisis, let alone suggest the possibility of a future one.What the experts sayBivens: He says there's an obvious reason that neither Trump or Harris has focused much on pandemic preparedness. \"I think it's the collective, 'Let's just hope it never happens again,\" he says.Frank: He says the Biden Administration's budget proposed an increase of money for the CDC to support public health infrastructure, including pandemic preparedness. \"I think more or less where you might expect a Harris administration to go,\" Frank says. \"You haven't heard much explicit from Trump, but if you look at proposals in the Congress through the appropriations process coming from the Republican side of the aisle, you'll see a variety of proposals to cut back pretty significantly on the CDC budget. And so I and I think that, you know, I think that that is something to pay attention to now.\"Grogan: \"When you think about the dangers and the need to really think about preparedness, it's odd,\" she says. \"But on the other hand, I think politically, know that it's such a lightning rod, right? I think both candidates just want to avoid it.\"\nWhat Would Kamala Harris' Opportunity Economy Look Like?What Would the Trump Economy Look Like?How Harris and Trump Want to Battle Inflation and Lower PricesThe article How Trump and Harris Aim to Address Your Health Care originally appeared on NerdWallet.",

Democrats are more likely (78%) than Republicans (53%) to say health care hasn't received enough attention.That response is likely because the candidates have been light on the details when it comes to most topics concerning health care in America:Harris has focused on lowering prescription drug prices; expanding Medicare coverage for long-term care; working with states to cancel medical debt; and supporting the restoration of federal abortion rights. Trump says he supports IVF coverage, but abortion should be left to the states. And during the Sept. 10 debate he said that he has only a \"concept\" of a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act.Both candidates promise to protect Medicare.According to a September poll by Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), the health care-related issues that voters most care about include abortion (7%); Medicare and Social Security (7%) and health care costs, including prescription drug costs (5%).Most of the candidates' proposals would only move forward with support from Congress. NerdWallet spoke with three health care policy experts to get their take on what Trump and Harris have in store for health care.Prescription drugsHarrisHarris has said she wants to lower prescription drug prices. Under 2022's Inflation Reduction Act, a provision allows Medicare to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. It also added a $2,000 cap on all out-of-pocket drug expenses. In addition, the Biden-Harris administration capped insulin at $35 for seniors. Harris wants to extend these cost-saving measures to all Americans. She also wants to expedite Medicare prescription drug negotiations. And she proposed to \"increase competition and demand transparency in the health care industry,\" according to her packet of economic policy proposals. The details on this are unclear.TrumpIn 2016, Trump campaigned on reducing drug prices. During his time in office, he supported several measures including capping insulin costs for certain Medicare recipients, and issued an executive order to make it easier to import inexpensive prescription drugs.

Frank adds that negotiating the package of ACA subsidies, as well as the expiring Trump tax provisions, will be a major thread in legislative activity next year. \"My guess is there will be some kind of a grand bargain, in part depending on how the election comes out, that creates a sort of revised constellation of those two sets of provisions on taxes and subsidies,\" he says.Grogan: \"Enrollment in the exchanges has gone way up since  and I think I think they would want to continue with that.\"Trump:During Trump's first term, he tried to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, but was unsuccessful. During the debate he said he has only \"concepts\" of a new plan. His running mate, JD Vance, later clarified during an NBC interview that Trump's plan would include deregulating insurance markets to promote competition.Bivens: \"My guess is that it will not be like the same kind of frontal assault on it that there was in 2017, but there will just be a lot of undermining of different provisions of it. I think  is very popular now; in 2017 it was still pretty new and more vulnerable.\"Frank: He says that Trump has no clear alternative plan and he's unsure of the appetite in Congress to take on the messiness and complexities of replacing the ACA.\"I think that the issue is that there are things that can be done to shrink the reach of the Affordable Care Act,\" says Frank. \"And there are things that were done in the last Trump administration to try to make it more difficult to sustain the markets in the Affordable Care Act. But those have largely been restored through various bipartisan legislation over the last few years and those markets are doing quite well. They're insuring more people than they ever have.\"Grogan: She says Trump is unlikely to pursue repealing the ACA and Republicans, in general, know it's not popular. However, she points out that in Project 2025 -- a blueprint for the next Republican president, which was released by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank -- there is a provision that would allow private insurance companies more flexibility around \"essential health benefits.\" She says, \"When you do that, what you're doing is indirectly allowing flexibility on risk rating -- that's not a popular approach.\" She adds that most Americans are happy to move away from preexisting conditions preventing health insurance eligibility or driving up costs of insurance.It's worth noting that Trump has tried to distance himself from Project 2025, but many former Trump administration officials were involved in creating the document.Long-term careHarris:Harris says she would expand Medicare to cover long-term care at home for seniors and those with disabilities who receive Medicare. That includes at-home services like home health aids, personal care attendants or state-certified direct care workers. She would also cover vision and hearing for recipients.She also wants to end the practice in which seniors' homes are seized by states following long-term Medicaid care; the proposal would require action by Congress. Harris also says the expanded benefits would be funded primarily by savings from her proposal to negotiate power with prescription drug companies.Trump:Trump hasn't publicly addressed long-term care, but the 2024 Republican Party platform includes a provision to protect Medicare and ensure seniors receive care without an excessive cost burden. Details are unclear.Bivens: \"The Biden-Harris administration tried to include something pretty big on long-term care in the Build Back Better Act. They had a really big increase on the order of $400 billion over 10 years for home-based health and community-based care services that are paid for through Medicaid, which would have provided a lot of relief for people looking for elder care.\"Health care costs and medical debtHarrisHarris says she's committed to working with states to relieve medical debt. Her package of economic policy proposals points to her work with cities and states to eliminate $7 billion of medical debt for nearly 3 million people.TrumpWhile in office, Trump signed the No Surprises Act to protect people from certain unexpected medical bills. The Republican Party platform for 2024 promises to \"increase transparency, promote choice and competition and expand access to new affordable health care and prescription drug options.\" The details are unclear.What the experts sayBivens: He says medical debt is likely to become a bigger political issue moving forward.\"I think it really is bubbling up from people's lived experiences,\" he says, adding \"I think the details will be a little hard to work out, but I think it's a real pressure point that politicians are going to feel like whoever takes a big swing at solving it will get some real rewards.\"Grogan: She says Harris' promise to eliminate medical debt is a viable one. So far, states have funneled funds from the American Rescue Plan to the local level and, ultimately, to hospitals to relieve medical debt.\"What's interesting to me about that is the subsidies are going to the hospitals because the hospitals are the major way in which people are taking out medical debt, and so that's important that people are getting that relief,\" she says. \"I'm a little bit troubled, to be honest, that it's the hospitals getting the subsidy.\"She says there should be regulations that prevent hospitals who receive subsidies from charging exorbitant prices to individuals. \"I'm worried that we're not taking that approach; we're just sort of throwing more money at the hospitals to behave in ways which I think are problematic.\"Reproductive rightsThe September KFF poll showed that most voters (61%) think that this year's election will have a major impact on abortion access in the U.S. The same portion of voters say they support restoring a nationwide right to abortion.HarrisHarris says she will bring back protections under Roe v. Wade and would ensure there would never be a federal abortion ban. Harris says she'll protect access in vitro fertilization (IVF).TrumpTrump says states should set their own laws.He says he would veto any federal abortion ban. Trump says the government or insurance companies should cover IVF, but many Republicans oppose this idea.What the experts sayBivens: \"I think  stance is pretty incoherent,\" he says. \"It just shows the incredible cross-pressures of a big part of the Republican base who really would like something like a full ban that's incredibly unpopular amongst the electorate at large. It's just a very hard needle to thread.\"Biven says Trump's position on IVF seems \"half-baked\" as he pulls away from the Republican party's more restrictive stance on IVF. He adds, \"If I see a serious plan on this side, I'd be surprised. But for now, I think he just sort of says what he has to say to get out of a rough couple of minutes of a debate or an interview.\"Grogan: She says Harris is limited in what she can do to protect abortion without support in Congress. Same goes for IVF.Grogan says that Trump doesn't have support from some Republicans in Congress to have insurance or the government pay for IVF. As for Trump's stance on abortion, she says \"It's not clear whether he's saying what he wants to say to get elected.\" She points to Project 2025, again, \"There's really, really conservative stances on reproductive rights in that document and he has dissociated himself with that, but the people around him are supporting it.\" She adds, \"I think people have reason to be wary.\"The opioid crisisLittle has been said about the opioid crisis in terms of concrete actions. Here's what we know.HarrisHarris says she would \"stand-up to drug traffickers and pharmaceutical companies, while also working to help those struggling with addiction get the treatment they need,\" according to her packet of economic policy proposals. There are no further details.TrumpTrump has linked the opioid crisis in America to migrants. During the Republican National Convention, he claimed that migrants entering the U.S. illegally have smuggled fentanyl into the U.S., which he claims killed hundreds of thousands of people. Both are incorrect. In 2023, overdose deaths from all opioids, including fentanyl, killed 81,083 people, according to the Center for Disease Control. U.S. Customs and Border Protection says 27,000 pounds of fentanyl were seized in 2023 -- that's the total among 549,000 pounds of all drugs seized in 2023, the majority of which are methamphetamines and marijuana. However, an August 2023 analysis by the libertarian think tank, the Cato Institute, found that the majority of drug smuggling over the border is done by U.S. citizens.What the experts sayFrank: \"I think that we have sort of failed to get people into treatment for these conditions that have grown enormously over the last 30 years,\" he says. \"And I think that, you know, our failure to talk about that has been quite notable.\"Future pandemic preparednessBoth candidates have ignored pandemic preparedness during the campaign. From a public policy perspective, it's an odd choice in the wake of a pandemic. Politically, it's unsurprising that both candidates would want to distance themselves from the last health crisis, let alone suggest the possibility of a future one.What the experts sayBivens: He says there's an obvious reason that neither Trump or Harris has focused much on pandemic preparedness. \"I think it's the collective, 'Let's just hope it never happens again,\" he says.Frank: He says the Biden Administration's budget proposed an increase of money for the CDC to support public health infrastructure, including pandemic preparedness. \"I think more or less where you might expect a Harris administration to go,\" Frank says. \"You haven't heard much explicit from Trump, but if you look at proposals in the Congress through the appropriations process coming from the Republican side of the aisle, you'll see a variety of proposals to cut back pretty significantly on the CDC budget. And so I and I think that, you know, I think that that is something to pay attention to now.\"Grogan: \"When you think about the dangers and the need to really think about preparedness, it's odd,\" she says. \"But on the other hand, I think politically, know that it's such a lightning rod, right? I think both candidates just want to avoid it.\"\nAnna Helhoski writes for NerdWallet. Email: anna@nerdwallet.com.

    "content": "Feeling angry this election season? These physical and mental strategies can help you cool off.Elena CoxOctober 15, 2024 at 10:30 PMThe high-stakes presidential race is leading to heightened emotions, and no matter the results, millions of Americans will be disappointed in November.According to late September national polling data, Republican nominee Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are essentially tied, though Trump has an edge in key battleground states.A September 2024 poll of registered voters from Pew Research showed that 7 in 10 Harris supporters say that Trump makes them feel \"very\" or \"extremely angry,\" while 6 in 10 Trump supporters say the same about Harris.These strong feelings about the two major-party candidates can bleed over into interpersonal relationships. A separate poll from Yahoo News about the 2024 presidential election found that about one-quarter of Democrats and Republicans have had a friendship or family relationship end over differing political beliefs. Meanwhile, nearly a third of Americans say they find it stressful to spend time with people who don't share their views.This can lead to some awkward Thanksgiving dinner conversations. But while venting to a like-minded cousin or sweating it out with a run around the block can feel good in the moment, a 2024 study in the journal Clinical Psychology Review found that decreasing arousal is the best way to regulate anger.Counseling Schools examined peer-reviewed research and other sources to explain what anger does to the body and compile tips for staying grounded when discussing heated topics such as politics with loved ones.Anger can take a physical toll by restricting blood flow and producing stress hormones, which can have short- and long-term effects on the body, particularly the heart.After an angry outburst, people are five times more likely to experience a heart attack, according to research published in the European Heart Journal. A 2024 study published this year in the Journal of the American Heart Association found anger impacts the ability to relax blood vessels, which can lead to cardiovascular disease.Anger also activates the amygdala, the part of the brain that initiates the \"fight-or-flight\" response. Stress can make it difficult to regulate emotions and impair the brain's ability to think and respond clearly.The good news is, according to the Yahoo poll, the majority of members of both parties say personal relationships are more important than politics. So next time you feel your blood boiling when discussing a heated topic like abortion or gun control, here are some scientifically proven strategies to help cool off.Take a deep breathBreath work has long been a part of Eastern medicine, including yoga and meditation. Scientific research shows it can reduce stress levels by reducing one's heart rate, increasing blood oxygen levels, and activating the parasympathetic nervous system, or the \"rest and digest\" part of the brain.There are different types of breathing exercises, but all of them involve being intentional and focusing on sensations in the body.Diaphragmatic breathing, or belly breathing, involves taking a deep breath in through the nose and allowing the stomach to expand before slowly exhaling through the mouth. Strategies like counting breaths and box breathing can reduce anger by shifting focus to the present moment. Start by breathing in for four seconds, holding for four seconds, and then exhaling for four seconds. Repeat until you feel more relaxed.Try nonstrenuous exerciseYoga, which typically involves breath work, is another way to reduce anger. It helps release tension in the body and get out of fight-or-flight mode. Positions such as the wide-legged child's pose can help you feel grounded, while a standing forward fold can help lower blood pressure.If yoga isn't a good fit for you, try some light stretching or going for a walk. Walking, especially in nature, has been shown to decrease activity in the amygdala, where the brain processes emotions and regulates fear and anxiety.Think logically and anticipate difficult situationsA 2023 study in the journal Psychological Reports found that even anticipating election-related stress can have an adverse effect on a person's physical and mental health.Research suggests that before entering a potentially stressful situation, it's important to think critically about what could come up and how to respond. This could help avoid uncomfortable topics altogether or at least formulate some prepared responses to prevent the conversation from getting too heated.Another way to manage emotions is to look at things through a neutral lens. Begin by identifying the feeling -- in this case, anger -- and exploring the underlying cause. Asking yourself questions like \"Why is this issue important to me?\" or \"What is at stake?\" can help reframe the situation and identify the source of negative emotions. Once you get to the root thought, evaluate its accuracy before deciding how to respond.Practice active listeningWhen someone expresses anger toward you, it can be easy to get defensive and fight back. Learning to defuse the situation can be an invaluable skill for maintaining relationships.Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley suggest first considering what the angry person needs. If they want to let off steam and vent about something that's been bothering them, try to listen without judgment. If they want to be heard or understood, acknowledge their feelings and try to use empathy to see where they're coming from.In any case, remain calm and use body language and words of affirmation to show you are listening. While it may be difficult, try not to take things personally, and remember that people tend to become less angry after expressing their feelings.Use humorAnother way to lower the stakes of a tense situation is to add levity. Humor can put things in perspective and reduce tension. A 2023 review in the journal PLoS One found spontaneous laughter can effectively lower cortisol or stress hormones.However, this can backfire if a joke is taken the wrong way. Be sure you know your audience before using this tactic, and consider poking fun at yourself to avoid hurting someone's feelings and making the situation worse.When all else fails, removing yourself from a contentious situation can be the best way to prevent saying something you'll regret.It may be tempting to stand your ground and convince someone why your belief or preferred candidate is the right one. But first, weigh the consequences and decide whether being right is worth costing you a relationship with someone you care about.Story editing by Alizah Salario and Kelly Glass.

    "title": "Trump Vs. Harris: 2024 Election Polls, Sportsbooks Betting Odds Show Different Winners For 2024 Election - USData (OTC:USDC)",
    "content": "The two election prediction methods differ in naming a winner for the 2024 election.The head-to-head matchup between Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump remains close in election polls and betting odds with less than one month until the 2024 election day.The two methods of predicting the winner of the 2024 presidential election appear to differ on who will be sworn in on inauguration day in January 2025.What Happened: Election polls show a close race between Trump and Harris, with the current vice president getting the edge in most national polls of registered polls.While some swing state polls point to Trump winning the key battleground states, most national polls show Harris with a strong chance of winning the 2024 election.After Harris led betting odds and prediction markets for some time, both of these key indicators have shifted to favoring Trump as the winner of the 2024 election, which could put election polls and betting odds in different camps when it comes to predicting a winner.The betting odds at Bet365 show Trump as the favorite to return to the White House, as reported by Covers.Trump is listed as the favorite at -150, implying a 60% chance of winning the election and Harris listed at +120 as the underdog with an implied chance of 45.6% to win the election.The betting odds differ from less than a month ago when Harris was listed as the favorite with odds of -125 and Trump was listed as the underdog at +120.For comparison, Trump was the favorite at odds of -125 and Harris was listed at +100 back in August.Polymarket, which calls itself the world's largest prediction market, offers betting on items in categories such as politics, sports, cryptocurrency, pop culture and more.The Polymarket 2024 election outcome winner market has over $1.9 billion in wagers placed and continues to be one of the most popular markets. The current odds show Trump with a 57.9% chance of winning and Harris with a 41.9% chance of winning.This differs significantly from weeks ago when Harris was the favorite at 51% and Trump had less than 50%.On Polymarket, users can deposit funds using USDC USDC/USD via the Polygon MATIC/USD network, or directly from a crypto account with Ethereum ETH/USD. In each betting market, the winning option pays out at $1.Did You Know?Congress Is Making Huge Investments. Get Tips On What They Bought And Sold Ahead Of The 2024 Election With Our Easy-to-Use ToolWhy It's Important: Trump has mostly been in the lead on Polymarket, with Harris remaining close and sometimes taking the lead. Trump held a lead of eight points ahead of the September presidential debate before the two candidates ended up tied after the debate and shortly after.Harris has seen her odds on the prediction market drop significantly in recent weeks, while Trump's odds to win have come roaring back.The betting odds and prediction markets have often fluctuated with key political events and assassination attempts on Trump often impacting the markets.An assassination attempt on Trump in Pennsylvania led to the former president becoming a huge favorite at -250 with then presidential candidate President Joe Biden at +500 and Harris at +800.Following the first presidential debate, Trump had odds of -175, with Harris at +400 topping the odds of Biden at +800 before his withdrawal from the race.In late June, Trump was listed with odds of -188 with Biden at +350 and Harris significantly behind at +2,200.Keep in mind that back in January 2021, it was Harris who was the favorite to win the 2024 election with odds of +350 based on the plan that Biden would not run for re-election. Biden and Trump trailed Harris at the time at odds of +400 and +650, respectively.Most election polls point to seven key swing states that could decide the outcome of the 2024 election. Betting odds for six of the swing states are listed on Bet365, as reported by Covers and are listed below:Arizona: Harris +220, Trump -275 Georgia: Harris +162, Trump -200 Michigan: Harris -125, Trump +100 North Carolina: Harris +150, Trump -188 Pennsylvania: Harris +100, Trump -120 Wisconsin: Harris -125, Trump +100The betting odds imply that Trump would win five of the seven states taking a total of 62 electoral college votes represented by the six states above. Harris would win two states and secure 25 of the 87 electoral college votes.The election polls and betting odds may differ, but both still show a close race expected between Trump and Harris.Read Next:Trump Vs.

    "title": "National Border Patrol Council endorses Donald Trump, says only he can solve the BORDER CRISIS - Russia News Now",
    "content": "The National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) has officially and unanimously endorsed former president Donald Trump for the upcoming presidential election in November.The NBPC is the main labor union representing agents and support staff of the United States Border Patrol. During a campaign rally in Prescott Valley, Arizona, on Oct. 12, NBPC President Paul Perez joined Trump on stage to officially announce the union's support for the Republican presidential nominee.\"America, I have a message for you. If we allow border czar  Harris to win this election, every city, every community in this great country is going to go to hell,\" Perez said. \"The untold millions of people unvetted, who she has allowed into this country that are committing murders, rapes, robberies, burglaries and every other crime will continue to put our country in peril.\"\"Only one man can fix that. That is Donald J. Trump. He has always stood with the men and women who protect this border, who put their lives on the line for the country,\" he continued. \"On behalf of the 16,000 men and women represented by the National Border Patrol Council, we strongly support and endorse Donald J. Trump for President of the United States.\"Perez noted that their choices could either continue the border chaos or put an end to it. (Related: United Auto Workers president says \"a great majority\" of union members WON'T VOTE for Biden despite official endorsement.)As a response, Trump thanked the NBPC for its endorsement on his official account on X. \"Thank you to the 16,000 Border Patrol Officers for your COMPLETE ENDORSEMENT and SUPPORT!\" he posted, along with the video clip of Perez' official statement.The NBPC endorsement validated the result of a recent Rasmussen poll that voters trust Trump more than Harris on immigration policy and border security.According to the poll, conducted from Sept. 15 to 17 among 987 likely voters, 51 percent of respondents trust Trump over Harris on immigration policy and border security, compared to the 43 percent who favor Harris over Trump.The result also revealed the importance of immigration among these likely voters for the upcoming election. For instance, 75 percent of respondents say immigration will be an important factor in casting their votes in November. Meanwhile, 51 percent believe immigration policy will be \"very important\" in casting their votes compared to the 23 percent who believe it is less important. Among those who believe immigration is \"very important,\" 80 percent trust Trump over Harris in handling the issue.Along party lines, 77 percent of Democrats back Harris on immigration compared to the 84 percent of Republicans who trust Trump. Independents also trust Trump more than Harris, with 53 percent backing him and 39 percent supporting Harris. Additionally, the results found that 33 percent of Democrats, 71 percent of Republicans and 50 percent of independents believe immigration policy is an important election issue.Moreover, 78 percent of white voters, 71 percent of Black voters, 71 percent of Hispanic voters and 69 percent of non-Black minorities believe immigration and border security are important factors that would influence their vote in November. The issue also reflects among voters across income levels, with higher-income earners generally leaning toward Harris, while those earning between $50,000 and $100,000 favor Trump.Head over to Trump.news for more stories about the former president ahead of the 2024 presidential election.Watch Robert F.

    "title": "Trump polling better than 2020 and 2016",
    "content": "HUNT VALLEY, Md. (TNND) -- We are now just three weeks away from the 2024 presidential election - and once again, the two candidates are neck-and-neck.According to 538 polling averages, Vice President Kamala Harris has just a little over a two-percentage point lead over former President Donald Trump - 48.5% versus 46.1%.However, trailing in the polls didn't stop Trump in 2016, and he's currently trailing by less of a margin than he was in both the 2016 and 2020 elections.Although polls have their documented issues, and they've been wrong before, the three-week outlook might just be positive for the former president.For context, in 2016, according to the same 538 averaging on Oct. 15, Trump trailed Hillary Clinton by more than five percentage points - 45.3% vs 39.3%.In 2020 on Oct. 15, Trump trailed President Joe Biden by nearly ten percentage points - 52.4% versus 41.9%.Now, that's national polling. The winner of this election will be determined by the swing states.In all of those except for Georgia, Trump is polling better than he did four and eight years ago. Here's the breakdown, using 538 and RealClear Polling averages:Pollsters argued models underestimated turnout, or that Trump supporters either lied in their survey responses or just refused to fill them out.But, not only is Trump performing better now in the polls than before in the ones that underestimated him, the momentum is decidedly moving in his favor as of late.Harris was riding the wave of momentum both after President Biden dropped out and after her debate with Trump. Now, her popularity is declining in more recent polling.Analysts say it could be because Harris isn't differentiating herself from Biden much, and doesn't represent much of a change from his administration. Plus, voters view Trump's presidency more favorably than Biden's.Still, Trump has to convince voters his rhetoric and behavior won't get in the way of his governing.Whether this election will be like 2016 or 2020 or completely different remains to be seen.",

    "title": "Fact Check Team: Trump seen as better economic manager over Harris by 54% of voters",
    "content": "WASHINGTON (TNND) -- The economy is the top area of concern for voters in the 2024 Presidential Election, according to a new poll from Gallup.It's actually the only major issue that the majority of voters, 52% to be exact, say whatever Trump or Harris' stance is on the economy has \"extremely important\" sway on how they're going to vote. According to Gallup, another 38% of voters rated the economy as \"very important,\" meaning this issue could be a deal breaker for around 90% of voters.This Gallup poll was conducted from September 16-28 and found voters haven't felt this strongly about the economy in a presidential election since 2008.About 54% of voters said they viewed Donald Trump as a better option when it comes to managing the economy as opposed to the 45% that chose Kamala Harris. It's important to note, that these feelings among voters have shifted a bit towards Trump within the last couple of weeks. The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research did a poll in September and found around 43% of voters trust Trump and 41% trust Harris.Both candidates have been discussing the economy on the campaign trail for months and both seem to have very different strategies when it comes to tackling the issue of the economy.Trump's plan focuses on revitalizing U.S. manufacturing by lowering the corporate tax rate to 15% for domestic producers, putting tariffs in place on imported goods, and creating special manufacturing zones with reduced taxes and regulations. He's also big on getting rid of what he calls unnecessary environmental regulations and aims to bring jobs and factories back from overseas.According to Trump's 2024 GOP PLATFORM:Our America first economic agenda rests on five pillars: slashing regulations, cutting taxes, securing fair trade deals, ensuring reliable and abundant low cost energy, and championing innovation. together, we will restore economic prosperity and opportunity for all Americans.As for Harris, she plans on prioritizing small businesses and wants to give them a fifty thousand dollar tax cut, she also wants to lower grocery and prescription drug prices by instituting a national price gouging ban. Harris said she aims to expand the child tax credit and give forgivable loans to black entrepreneurs, along with other things.According to Harris' Plan to Lower Costs and Create an Opportunity Economy:They know that prices are still too high for middle-class families, which is why their top economic priorities will be lowering the costs of everyday needs like health care, housing and groceries and cutting taxes for more than 100 million working and middle-class Americans.",

Proponents say this is so officials can be confident in the accuracy of results -- but critics allege the rule would give partisan election board members the ability to stall results.In September, the Georgia State Election Board also passed a rule that requires counties to hand-count all ballots.

    "content": "According to the survey, approximately 41.6 percent of U.S. homeowners believe that Donald Trump is best suited to maintain high home values, while 35.3 percent favor Kamala Harris for this role. Although homeowners generally see high home values as beneficial since much of their wealth is tied to home equity, one-third of Americans do not own.Whether it's refining your business model, mastering new technologies, or discovering strategies to capitalize on the next market surge, Inman Connect New York will prepare you to take bold steps forward. The Next Chapter is about to begin. Be part of it. Join us and thousands of real estate leaders Jan. 22-24, 2025.As the 2024 presidential election approaches, a Redfin-commissioned survey conducted by Ipsos last month reveals notable differences in priorities between homeowners and renters regarding candidates and key issues affecting housing.The survey, focused on 805 homeowners out of 1,802 respondents aged 18-65, asked participants: Regardless of who you plan on voting for, which candidate do you think will be best for keeping home values high?According to the survey, approximately 41.6 percent of U.S. homeowners believe that Donald Trump is best suited to maintain high home values, while 35.3 percent favor Kamala Harris for this role.Although homeowners generally see high home values as beneficial since much of their wealth is tied to home equity, one-third of Americans do not own their homes. Approximately 49 percent of renters surveyed believe Kamala Harris would be better for housing affordability, compared to 31 percent for Donald Trump.Additionally, 30 percent of renters listed housing affordability as a top-three issue influencing their presidential choice, compared to only 17 percent of homeowners. Homeowners were more likely to cite the economy as a top concern.A separate part of the survey asked a group of 804 U.S. homeowners and 894 U.S. renters to rank a list of 14 issues to determine: \"How important will each of these issues be in your choice of which candidate to support.\" The survey's findings highlight that the economy is the leading issue overall, with 46 percent of respondents ranking it as a top concern, followed by inflation (40.4 percent), health care (26.3 percent), housing affordability (25.1 percent), and crime and safety (23.5 percent).The pandemic influenced homeownership patterns; while many achieved homeownership due to low mortgage rates, others were priced out as housing prices soared. According to Redfin Chief Economist Daryl Fairweather, high mortgage rates are further complicating affordability for first-time buyers, prompting renters to prioritize housing affordability this election cycle. Although starter-home prices are down from last year, they remain above pre-pandemic levels.This growing concern is reflected in buyer behavior, with 23 percent of prospective first-time buyers indicating they are waiting until after the election to see whether Harris' housing affordability plan or Trump's proposed policies will be enacted before making their purchase, according to a Redfin report.Financially, 52.1 percent of homeowners reported feeling better off than four years ago, compared to 44.2 percent of renters. This disparity is largely attributed to rising housing prices, which have helped homeowners build significant equity.Among voters, those supporting Kamala Harris are slightly more likely to prioritize housing affordability, with 25.1 percent ranking it as a top issue compared to 20.4 percent of Trump supporters. This trend may reflect the fact that Democrats tend to reside in more expensive coastal and urban areas.A report from Realtor.com also explores the impact of migration on the 2024 presidential election. Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, notes that shifting populations could reshape voting habits, particularly in swing states where even minor changes in demographics can influence outcomes.\"The influence of migration on election outcomes is a compelling topic of discussion, sparking interest in how shifting populations might reshape the political landscape, \" said Hale. \"As more people move across state lines, their voting habits could have the potential to sway election outcomes, especially in crucial swing states, where even small changes in the electorate can tip the scales. This dynamic raises important questions about how migration trends could influence the future of American politics this year and beyond.\"Key findings on migration include potential trends for various states in the upcoming election:New Jersey shows the largest difference favoring blue shoppers, while Tennessee is the top choice for red buyers. Florida, Texas and North Carolina are among the leading destinations for both blue and red homeshoppers, likely due to their relatively affordable housing markets and favorable climates.As voters prepare for the upcoming election, the relationship between housing trends and political preferences continues to evolve. With significant attention on housing affordability, opinions on candidate housing policy could significantly impact voter turnout and decision-making in the 2024 presidential election.",

Boy, excuse the pun, but what a rockstar she is coming here and creating more jobs,\" he added.New data released by Destination Toronto reveals that Swift's concerts in Toronto throughout November could bring as much as $282 million in economic impact to the city. The tour, which is coming to Toronto on Nov. 14, 15, 16, 21, 22, and 23, is the highest-grossing tour of all time and the first in history to surpass US$1 billion in revenue.Despite this, Ford reportedly told the media that Swift \"should stick with music, and let the other folks stick with what they do best.\" After being posted to X, the quote was met with anger by Ontario residents and Swifties across the country, who called the premier's comments \"misogynistic.\"Still, when asked if he's planning to attend any of Swift's Toronto shows, Ford replied, \"We'll see,\" with a smile.Leader of the Ontario NDP and Opposition, Marit Stiles, also got involved in the conversation and urged the Premier to go back to his \"sticker business.\"Others thought the comments didn't come as a surprise, and referenced a CityNews video from 2016 when Ford spoke highly about Republican US presidential candidate Donald Trump and called his support for the controversial figure \"unwavering.\"In September, Swift endorsed Harris for the upcoming presidential election, calling her a \"steady-handed, gifted leader,\" and supported her decision to select Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate, who, she wrote, has been \"standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman's right to her own body for decades.\"Following Swift's endorsement, roughly 400,000 people clicked through from her Instagram account to a federal voting information site in 24 hours.",

When the fight over Florida's electoral votes arrived at the US Supreme Court in 2000, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in a dissenting opinion that \"the court was wrong to take this case\" and risked \"a self-inflicted wound - a wound that may harm not just the court, but the nation.\"Two decades later, the logistical obstacles to voting presented by the pandemic sparked a flurry of pre- and post-election litigation. Republicans opposed the sudden expansion of absentee voting options; Democrats supported it. The chaotic voting landscape fueled Trump's efforts to use courts to overturn the results.Well ahead of this year's matchup, the Republican National Committee launched what it described as a comprehensive and \"unprecedented legal strategy\" to challenge state and local governments that they say have failed to do enough to protect against illegal voting. The Democratic Party and its allies haven't been idle, contesting laws that they say keep eligible voters from the polls or put up barriers to voting.The court action has been concentrated in the seven states critical for an electoral college victory: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.To understand the rapidly changing political-legal tactics, Bloomberg News analyzed cases with the potential to affect voting procedures and ballot counting in the November presidential contest.Outcomes have been mixed. The RNC lost fights over late-arriving absentee ballots in Nevada and Mississippi and the use of drop boxes in Wisconsin, but won an order limiting voter ID options for North Carolina college students. The DNC joined an unsuccessful push to get undated mail ballots counted in Pennsylvania but backed Wisconsin's successful defense of its rules for absentee ballots requested online.For the GOP, each favorable ruling \"is an incremental step towards election integrity,\" said Steve Roberts, a partner at the law firm Holtzman Vogel, which represents Republicans in election fights. Voting rights advocates call such claims spurious - \"pure speculation\" and \"a messaging tool,\" said Sophia Lin Lakin, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Voting Rights Project.Election officials across the political spectrum strenuously dispute allegations of pervasive problems with voting apparatuses at the state and local level. They say that baseless claims of mismanagement and voter fraud - which researchers have found is rare - are the bigger blow to the integrity of elections.Of the cases tracked by Bloomberg, nearly one-third focus on who should be allowed to vote. The majority have been brought by Republicans or conservative groups seeking to limit access to the polls, chiefly by accusing states of failing to purge their rolls of ineligible voters.States have hit back, accusing the challengers of cherry-picking data and casting aspersions on common and lawful voter roll maintenance practices. Many of these cases have been filed since July and are unlikely to wrap up by November - fueling criticism that they're primarily aimed at sowing mistrust, not securing tangible outcomes.Democrats and left-leaning groups have focused their efforts on expanding, or ensuring, access to the polls. Civil rights groups led by the Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice sued to block a directive from Alabama's Republican Secretary of State Wes Allen to bar from voting more than 3,000 residents listed in a federal database of foreign nationals.Allen has acknowledged that some of those people may have become citizens and therefore eligible to vote, others may have been listed by mistake; either way, they'd have to prove it. The suit says the broad purge violates voter protections and the US Constitution and is in league with a \"nationwide, bad-faith effort\" to boost the false idea that non-citizens are voting in large numbers.The US Department of Justice also sued Alabama. A federal judge hasn't ruled yet whether the 3,000 can remain eligible to vote while the cases proceed.Other eligibility cases have involved whether people with past felony convictions are allowed to vote and how states and counties handle challenges by outside third parties to the validity of voter registrations.The Covid pandemic inspired a record 43% of American voters to cast an absentee ballot in 2020. While that fell in the 2022 midterms, it was still well above historic levels.The new enthusiasm for remote voting continues to inspire lawsuits. The current fight over Wisconsin's use of ballot drop boxes resurfaced claims Republicans have been making since 2020, that the practice heightens the risk of fraud. State officials defend it as a secure, time-tested way to encourage voter participation.In 2022, the Wisconsin Supreme Court barred the use of drop boxes; in July, a new and more liberal slate of justices reversed the earlierban.Of all the cases identified by Bloomberg since January 2023, more than a third were filed in August and September, suggesting a rush for resolution - or at least the public's attention - in the final weeks of the campaign.In North Carolina, the RNC sued on Sept. 12 to block students and employees from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from showing their school-issued digital ID cards as proof of identity at the polls. A judge rejected the party's request on Sept. 20. But a week later, an appeals court reversed and said the digital cards couldn't be used.Judges are aware that last-minute decisions risk confusion among voters and could interfere with the administration of the election. There isn't a hard and fast rule for precisely how close to an election is , leaving officials in limbo until cases finish moving through the legal system.Election officials stress that no presidential contest is officially decided in the hours after polls close, no matter what news outlets say. More than half of all states accept at least some absentee ballots that arrive after Nov. 5. It's a practice that Republicans have gone to court to protest; appeals are pending after the GOP lost fights in Nevada and .Other cases grapple with what happens when voters make mistakes on their ballots. Pennsylvania in particular, with its and 19 electoral college votes, has become a hotbed for these types of fights.The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania rebuffed several challenges to a state law that invalidates undated or misdated mail ballots, even if they arrive on time. Voting rights groups, with support from the DNC, say the rule has led to thousands of rejected votes in past cycles.The state's high court also rejected a case brought by the RNC seeking to block counties from notifying voters about problems with their mail ballots and giving them an opportunity to fix them.In 2020, people who voted for President Joe Biden were almost twice as likely to say they mailed in their ballots compared with Trump supporters, according to a Pew Research Center study.A small but critical subset of cases involves the duty of local election officials to certify vote tallies - historically an uncontroversial, routine function with little room for independent action. The 2020 election changed that, as Trump's supporters in swing states explored options to delay or block his loss from being certified by states and Congress.This election is the first major test of 2022 congressional legislation that established new deadlines and other processes for states to certify results in presidential contests. Deliberate, partisan foot-dragging could throw the enterprise into uncharted territory - and into court.In the spring, Julie Adams, a Republican member of the Fulton County, Georgia, election board, refused to certify the results of the presidential primary. Ultimately, her reservations were overruled by other members of the election board, but she sued to preemptively protect the ability of county officials to deny certification in November.A judge ruled against Adams on Oct. 15, writing that officials in her position must certify results. \"Georgia voters would be silenced,\" he wrote, if election officers were \"free to play investigator, prosecutor, jury and judge.\"Democrats - concerned about a repeat scenario in the battleground state - are asking the same judge to block new rules adopted by the Republican-majority state election board that require election officials like Adams to conduct a \"reasonable inquiry\" before they certify. The DNC is also suing over the state board's decision to require a hand count of ballots.Until vote counts come in, it's impossible to know which issues in which states will trigger legal fights after Nov. 5. Ideally courts will dispatch as many cases as possible ahead of election day, says Rebecca Green, co-director of the Election Law Program at William & Mary Law School.That's the best chance to allow judges - some of whom are elected partisans or federal jurists whose presidential appointment will inevitably be scrutinized - to retain the high ground, she said: \"You're resolving these questions at least behind a veil of ignorance about who will benefit.\"© 2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

I can't think of anything more hypocritical,\" Stan told The Hollywood Reporter at the BFI London Film Festival.In typical Trump form, the presidential hopeful hasn't minced words when it comes to his feelings around the Ali Abbasi-directed film. He called it \"FAKE\" and \"CLASSLESS\" in a Sunday Truth Social rant after the film struggled to find an audience in its opening weekend.\"It's a cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country,\" Trump declared.In addition to calling out Trump's hypocrisy, Stan also spoke about whether or not the film could influence Americans before Election Day next month.\"I don't know, but what I do hope is that people, regardless of their opinion, are curious enough to try to dig deeper,\" he urged potential viewers. \"Because I think we're living in a world where it's so easy to be handed an opinion everywhere you turn.\"At its core, Stan says the film is about Trump \"as a character,\" telling people who see the film, \"Forget the politics and just go in there and use your instinct and ask yourself: Do you trust this man? That's what the movie is about.\"The film chronicles the presidential hopeful's antics as a New York City businessman in the 1970s and 1980s. Succession's Jeremy Strong also stars as Roy Cohn, Trump's real-life lawyer who acted as his nefarious right-hand man and mentor.",

    "content": "Ontario Premier Doug Ford has come under fire for his polarizing comments aimed at best-selling artist, Taylor Swift, who endorsed U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris for the 2024 presidential election last month.At a press conference on Tuesday, Ford spoke with reporters about the economic growth set to be facilitated by Swift's six-show stop at the Rogers Centre for her record-breaking Eras Tour.Ford praised Swift, saying that he \"can't wait until she comes here\" and drives economic growth. \"She's a brilliant business person and a musician. Boy, excuse the pun, but what a rockstar she is coming here and creating more jobs,\" he added.New data released by Destination Toronto reveals that Swift's concerts in Toronto throughout November could bring as much as $282 million in economic impact to the city. The tour, which is coming to Toronto on Nov. 14, 15, 16, 21, 22, and 23, is the highest-grossing tour of all time and the first in history to surpass US$1 billion in revenue.Despite this, Ford reportedly told the media that Swift \"should stick with music, and let the other folks stick with what they do best.\" After being posted to X, the quote was met with anger by Ontario residents and Swifties across the country, who called the Premier's comments \"misogynistic.\"Still, when asked if he's planning to attend any of Swift's Toronto shows, Ford replied, \"We'll see,\" with a smile.Leader of the Ontario NDP and Opposition, Marit Stiles, also got involved in the conversation and urged the Premier to go back to his \"sticker business.\"Others thought the comments didn't come as a surprise, and referenced a CityNews video from 2016 when Ford spoke highly about Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump and called his support for the controversial figure \"unwavering.\"In September, Swift endorsed Harris for the upcoming presidential election, calling her a \"steady-handed, gifted leader,\" and supported her decision to select Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate, who, she wrote, has been \"standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman's right to her own body for decades.\"Following Swift's endorsement, roughly 400,000 people clicked through from her Instagram account to a federal voting information site in 24 hours.",

    "content": "Suffice to say, Donald Trump isn't the biggest fan of Ali Abbasi's The Apprentice.Starring Sebastian Stan as the former president, The Apprentice is a drama set between the 1970s and 1980s that follows Trump's rise as a real estate businessman in New York and his relationship with lawyer and mentor Roy Cohn (played by Succession's Jeremy Strong).The film premiered at Cannes earlier this year, and currently holds a 79 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes. While critic reviews have generally been mixed, the Trump campaign has been ardent on its distaste toward the film with spokesperson Steven Cheung threatening legal action back in May and deeming it 'garbage' and 'pure fiction which sensationalizes lies that have been long debunked.'Although Trump was quiet on the film for sometime, the former president had some choice words to say about The Apprentice upon its release in theaters this week, writing on Truth Social: \"A FAKE and CLASSLESS Movie written about me, called, The Apprentice (Do they even have the right to use that name without approval?), will hopefully 'bomb.'\"It's a cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country,\" he continued.Trump went on to slam the film's depiction of his relationship with former wife, Ivana Trump (played by Guardians of the Galaxy's Maria Bakalova), writing: \"My former wife, Ivana, was a kind and wonderful person, and I had a great relationship with her until the day she died. The writer of this pile of garbage, Gabe Sherman, a lowlife and talentless hack, who has long been widely discredited, knew that, but chose to ignore it.\"So sad that HUMAN SCUM, like the people involved in this hopefully unsuccessful enterprise, are allowed to say and do whatever they want in order to hurt a Political Movement, which is far bigger than any of us. MAGA2024!,\" Trump concluded.The Apprentice's director, Ali Abbasi, previously addressed the controversy surrounding the film and the Trump campaign's backlash in May, saying he didn't think the film is one that Trump 'would dislike.'\"I don't necessarily think he would like it,\" he added. \"But I think he'd be surprised. So I'm happy to meet him, have a screening, and then we can discuss it afterwards.\"",

Trump argued the government of the United States has \"nasty\" and \"fascist\" leadership, and he was then asked who was really in charge.\"Well, I think it's a committee of people, and they might not even know who the committee is,\" Trump said on Glenn Beck's show on The Blaze. \"They may not even know themselves -- does that make sense?

Bush, who served as Reagan's vice president. Bush lost the election to Bill Clinton and pardoned Weinberger before he left office.A week before the 2000 election, it was revealed that George W.

    "content": "Mike Pence has declined to endorse Donald Trump in the 2024 US presidential election, but a widespread video purporting to show him urging Americans to vote for Kamala Harris over his one-time boss is deceptively edited. The original, uncut footage of the interview shows the former vice president saying he would \"never\" vote for the Democratic nominee.\"Drumroll please..... Pence endorses VP Harris and Governor Walz,\" says text over the video shared October 13, 2024 on TikTok.The clip appears to show Pence saying: \"Vote for Kamala Harris as president of the United States, or Tim Walz as her running mate, period, paragraph. And I think it's important that we understand exactly what's coming down the tracks from the other side. But in the same breath, I also think, we also need to think about who we are as conservatives.\"And between me and my former running mate, I cannot endorse President Trump's continuing assertion that I should have set aside my oath to support and defend the Constitution and acted in a way that would have overturned the election in January of 2021. I just cannot endorse this growing abandonment of our allies on the world stage that's taken hold in parts of our party. I cannot endorse ignoring our national debt that reached $35 trillion just in the last week.\"Similar posts spread the video across TikTok and other platforms, including X and Threads, as the race between Harris and Trump tightens in its final three weeks.Numerous prominent Republicans, including former vice president Dick Cheney and his daughter, ex-congresswoman Liz Cheney, have publicly backed Harris over their party's leader. Pence, who served four years beside Trump, also said in March that he would not be endorsing his former boss in 2024.The two grew distant after Trump tried to compel Pence to illegally overturn his 2020 election defeat to Joe Biden, a pressure campaign that resulted in a mob of Trump supporters violently storming the US Capitol -- some chanting \"Hang Mike Pence\" as they ransacked the building.But the video claimed to show Pence endorsing Harris has been misleadingly edited, omitting some remarks and stitching together others to distort what he said.The clip comes from Pence's August 9, 2024 interview with conservative radio host Erick Erickson at an event called \"The Gathering\" (archived here).In a lengthy response to a question about his views on the 2024 election, Pence said: \"I saw some people the other day who have defected to the other side, who were wondering where I would come down in this campaign.

'And then I went out interviewing people who knew Donald and Roy during those years and asked them for more anecdotes. So it was a mix of historical research plus my own interviews.'The rape scene is based on a divorce deposition from Ivana Trump that she later recanted in 2015 after he announced his first presidential run.He finished his office look with a pair of smart black leather shoes and a gold watchStan plays Trump and the Roy Cohn character is played by Jeremy Strong of Succession fame.The movie's director, Ali Abbasi, was in Washington, D.C. last week and told an audience there that he had initially thought about casting a woman in the Trump part.'There was a time before I started talking to Sebastian I thought that maybe it should be an actress playing Trump,' Abbasi said. 'Because I thought there was something awkward and off about his body language and I wanted to have that. I wanted to sort of play with that. And we tried it.'Speaking to DailyMail.com, Abbasi wouldn't reveal which actresses he spoke to about portraying Trump on the big screen, though he did say that he reached out to Cate Blanchett for advice, as she did a 'great job' playing Bob Dylan.'I did talk to a few people about that and I was serious about it,' Abbasi said in an interview Monday.'I did overlays of young Donald's face and different actresses that I was considering,' he continued. 'I talked to my prosthetics person and tried to figure out how we could solve it if someone had the good proportions or not.'Standing in front of a seas of photographers, Sebastian cut a serious display as he looked sternly down the barrel of the camerasAbbasi told DailyMail.com that he also conducted a voice test using a woman.'And in the end, I think, I just felt like the whole thing became too gimmicky,' he said.'It would go contrary to my goal, which was humanizing and, you know, capturing complexity. And it would become a movie about how you did that stunt,' the director said.And the team behind the Donald Trump biopic may be hearing the reality star's iconic phrase 'You're fired' following its disappointing box office debut.The film struggled to attract audiences, earning only an estimated $1.58 million despite a $16 million production budget and a release in 1,750 theaters.Its opening day results were particularly underwhelming, with the film grossing around $150,000 on Thursday.Sebastian appeared in his element as he posed with his fans for a selfieHe posed on the photocall alongisde his costars (pictured L to R: Ali Abbasi, Jeremy Strong, Maria Bakalova, and Sebastian)The new movie, The Apprentice, stars actor Sebastian Stan who portrays a young Donald Trump.

It does humanize Trump. But it also presents a plainly obvious depiction of how a man can turn into a monster with the right personality, background and guidance.

    "content": "Vice President Kamala Harris is vowing to take on \"corporate landlords\" for jacking up rent prices should she win in November. At the same time, executives from the \"biggest corporate landlord\" in the world are boosting her presidential bid with large donations.Harris's joint fundraising committee boasts a war chest with almost $800,000 from top employees at Blackstone, the massive private equity firm facing scrutiny from Senate Democrats for \"extreme rent hikes, illegal eviction, and other predatory practices,\" Federal Election Commission filings show. Jonathan Gray, the president of Blackstone, also donated $413,000 to the Harris Action Fund in late July, according to multiple reports.The large giving is a window into how Wall Street is lining up behind Harris ahead of the 2024 presidential election despite Harris long aiming to position herself as a politician who holds big business accountable. In July, at a campaign rally in Atlanta, the Democratic presidential nominee insisted she \"will take on corporate landlords and cap unfair rent increases.\"2024 ELECTIONS LIVE UPDATES: LATEST NEWS ON THE TRUMP-HARRIS PRESIDENTIAL RACEThe Harris campaign's economic plan, released in August, calls for stopping \"Wall Street investors from buying up and marking up homes in bulk.\"\"Community after community feels taken advantage of by Wall Street investors and distant landlords,\" the Harris economic plan says. \"Vice President Harris is calling on Congress to pass the Stop Predatory Investing Act to curtail these practices by removing key tax benefits for major investors who acquire large numbers of single-family rental homes.\"Harris's willingness to accept the Blackstone-linked donations is \"rank hypocrisy,\" according to Adam Gibbs, the spokesman for the right-leaning Opportunity Solutions Project advocacy group.\"Kamala Harris loves the free market when it comes to receiving campaign cash, but she hates it when it comes to setting sound policy for a nation in the midst of an affordability crisis,\" Gibbs said. \"And she thinks the American people are too gullible to notice.\"Featured Local SavingsAs she prepares to face off against Trump, Harris has a cadre of billionaire megadonors in the world of philanthropy, Silicon Valley, and Wall Street fueling her campaign, the Washington Examiner reported. Harris has notably received over $1 million from attorneys at the law firm Paul Weiss, which is favored by Wall Street and Big Tech, federal records show.The Harris campaign also chose the law firm Covington & Burling to help set up its transition team, CNN reported. That firm lobbies for many corporations, including semiconductor manufacturer Qualcomm, according to a report by Donald Shaw in Sludge.To Craig Holman, a lobbyist focused on campaign finance reform, \"special interests\" such as Blackstone are trying to protect themselves from government-led scrutiny in a Harris-Walz administration by giving money to both sides. Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman is a Trump supporter and donates to Republicans.\"It's the nature of our privately financed campaign finance system, special interests trying to curry favor,\" said Holman, who lobbies on ethics issues at the progressive Public Citizen think tank. \"They give her a lot of money, and maybe it will moderate her if she gets elected.\"\nThe Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\"Her hypocrisy on this issue shows she is more concerned with solving her political problems than solving the problems facing middle-class families,\" Gibbs said.",

    "content": "Vermont Public interviewed three candidates for Vermont governor on Tuesday. It was part of the station's series of debates and candidate interviews ahead of the general election on Nov. 5.Incumbent Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican from Berlin, is running for a fifth term. He previously served as lieutenant governor and a state senator. The Democratic candidate is Esther Charlestin of Middlebury. She runs an educational consulting business, co-chairs the Vermont Commission on Women and is a former Middlebury select board member. The independent candidate is Kevin Hoyt of Bennington, a former candidate for governor and seats in Vermont's House and Senate.Below are key highlights from the interviews. A full transcript has also been provided.AffordabilityWhen asked how to reduce the dual burdens of inflation and taxation on Vermonters' pocketbooks, Gov. Phil Scott said Vermont's demographics and declining population need to be at the center of any conversation about affordability. \"We need to grow the workforce. We need more kids, or we need to consolidate , and we have to get a handle on some of the expenses throughout.\"Esther Charlestin said expanding Medicaid would make living in Vermont more affordable, as would funding rental assistance programs. She also said she would \"get rid of regulatory barriers so we can increase our mixed housing.\"Kevin Hoyt said corruption is the root of Vermont's issues. \"I think corruption is a big problem. I think you're not the problem because you're made out of carbon. I think they're the problem and we cannot afford our corrupt government,\" he said.HomelessnessScott noted that Vermont does have a general assistance program that can help pay for shelter for people experiencing homelessness, but he believes the program has grown in an unsustainable way. He believes the state's focus should be on long-term housing solutions, and he advocated for more reforms to Act 250, Vermont's signature land use law, that go farther than the reform bill passed by the legislature earlier this year.Charlestin said the legislature should reinstate previous funding for the emergency motel housing program. She also wants to fund emergency shelters \"where we can provide mental health care, substance abuse treatment and, of course, empowering folks to get housing.\"When asked about reinstating funding for the motel housing program, Hoyt said \"I do believe we need to put people in hotels. We have people that are starving and dying on our streets.\" He went on to reiterate that government corruption is the root of the state's housing and affordability issues.ClimateEach of the candidates was asked a listener-submitted question about how they would help Vermont reach its emission reduction requirements, as outlined by the Global Warming Solutions Act.Gov. Phil Scott said climate change is a real threat, but he believes the legislature's current efforts to reduce emissions are too expensive for Vermonters. He noted that he vetoed the Global Warming Solutions Act when it came across his desk in 2020. \"We need to reduce emissions but we can't hurt people along the way to do it,\" he said.Esther Charlestin said she would support funding programs that would help more people buy electric vehicles, weatherize their homes and buildings, and access public transportation. \"Making it easier for folks to transition is important,\" she said.Kevin Hoyt said the Global Warming Solutions Act should be repealed, but his reasoning was very different from Scott's. \"The climate is changing because it's being manipulated and engineered,\" Hoyt said. \"It's called geoengineering.\" He then referenced debunked conspiracy theories such as chemtrails.TranscriptTranscripts are generated using a combination of speech recognition software and human transcribers and have been lightly edited for concision and clarity.

Today's show is part of our series of debates and candidate interviews ahead of the November 5th general election. Today we will be joined by three candidates for Vermont Governor. This year Vermont Public has adopted the Citizens Agenda approach to election coverage. More than 620 Vermonters have submitted questions for candidates and thoughts on the issues they care most about. You'll hear some of those today. To submit your own question for one of our other upcoming debates or candidate interviews, email us at vote-at-vermont-public-dot-org. My first three questions to each candidate will be about the same, followed by two questions on their specific records. The order of today's interviews was determined by the candidates' polling numbers in a recent statewide poll. That means we'll begin with Governor Phil Scott, a Republican, followed by Democrat-Progressive Esther Charlestin, and then independent Kevin Hoyt. Each candidate will have the same amount of airtime.Gov. Phil ScottMikaela Lefrak: Governor Scott is running for a 5th consecutive term as Vermont's governor. He previously served as lieutenant governor, and a state Senator. He lives in Berlin. Governor Scott, welcome.Gov. Phil Scott: Well, good afternoon, Mikaela.Mikaela Lefrak: So let's start with a question about the high cost of living here in Vermont, as I'm sure you could expect, Governor, this is an issue that came up time and time again in our Citizens Agenda, and a listener named Jeremy writes this \"I'm left leaning. My property taxes went up $1,200 in a year, and they're projected to increase next year. Food and gas have come at a much higher cost. Living in Vermont is becoming a thing for the wealthy and not for regular folks.\" What Jeremy asks can be done governor?Gov. Phil Scott: Well, first of all, he's not alone. We're seeing that across the state, affordability has been something I've talked about since day one, when I first was elected. Three principals were, you know, grow the economy, make Vermont more affordable and protect the most vulnerable. Eight years ago, we were spending. We were spending about, um, we were spending about $1.5 billion today we're spending about $2.4 billion. So, we also have, you know, a population that is declining, so we need to do something about it. We have the second highest spending per pupil in the nation, so we need to do things a little bit different. We need to grow the workforce. We need more kids, or we need to consolidate, and we have to get a handle on some of the expenses throughout. So, there are, you know, it's not just education, but that's one of them, healthcare as well, but a lot of it is due to our demographics. And again, I've talked about that a lot as well.Mikaela Lefrak: I want to dive in a little bit deeper to education spending. You brought it up. You mentioned we there need more kids. We need to consolidate small schools. Early financial forecast from your office showed that property taxes could rise again next year by an average of 7% even if school spending stays flat. And last month, you sent a letter to school leaders urging school boards to quote consider all options to contain education spending growth. But in that letter, I didn't see any specific recommendations, other than suggesting that school leaders reach out to the agency of education for support. Can you ask, what types of cost containment were you referring to that school board leaders can control?Gov. Phil Scott: Well, again, we've, over the past you know, eight years we've had a lot of ideas that we brought to the legislature have been rejected by the legislature along the way, but towards the end, you know, we multiple healthcare proposals we've been we've been asking for a while, a five year plan to freeze rates so that we can invest more in in kids. We've got to use natural attrition to bring the staff to student ratio down, and we still have the lowest if we were able to do that, we have to look at the funding formula as well. I think that's important, because even though schools work hard to try and keep their costs down, they don't always benefit, because it's all put into a big pot, the invoices are pretty much sent to Montpelier, and then everyone pays relatively same. So it doesn't reward some of the school districts who are trying to do the right thing. So again, this year, we offered to use existing revenue to buy down rates. We thought we should have a growth rate to cap the increases next year as a bridge to long term reform, and the legislature wasn't interested. And so we're in the situation we are right now. And instead, they decided to put in place another study, yet another one. I mean, we've had dozens of them over the over the years, and I don't expect that it'll say anything different than what we've heard before. In fact, the legislature actually had a proposal on the table for about 24 hours towards the ends of the session. A lot included a lot of the things that we talked about and they pulled it off the table. So again, this study waiting for that, I think was a mistake. I think we should have just done the hard work, put in some cost containment measures in between, and then long-term reform. Because if we don't, if we don't do anything about the structural reform, structural reforms need in the education system, this isn't going to get any better, and that's why we decided to send out a letter so that we could, we could warn people about what's what's going to happen.Mikaela Lefrak: Okay, let's move on to another topic that goes hand in hand with affordability, and that's housing. We got a message from Matt in Burlington, who works for an agency that assists the unhoused, and Matt says they've seen an extraordinary rise in need over the last year, and Matt may also be forced to leave Vermont as the cost of housing has become untenable for them. Now that's bringing up two intertwined housing issues, and I want to start with homelessness. Hundreds of Vermonters were exited from the state's motel housing program this fall. Do you think the state has a responsibility to ensure those folks, those same folks, are housed over the winter?Gov. Phil Scott: Well, again, we do have a general assistance program. We work with the legislature. They pass something that that I think will help in that regard, as a reminder. You know, we, when I first came into office, we were spending about $3 million a year for our general assistance program for those who are homeless. About four years later, it grew to about $70 million, and that's just not sustainable. It also isn't good for the people who are putting in some of those situations. I mean, they're in isolation, they're not getting the help they need, the addiction issues, mental health issues they might have. Drug dealers were preying upon them in the in the hotels, there were deaths, overdoses and so forth. So, what we need to do is we need more housing. I mean, the bottom line is, the answer to almost all of this is more housing, more choices, more affordable housing, because there's some in the program that just can't find a place to live and that's just not that's not acceptable, and that's why, you know, two years ago, legislators, many, many legislative most, all of them were, were average, you know, campaigning on the premise of more housing. And once they got there, it was, it seemed to fall on deaf ears. I mean, we had a tri-partisan agreement early on, and that bill that we all agreed to tri-partisan support never came off the wall. Said they passed the conservation bill, and we're seeing the results of that. We're not, we're not building as much housing as we need.Mikaela Lefrak: Yeah, I want to, can I ask you about what you just called the conservation bill, and you're referring to the overhaul to Act 250 the Vermont legislature passed earlier this year. You vetoed this bill saying that, as you just did, it's more a conservation bill than a development bill, and it wasn't doing nearly, and it isn't doing nearly enough to build and restore homes in rural communities. I do want to point out, as I'm sure you know, that it does set up a number of exemptions, including for projects of up to 50 units in dozens of village centers around the state. So why, why have you to a bill that allows something like that? What was it specifically about this bill that caused you to say, no, this is not right, again?Gov. Phil Scott: Again, it was just short-term solutions. It was only for two years some of these the regulatory reform you're referring to, and then it gets worse. Then we need more than two years to put us back on track. We we're going to need 24 to 36,000 more homes by 2029. As the you know, others have reflected on, home prices have gone up about. 38% half of renters spend more than 30% of their income on housing. So we need more we have more demand than we have supply and, you know, it's a basic economic principle we need. We need more supply and less demand so that will drive some of the prices down. But, you know, government can't do everything in this, so we have to clear the way. We need tax incentives. We need more regulatory reform. If this is truly a crisis that everyone says it is, then we will, we will act accordingly. You know, during the flooding we saw during the pandemic, we had a state of emergency in place, and we had to do some things that were uncomfortable to many. And I think if this is truly, truly a crisis, then we're gonna have to get uncomfortable, and we're gonna have to stretch much further than they went. I'm not saying that what they did was not helpful, but it was just a stopgap measure and we need more of it for a longer period of time.Mikaela Lefrak: Well, I'd like to move on to another issue that came up time and time again in our Citizens Agenda answers that were submitted by listeners of Vermont Public, and that was climate. To address concerns around the warming climate in 2020 the Vermont legislature passed the Global Warming Solutions Act, which, for folks who aren't aware, created these legally binding emission reduction requirements. And the first deadline is rapidly approaching. By 2025, Vermont needs to reduce its greenhouse gas pollution to 26% below 2005 levels. Anne in Williston asks, What will you do to ensure that Vermont meets the Act's emission reductions requirement? And I'll add, Governor, do you think the Global Warming Solutions Act should be repealed?Gov. Phil Scott: Well, as you probably know, Mikaela, I veto that bill. I didn't think it was constitutional, nor did I think it was achievable, and we're seeing it in real time. Now. Why setting arbitrary mandates and essentially asking special interest groups to sue us? It's just the wrong approach, and they've done that. So this isn't going to help. Climate change is real, and we're seeing the impacts of more severe weather right now, and I propose hundreds of millions of dollars to help people transition to carbon free solutions. I, you know, the vehicle that I ride around in every day is a Ford lightning. I don't think there's any other governor in the country that has an electric vehicle. We need to reduce emissions, but we're going, you know, it's taught me a lot too, because it's not going to be a flick of the switch. It's not going to happen overnight. We have to make sure that we have the grid that can, that can produce the power we need to transition to electric vehicles, and we need charging more charging stations. You know, we can't we need to reduce emission, but we can't hurt people along the way to do it. The clean heat standard, the renewable energy standard, or carbon tax, that's just going to hurt people. So let's, let's work together to figure out a way to get to where we want to go, much like we did with water quality in the early days of my governorship. And I think we can get there without raising all these taxes and forcing people to do things they can't afford to do.Mikaela Lefrak: Governor, now you're going to have me spending my afternoon fact checking whether or not you're the only governor with an electric vehicle.Gov. Phil Scott: I don't know of any others that do but when I've gone to some of the conventions, they've remarked that they'd like to, but they haven't been able to do it. So, I've offered advice.Mikaela Lefrak: Well, Governor, you have one of the highest approval ratings of any governor in the country. You've been reelected numerous times, but those same voters are also electing the democratic state senators and representatives that you often heavily criticize, including during this conversation. So, I just want to ask you, point blank, do you think voters in Vermont are making the wrong choice again and again at the ballot box when they're reelecting their Democratic legislators?Gov. Phil Scott: Well, I guess in this case, I think we need more common-sense candidates to step up and run, and we see some of them right now who have done so. And that's across the board, both Republicans and Democrats and independents alike. We are losing some of those more common sense, Practical Democrats who Blue Dogs, so to speak, the Bobby Stars, of course, my good friend, Dick Mazza, Dick Sears and so forth. Jane Kitchel, there are many who we won't have in the next cycle. But I don't think you know, I know many people think, because of the supermajority, that the people must have elected that and that was their goal, but I don't think they did it for that reason. I think they think they know their legislators, they but they haven't checked on how they vote, and I think that that's important, and something I've advocated for. When they go in the ballot box this time, they have to check their record, do some, do some, some fact checking themselves, and see how they voted, make sure it aligns with what they're seeing and feeling, whether it's about the affordability of Vermont or whatever it is, and make sure they, you know, find some people to work with me so that we can, we can accomplish the goals that we need to make Vermont more affordable and a more attractive place to live.Mikaela Lefrak: Well, my last question for you, Governor actually ties into that question of alignment. Many voters who support you wrote to us through our Citizens Agenda, concerned about your affiliation with the Republican Party, and they want to know why you continue to be a part of the organization the party, excuse me, despite vocally opposing former President Donald Trump as candidate.Gov. Phil Scott: Yeah, well, I call them as I see them. I think we need more moderation on both sides. We need more people in the middle. I think that's where most, most Vermonters are, most Americans are, but they have the loudest voices on the extremes of both parties, and so they get the most attention, and it becomes more polarized, and we need to bring people together. Me changing parties or disavowing the Republican Party, that's not going to help our country in the long run, what we need is just more civility, respect, bringing people together, and then voting your conscience. Vote the way your constituency wants you to vote, and I think that I've done that, I've been clear I'm not going to support former President Trump in the next election, but at the same time, I think that we have a lot of work to do right here in our own backyard. I think there's a possibility, if we can just get more like-minded centrists and moderates in the legislature, I think we will have a more affordable Vermont. We'll have more housing. We'll get some things done. And I think that that, you know, if that happens a few years from now, I think we'll just see less polarization, both in the state, but outside our borders as well.Mikaela Lefrak: Who do you plan to vote for in the 2024, presidential election?Gov. Phil Scott: Well, again, I've been clear I won't be voting for Donald Trump, but, but I'm focusing on what we're doing here. I'll like I did the last time. I'll let people know how I voted after I vote, I didn't endorse a candidate in the last election, and I'm not ready to do that in this election either.Mikaela Lefrak: Governor Phil Scott, thank you so much for your time today. We appreciate it.Gov. Phil Scott: Thank you.Mikaela Lefrak: Phil Scott is a Republican from Berlin. He's one of the three gubernatorial candidates we are speaking with today ahead of the November 5 election coming up on Vermont Edition, Democrat Esther Charleston, we are not taking any calls today. This is Vermont edition. Stay with us.Esther CharlestinMikaela Lefrak: Esther Charlestin joins us now. She co-chairs the Vermont Commission on Women and runs an educational consulting firm. She's also a former Middlebury Selectboard member. Esther, good to talk to you again.Esther Charlestin: Thank you for having me.Mikaela Lefrak: Now, let's start, as we did with Gov. Phil Scott, with a question about affordability. I'll remind you a listener named Jeremy wrote to us about their property taxes going up $1,200 in a year, the cost of food and gas increasing, and they're feeling like Vermont is only a place for the wealthy. What they ask can be done to decrease these dual burdens of inflation and taxation. Esther?Esther Charlestin: Thank you for the question. Affordability is definitely a concern, and how do we make Vermont more affordable? Honestly, I think about healthcare. So, expanding Medicaid, so that folks with low to mid income are able to be covered. I think about housing, housing, housing. Housing is a huge piece. Rent, I mean, a two bedroom is easily $2,500 a month. And so how do people make it? So, making sure that folks have access to programs so that they can afford, making sure we get rid of regulatory barriers so we can increase our mixed housing, so that folks have options.Mikaela Lefrak: So in our primary debates for the Democratic nomination for governor, you said that you would support the legislature passing tax credits for people who can't afford their property taxes or bills. Could you provide more specifics on what you were suggesting there specifically how those tax credits would be funded?Esther Charlestin: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I would say giving folks an option. I think about maybe a widower who has a huge house, is on a fixed income and cannot afford her property taxes. Or I think about a family who bought a house, you know, a few years ago and has a strict budget and can't afford it going up, giving them an opportunity to ask for help and get the help that they need to be able to stay in Vermont, because that is the goal, especially with an aging population. We want people to stay here and thrive here. One of the ways I could see us really helping and funding with that, I am in support of, like, a progressive tax system where higher income individuals pay a higher tax rate.Mikaela Lefrak: Are you referring there to a so-called wealth tax, increasing taxes on Vermonters who earn $500,000 or more, or increasing taxes on people who earn less than $500,000 as well?Esther Charlestin: I would say $500,000 or more, yes.Mikaela Lefrak: We also got a question from Ralph in Essex Junction, who is hoping to hear about some actionable steps that the gubernatorial candidates could take before the next town meeting day to prevent the same type of property tax increases that we experienced this year. And Ralph requests here, please don't suggest study groups, committee referrals or other generalities, only actionable steps you will take.Esther Charlestin: So once again, I would absolutely give folks credit who need it. They can apply to programs to ask for assistance. Again, the progressive taxing system that would make a difference would be a start, of course, not sustainable, but a start, to get us to a place where we can have a sustainable plan. Because right now, the way we fund education, it's not sustainable, and we need a new formula, so making sure we figure out what the best formula is and how do we get relief for people now would be a focus.Mikaela Lefrak: You brought up housing earlier. Let's hone into that a bit more. A Burlington resident who works with people experiencing homelessness wrote to us and said that not only have they seen an increase in need at their organization, but they are now struggling to find affordable housing for themselves. Regarding homelessness in Vermont, do you think the state should reinstate the motel voucher program that it recently cut funds from as soon as this winter? And if so, how should it pay for it?Esther Charlestin: I would say it would be a start. I believe in a housing first approach, really getting folks housed. Winter is coming. We feel the temperatures dropping even in the evenings, 55, and to know that in our communities, there are families, children in tents. I think of Middlebury, because I would be in the library, there's like a small tent community, there in the back, and people don't have a place to go, and so putting them out on the street, especially when winter is coming, is not okay. So yes, housing first approach, and making sure that we have emergency shelters where we can provide mental health care, substance abuse treatment, and of course, empowering folks to get housing and stay in the house that they have so that it can be permanent would be important.Mikaela Lefrak: But to go back to the motel voucher programming, the Democratic majority legislature has agreed to start continually cutting this program down to reduce costs. It was initially funded in large part by the federal government and money that came in during the pandemic. So are you saying that you disagree with the legislature's decision to cut funds from this program?Esther Charlestin: I believe that housing first is important, so putting them out on the street right now is actually creating more problems, because the fund, the spending, doesn't go away. Right now, the burden is on communities, it's on school districts. People rallying to get tents together for families, and the communities are feeling those pressures so the cost doesn't go away. Emergency rooms are feeling that pressure, and it's important that we care for the people here, and especially those who don't haveMikaela Lefrak: I want to ask you another follow up question from something that you brought up during our primary debate. It was about the housing crisis, and you said that in my administration, we would be committed to supporting changes in zoning policies and to help remove those barriers. Gov. Phil Scott has criticized the Act 250 reforms that were passed by the legislature this year as not going far enough to make it easier to build in rural downtowns. I'm curious what you think. Do you think that that bill went far enough?Esther Charlestin: I believe that bill is a start. It's a start, but we need more, right? We need more work.Mikaela Lefrak Sorry, would you have would you have vetoed it like Gov. Scott? I just want to be clear, if you think it went far enough.Esther Charlestin: Okay, yes, I don't believe it went far enough, and no, I wouldn't have vetoed it. I would have had that conversation beforehand with folks about, okay, how do we make it go even further? Would be my approach.Mikaela Lefrak: Well, let's move on to another big topic that we heard about from our Citizens Agenda, and that is climate change, energy and the environment. To address concerns around the warming climate, the Vermont legislature passed what's called the Global Warming Solutions Act, and it has these legally binding emission reductions requirements in it. We got an email from a listener named Anne in Williston who asks, What will you do to ensure that Vermont meets the Act's emission reductions requirements?Esther Charlestin: Yes, so I would have programs to help with the overall energy demand. I would, really my administration and I would really work on making sure electric vehicles- I know the governor spoke earlier about having an electric vehicle -- well, making sure that everybody has the option to transition if they want to. And so that would be huge. Our public transportation, making sure that that is strong and not only in the cities but in rural areas, making sure that they have the support that they need to get across so getting more people off the roads. Thinking about weatherization programs, programs that make homes and buildings more energy efficient, making sure folks have access to these programs and that they know about it, because a lot of folks don't know.Mikaela Lefrak: I'm curious to hear more about one thing you just said increasing access to public transportation in rural areas. That has been something that Vermont has struggled with. It can cost a lot of money to try to expand public transportation systems in places where there's low population. Can you tell me a bit more about your vision for that and how you would go about achieving it?Esther Charlestin: Yeah, I would start, so we probably would not have the big busses, but more so the smaller busses, and making sure we would have a schedule that, and working with the town what are the needs, and then really figuring out how to support them and their needs. So that means people going to the hospitals or what have you, that they are able to access that. So it would, it would take some time. I'm working together with the different communities, but I believe it's important, and one will make a priority.Mikaela Lefrak: One more question about the climate here. We had a whole program yesterday about the Affordable Heat Act and the Clean Heat Standard. There's lots of very intense feelings about it from both sides right now. One thing that I find interesting is that  lower income households, studies show they use less energy and have lower carbon footprints than more affluent households do, and therefore helping them electrify isn't necessarily the most cost effective way to reduce emissions for Vermont overall. But the Affordable Heat Act, it requires that roughly a third of clean heat credits come from work that serves low and moderate income households. It's one of the parts of the Affordable Heat Act that continues to be debated. I'm curious what your thoughts are. Do you think that part of the law is flawed?Esther Charlestin: As I think about how much oil cost, I think making that transition to electrifying would be cheaper, as I used to pay for oil for our house, and it is not pretty until that comes and plus, it's a sacrifice. So what it means is they might not have the heat running all the time, right? So the lower cost is because during the day, there's no heat in the house, but at night, so you come home to a freezing house, but at night you may and some people go without. So I think making it easier for folks to transition is important and they have the option. The goal is for them to have the option.Mikaela Lefrak: Now, Esther Charlestin, you have criticized Gov. Scott in the past for vetoing policies, many policies passed by the Democratic majority legislature, but Vermonters do continue to elect him time and again. He's running for a fifth term right now, and many have told us that they appreciate the balance that he's bringing to the legislative process in Vermont, so I'm curious about how you would approach your role and the relationship with the legislature. If it does remain a Democratic supermajority, are there any policies from recent legislative sessions that you would have vetoed or if elected? Do you think you would work in lockstep with that Democratic legislature?Esther Charlestin: Well, my approach would be very different. I would work on building a relationship, work on collaboration, work on negotiation and compromise, finding win-win solutions, and that looks like having regular meetings with folks, having open communication, and having a presence, and letting them know that I'm reachable and we want to work together. I think with that approach, we can get a lot more done.Mikaela Lefrak: Let's dive in a little bit deeper to one topic that you brought up earlier, which was education, that we haven't gotten into too much. Vermont has among the highest per pupil spending rates in America. You're a former employee of Middlebury Middle School, so I'm curious from your perspective on the ground in Vermont's school system, if you've witnessed any areas of education spending that you think could be cut, or do you think the current price tag of education is sustainable?Esther Charlestin: What comes to mind for me is, what are we paying for? Of course, I understand that we pay for vouchers for people to be able to send their kids to school in other countries. So, I would explore that. What I've seen in our public schools is that we're really doing the best we can with what we have, right. And a lot of folks have lost their jobs over the past year when I think about the budget cuts. So a lot more people are holding so much and juggling so much to really meet the needs of our students. A huge part of my job was discipline, right? And I had two behavioral interventionists who helped run the office, and we were called to different places, and it was so helpful to have that support, to really meet the needs of the students, especially the students who needed maybe to step out of class or what have you. So what I saw firsthand, no, I don't think we should be cutting staff support, because teachers aren't going anywhere. And the admin, we definitely need to help make sure it goes round. I believe we need to look at what we're spending the money on, and I would point out the vouchers.Mikaela Lefrak: So you've worked in the school system, and you've also formally served as a Middlebury Selectboard member. It was your last political post. What would you say to Vermonters, who might agree with your values and your policy proposals but worry that you lack that on the ground political experience to serve as governor and oversee thousands of state employees?Esther Charlestin: Absolutely. Thank you for that question. I would say, honestly, I've gotten to where I am because I've learned to identify some incredible experts in their field, and I've learned to bring people together. And even in the work I do now as an educational consultant, I help people have hard conversations and sit through it. The good news is I won't be leading alone, right? The governor has a cabinet. So who would I bring together to really help us make informed decisions, to make Vermont a great state for all of us so we can all thrive. And by that I mean those who are the one percent to the ones who are homeless, and making sure that everybody's considered in making this state great. So I know how to bring people together and experts together and really work together with folks to get us to a great place. And that is a strength that I believe would make a world of a difference.Mikaela Lefrak: Esther Charlestin is Democrat Progressive from Middlebury running for governor. Esther Charlestin, thank you so much for joining us today.Mikaela Lefrak: Welcome back to Vermont Edition, I'm Mikaela Lefrak. Today's show is part of our series of debates and candidate interviews ahead of the November 5th general election. Today we are hearing from three candidates for Vermont Governor. Our third and final candidate today is Independent Kevin Hoyt of Bennington. He's previously run for governor, and seats in the Vermont House and Vermont Senate. Kevin Hoyt, welcome to Vermont Edition.Kevin Hoyt: Hey, Mikaela, thank you very much for having me.Mikaela Lefrak: We're glad to have you. Let's start, as we did with Governor Scott and Esther Charleston, with affordability a major issue that we heard about time and again through our Citizens Agenda approach to election coverage here at Vermont Public, a listener named Jeremy wrote in to us about their property taxes going up $1,200 in a year. The cost of food and gas increasing, and they're feeling like Vermont is only a place for the wealthy. What can be done to decrease these burdens of inflation and taxation?Kevin Hoyt: Well, right now, from the you know, the other candidates and legislation in general, I'm hearing a lot of the blame game. I'm hearing a lot of we need more money, but no real policy or solutions. Per the Center for Public Integrity, Vermont scored number one once again, three years in a row in corruption. I don't know if people have checked out. There's a viral video going around right now, they ruined my hometown. It's about Burlington by a gentleman named Peter Santenello. Again, I think corruption is a big problem. I think you're not the problem because you're made out of carbon. I think they're the problem and we cannot afford our corrupt government anymore.Mikaela Lefrak: Uh, sorry. Can you clarify what you're saying there? The part about some people will be made of carbon and they're not the problem, but other people are sure.Kevin Hoyt: Well, again, I believe that's, you know, part of the Global Warming Solutions Act, and I think it's another, well, it's misguided to say the very least. But the problem is it's insustainable  what we have right now, and it's your government had one job, and it was to protect you. Do you feel protected? Do you feel represented? You know, maybe I should start by saying that I don't want to govern anyone. I don't think everybody listening to this. You guys are Vermonters. You're great people. You don't need me or Phil Scott or anybody to tell you what to do. What we need is to govern this out of control system. All systems are crashing right now, from education to taxation to again. The problem is they're overzealous, frivolous spending, lack of accountability and corruption in general. It's the cost of living. You want to cut the cost of living. Here's some new words for you. You don't hear from politicians, tax break, tax cut. Here's another one, return on investment, right? These guys, again, they think their job is to think of ways to, you know, spend your money and how to come up with new laws to restrict you. I think our problem is our government. So my goal is to get a grip on the corruption that's sweeping, you know, from massive election fraud to embezzlement and money laundering to - I'm a reporting party for our multi state, federal Rico investigation, and I've got a lot of questions for Phil Scott, our other legislators, but then there never seems to be a venue or an opportunity for the people to actually ask these questions.Mikaela Lefrak: I want to be clear about the type of corruption that you're pointing to. Are you saying that you think that there's an election fraud going on in Vermont?Kevin Hoyt: Yeah, my venture started in 2018 again, we mentioned Governor Phil Scott, the most popular, you know, governor in the history of the United States. Well, it helped that we had 102% turnout. We had more ballots than legal age voters.Mikaela Lefrak: Where's that data coming from?Kevin Hoyt: That's again, from the Center for Public Integrity, right, from all these election. Vermont doesn't even handle our own elections. They're done out of LHS management, out of Salem, New Hampshire, I released over 500 fraudulent names in a county of 5500 people, and that was just the a's and the b's. And even better than the crime, we got the cover up right and two documents and their letterhead and their words with their signatures on the bottom, no one even looked at any of the election fraud. So, you know this, this, I think this is -Mikaela Lefrak: I just want to jump in here, because we have had the Secretary of State on Vermont Edition numerous times who we've asked her about election fraud. She says there's no evidence of any sort of wide scale election fraud that's been going on. Are you saying that those election officials are lying?Kevin Hoyt: Absolutely. In fact, James Condos, I believe, not only is he responsible for all the matching EIN numbers we live in a society of shell companies, right for embezzlement and money laundering, but he's also responsible for elections. So first of all, we wouldn't want the Secretary of State to check themselves, would we? That's a bad idea. So the Secretary of State is administrative agency. It always falls back to your board of civil authority and your local town clerks. And what do you know? We couldn't get our elected officials to look at election fraud, and even if we could -Mikaela Lefrak: So you're saying that Vermont shouldn't trust its local town clerks either,Kevin Hoyt: I'll repeat I released over 500 names in a county of 5500 people. That was just the A's and half the B's. Okay,Mikaela Lefrak: well, I don't want to go too, too deep on this issue.Kevin Hoyt: We can. We can go just from, you know, the fact, remember, we used to have election day instead of election months.Mikaela Lefrak: So you're saying you do not agree that Vermont should have early voting?Kevin Hoyt: I do not. I think mail in ballots are, you know, a ridiculous practice. In fact, this is why we have more ballots than legal age voters. That's a problem for me.Mikaela Lefrak: Is that something you would take action about if you were elected governor, to get rid of absolutely early voting?Kevin Hoyt: Absolutely, I think they already are. I think that's why James Condos is no longer with us again. Vermont doesn't handle our own elections. They're all done. Vermont and another eight states out of the LHS out of Salem New Hampshire was their subsidiary of Dominion, right? So again, I think the corruption, again, is a major, a major things, if you want to go right into the cut and dry, because I'm not here at any policies out of anybody else, but I have, you know, four executive orders. Number one is term limits. I plan on executive order writing myself and all of them out of a job, because I don't see them voting themselves out. We need to make sure this accumulation of wealth and power never happens again. I like Bobby Kennedy's idea to ban poison farming practices. Why do we have poison farming practices to start with? But the aerosol spraying?Mikaela Lefrak: Can I just jump in here? Because I want to make sure that listeners have context for a number of the things that you're listing off here. Specifically, you've brought James Condos. You're referring to Jim Condos, Vermont Secretary of State, who retired a couple years ago after 35 years in Vermont government. You said he was no longer with us. So I just want to be clear that he retired.Kevin Hoyt: I don't believe he retired. And again, this is where we can get into it. Mikaela, but again, let's -Mikaela Lefrak: Can we move on? I'd love to move on. Rather than speculating about what Jim Condos is doing.Kevin Hoyt: Well we can talk about evidence if you want to get into evidence. Again, we have matching EIN numbers, illegal matching EIN numbers. So, the Vermont Sheriff's Association.Mikaela Lefrak: Can I ask you about housing, because that's an issue that our listeners asked us to ask you about, not EIN numbers or voter fraud. It did not come up in our citizens as often as other issues.Kevin Hoyt: I was going to give you example -Mikaela Lefrak: I feel like we covered it. So can we move on now to housing? So I want to ask you the same questions that I asked the other candidates and housing was a major topic. The motel voucher program used to pay for many hundreds of Vermonters to stay in motels and hotels. That program has been cut recently. It was a cost cutting measure by the Vermont legislature. Do you think that Vermont should continue to cut the motel voucher program to reduce those costs or reinstate it and figure out a way to pay for it.Kevin Hoyt: Well, this is a very complicated issue, but again, I do believe we need to put people in hotels. We have people that are starving and dying on our streets. So people, first, we have to take care of them. But again, we go back to that cost of living and the taxes, the fact that your property taxes just quadrupled, right? The fact that we're paying $39,000 per student per the education racket, right? You guys are being robbed out there. And again, it's amazing to me that you're not interested in any of the evidence of corruption, but this --Mikaela Lefrak: I gave you time to discuss it, and then decided to move on to a different again,Kevin Hoyt: I think housing again. It goes back to the cost of living and our unaffordable government. In fact, we've got a lot of vacant buildings going on. You know, all throughout Vermont, we call them our official buildings, right? Montpelier is pretty hollow. The Secretary of State, you just mentioned, she won't call me back like the attorney general. The second one, TJ Donovan, I think, was removed also, but there's no -Mikaela Lefrak: He got a new job. He was not removed from office.Kevin Hoyt: They're locked. The Secretary of State's building is locked, just like the Bennington Police Department, right? We have a lot of missing officials, over 150 --Mikaela Lefrak: Well, a number of official buildings in Montpelier were damaged by the floods and have not yet reopened.Kevin Hoyt: This was before that. It was covid, worker shortages, supply chains, you know. So again, this is the corruption.Mikaela Lefrak: I don't think I know. I don't want you to imply that.Kevin Hoyt: Well, we should have actual interviews. But the question again, regarding housing is, I do believe we need to house the homeless, and again, this incredible, growing homeless population that we have, right are, you can blame your legislator, you can you can blame, you know, the, I say, the 50-60, years of Democrat super majority, if you want to get into it and look at it, when are the people going to takeMikaela Lefrak: There hasn't been a 50 or 60 years of democratic super majority. I think that the super majority just occurred recently. There was a Democratic majority prior.Kevin Hoyt: The late 60s until the mid 90s. In fact, Ralph Wright the longest Speaker of the House in Democrat history. He's also one of my friends, and his son is also a federally deposed rico, you know, reporter. Rico, racketeering. We've all been racketeered Mikaela. These EINS that you don't want to talk about.Mikaela Lefrak: I gave you your time to talk about voter fraud, and now would like to move on to other topics that are from our Citizens Agenda that listeners brought up. That I asked the other candidates about. I want to make sure that I'm asking you the same questions that I asked to our other candidates.Kevin Hoyt: If you want to fix the housing you have to fix the tax fraud, the bank fraud, the corruption within our own government.Mikaela Lefrak: Let's move on to climate change. As I mentioned earlier to the other candidates, the Vermont legislature passed the Global Warming Solutions Act, which created legally binding emission reductions requirements. We got a question from Anne in Williston, who wants to hear from each of the candidates about what you will do to ensure that Vermont meets the Act's emission reduction requirements. I'm also hoping that you could start with what you think of the Global Warming Solutions Act itself.Kevin Hoyt: I think it should be repealed. I think it's, you know, impossible. I think these people don't know what they're asking for. Climate change is very, very real. The climate is changing because it's being manipulated and engineered. It's called geoengineering. It's not even a hard search. People should research the dimming documentary. Again, back to my executive orders. I plan on adding, I think what is there, eight or nine states right now that are banning the poisoning of their citizens, aerosol spraying, geoengineering, chemtrails for people. They're building our skies right with aluminum burial  --Mikaela Lefrak: Chemtrails is a debunked conspiracy theory.Kevin Hoyt: No, it's not a debunk. They actually admit it. But I'd love to have an interview with you guys. And again, Bobby Kennedy, right, is going to ban along with the other eight states. It's amazing, Mikaela, why would eight states be banning something that doesn't exist?Mikaela Lefrak: Well, I don't think anyone's saying that aerosol sprays don't exist.Kevin Hoyt: Look it. I'm an environmentalist, a humanitarian, and I've been a lifelong conservationist. You want to talk about the environment in green, the solutions they're providing are not green. They're very, very bad for the earth, right? In the meantime, this is another government created problem. The solution is to restrict you and then tax you more. This is CCP, you know, engineered propaganda, the green energy lie. Again, it's changing because it's being engineered, and that's very well documented. Mr. Kennedy has a lot to say on it, but a lot of other people do too. It's not even a hard search.Mikaela Lefrak: Can we get back to our listener's question about ensuring that Vermont meets emission reduction requirements? I heard you said that you don't agree that Vermont should have reduction requirements. Do you think that people in Vermont in the United States should be trying to reduce their emissions in order to address global warming?Kevin Hoyt: I do think there's other solutions, but it's stuff you, I've seen engines that run on water. I've seen engines that run on air, right? The problem is that doesn't fit into their system. So I think we've got remarkable solutions coming for Vermont state and the nation, but the green energy lie is just that, a lie. Who thinks it's a good idea to put our entire transportation system on an already failing electrical grid, and the same people are making the money. You know, Gov. Phil Scott and his electric truck, right? He didn't tell you that he paid way too much to start with. That was a bad decision, Phil. On top of that, it weighs about twice as much as your average vehicle, so we're going to have to, you know, put in all new roads and bridges. This is a long term loss. You guys remember the Industrial Revolution?Mikaela Lefrak: I'm going to bring us back because we have a couple more questions for you. We're speaking with independent gubernatorial candidate Kevin Hoyt. Kevin, in July, you were arrested on outstanding warrants for three cases of intentionally violating a stalking order against a former state representative. You argued in court that restraining orders violate your first amendment rights. Do you believe that restraining orders themselves are unconstitutional?Kevin Hoyt: Oh, no, absolutely not. I think there's great reasons for restraining orders. You guys have to actually go back and look at that now. I love that you brought it up, Mikaela because my crime was trying to report felony gun crimes and other capital crimes by our officials. So what that did is it got me a court order because our courts are complicit-Mikaela Lefrak: And just to be clear, there is no there's no proof of that crime. I don't want you to use this platform to make an unsubstantiated claim against another Vermonter.Kevin Hoyt: I've got video evidence of a House of Representative who's passing gun control for Vermonters while violating felony gun law himself.Mikaela Lefrak: I don't want you to use this platform to make those claims you have already been brought to court-Kevin Hoyt: -because I did it got me a court order, Mikaela-Mikaela Lefrak: I'm worried that this is going to become a platform for another one, Kevin Hoyt. I do want to move on because I --Kevin Hoyt: -- you asked me a question, you should let me answer it. So the court said that I couldn't verbally say a name, and I absolutely could not share evidence of these crimes. So I believe in the First Amendment, freedom of speech and freedom of the press, so I shared that. That got me a warrant for violating the no stalking order, right? Meanwhile, this gentleman who I can't name because I'd violate- he's got a 19 page criminal NCIC record, multiple batteries on women and law enforcement. He held his wife hostage with a shotgun.Mikaela Lefrak: What would you say to Vermonters who look at your relationship with this former state representative and worry about how you would conduct yourself with legislators if you were elected governor? This is clearly a very contentious relationship.Kevin Hoyt: Well, it is because I don't believe in corruption. I think these people are taking advantage of you, the good people of Vermont, I think they're robbing you blind. And I would love to get into policy. I don't know if we're going to have actual time.Mikaela Lefrak: I've asked you a number of questions about policy.Kevin Hoyt: Okay, well, again, I've got a way out of the opioid crisis. You guys want a huge boost of economic growth and development. We should look at that, a way out, a proven way out. I think people should look at that. Education is simple, right? First of all, we get the state out of education, along with the Chinese core curriculum. We give rights back to the parents, and it's as simple as charter school, private school, and home school, and the money follows the student. But we gotta get these ridiculous, you know, costs down. Again, the cost of living, the corruption, your taxes, your criminal government, all these matching EIN numbers --Mikaela Lefrak: I'd like to just give you one more chance to answer my final question, and then we will be out of time. What would you say to Vermonters who look at your relationship with this former state representative and they worry about how you would conduct yourself in Montpelier if you were elected governor?Kevin Hoyt: I think I would conduct myself in a similar standpoint. If I see corruption in crimes by our officials, I'm going to call it out. I think it's time for accountability in this state. I think it's time to give the government back to the people and stop the corruption. That's going to take care of again, maybe I'll let you keep some of your own money, right? We've got it. We're going to legalize plant medicine. I think we need to become a Second Amendment sanctuary state so you can actually defend your family and your property because your government's not doing a good job. We need these political agendas out of our school system. We gotta look at fire education. We absolutely have to take a look at voting, right, and that, you know, complete and epic failure. There's a problem --Mikaela Lefrak: -- an independent candidate for governor from Bennington. Kevin, thanks for your time.This coverage is part of Vermont Public's Citizens Agenda approach to election coverage. We're asking a simple question: What do you want the candidates to be discussing as they compete for your votes? Front Porch Forum is our lead outreach partner for this project.",

    "content": "Vice President Kamala Harris is vowing to take on \"corporate landlords\" for jacking up rent prices should she win in November. At the same time, executives from the \"biggest corporate landlord\" in the world are boosting her presidential bid with large donations.Harris's joint fundraising committee boasts a war chest with almost $800,000 from top employees at Blackstone, the massive private equity firm facing scrutiny from Senate Democrats for \"extreme rent hikes, illegal eviction, and other predatory practices,\" Federal Election Commission filings show. Jonathan Gray, the president of Blackstone, also donated $413,000 to the Harris Action Fund in late July, according to multiple reports.The large giving is a window into how Wall Street is lining up behind Harris ahead of the 2024 presidential election despite Harris long aiming to position herself as a politician who holds big business accountable. In July, at a campaign rally in Atlanta, the Democratic presidential nominee insisted she \"will take on corporate landlords and cap unfair rent increases.\"2024 ELECTIONS LIVE UPDATES: LATEST NEWS ON THE TRUMP-HARRIS PRESIDENTIAL RACEThe Harris campaign's economic plan, released in August, calls for stopping \"Wall Street investors from buying up and marking up homes in bulk.\"\"Community after community feels taken advantage of by Wall Street investors and distant landlords,\" the Harris economic plan says. \"Vice President Harris is calling on Congress to pass the Stop Predatory Investing Act to curtail these practices by removing key tax benefits for major investors who acquire large numbers of single-family rental homes.\"Harris's willingness to accept the Blackstone-linked donations is \"rank hypocrisy,\" according to Adam Gibbs, the spokesman for the right-leaning Opportunity Solutions Project advocacy group.\"Kamala Harris loves the free market when it comes to receiving campaign cash, but she hates it when it comes to setting sound policy for a nation in the midst of an affordability crisis,\" Gibbs said. \"And she thinks the American people are too gullible to notice.\"As she prepares to face off against Trump, Harris has a cadre of billionaire megadonors in the world of philanthropy, Silicon Valley, and Wall Street fueling her campaign, the Washington Examiner reported. Harris has notably received over $1 million from attorneys at the law firm Paul Weiss, which is favored by Wall Street and Big Tech, federal records show.The Harris campaign also chose the law firm Covington & Burling to help set up its transition team, CNN reported. That firm lobbies for many corporations, including semiconductor manufacturer Qualcomm, according to a report by Donald Shaw in Sludge.To Craig Holman, a lobbyist focused on campaign finance reform, \"special interests\" such as Blackstone are trying to protect themselves from government-led scrutiny in a Harris-Walz administration by giving money to both sides. Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman is a Trump supporter and donates to Republicans.\"It's the nature of our privately financed campaign finance system, special interests trying to curry favor,\" said Holman, who lobbies on ethics issues at the progressive Public Citizen think tank. \"They give her a lot of money, and maybe it will moderate her if she gets elected.\"\nThe Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\"Her hypocrisy on this issue shows she is more concerned with solving her political problems than solving the problems facing middle-class families,\" Gibbs said.",

    "title": "How voting before Election Day became so widespread and so political - The Boston Globe",
    "content": "That number would fall gradually over the next 50 years as states provided Americans with more options on how and when to vote.By 2022, only about half of the electorate voted at the polls on Election Day. The share of people voting before Election Day spiked to more than 70% in 2020, and votes cast by mail surpassed those cast on Election Day for the first time ever. That year, many states enacted emergency measures to temporarily expand vote-by-mail options to protect voters from the spread of COVID-19.\"We've been on an upward trend of early voting over time as more states have adopted early voting options and voters have embraced them,\" said University of Florida political science professor Michael McDonald, who tracks voter turnout and early voting. \"That's resulted in a greater share of early votes being cast each election cycle.\"For most of that time, advance voting was a nonpartisan feature of elections, but a deep chasm formed between the parties on advance voting during and since the 2020 presidential election.Voting before Election Day is much more common today than it was roughly 50 years ago. Yet it is highly politicized as voting in the 2024 presidential election is already underway.Advance voting refers to the range of options that people have to vote before Election Day, whether by mail or in person at an election facility.The term \"early voting\" can refer collectively to all voting that takes place before Election Day. Sometimes it refers explicitly to votes cast in person at local election offices or voting centers before Election Day.To avoid confusion, The Associated Press generally uses terms like \"advance voting\" or \"pre-Election Day voting\" to refer to that broader category and \"early in-person voting\" for the narrower one. \"Absentee voting\" usually refers to ballots cast by mail.Voting before Election Day includes both voting by mail and in-person voting conducted before Election Day.Early in-person voting tends to mimic the experience of voting in person on Election Day, down to the type of voting equipment used and the locations serving as voting centers. The main difference is that the voting is conducted before Election Day. The length of early in-person voting periods varies by state.Mail voting can be further divided into at least two smaller categories: \"no-excuse absentee voting,\" where any voter may request a mail ballot for any reason, and \"excuse-required absentee voting,\" where only voters with a valid excuse as to why they cannot vote in person on Election Day may vote by mail.Requiring an excuse to vote absentee, such as travel or illness, used to be the norm in most states. Today, a shrinking handful of states still require voters to provide an authorized excuse.A third category of mail voting is a hybrid of mail voting and early in-person voting: in-person absentee voting, where a voter submits (and sometimes fills out) a mail ballot in person at an elections office.A small but growing number of states conduct their elections predominantly by mail. Those states, plus a few others and the District of Columbia, automatically send every registered voter a ballot.Variations of absentee voting and voting over multiple days have been part of American elections since the nation's founding. Today's system of mail voting and early in-person voting took root more than a century ago. In 1921, Louisiana paved the way for a formalized early in-person voting system when its constitution specified that \"the Legislature may provide a method by which absentee voting will be permitted other than by mail.\"Voting by mail is even older, but relatively few voters were allowed to take advantage of it as of 1972. Just two years later, Washington became the first state in the nation to allow any voter to request a mail ballot for any reason.By 2005, more than half the states adopted no-excuse absentee voting. Today, only Alabama, Mississippi and New Hampshire provide neither early in-person voting nor no-excuse absentee voting.Yes, but it wasn't always that way.Voting before Election Day steadily grew more popular in both Democratic and Republican-controlled states after 1972. Although there was a partisan split in some states that sometimes varied from election to election, polling from Gallup shows that nationwide there was little partisan divide on advance voting between 2004 and 2016. But the survey showed that voters' plans to use early voting sharply diverged along party lines in the 2020 presidential election.AP's VoteCast survey of the 2020 electorate found a similar result, with additional details on how the choice of voting method divided the electorate. About two-thirds of the votes cast by mail in that election were for Democrat Joe Biden, compared with about one-third for Republican President Donald Trump. In contrast, Trump won about two-thirds of the in-person Election Day vote, compared with about one-third for Biden.When it came to early in-person voting, there was a near-even split, with Trump having only the slightest advantage.Biden overperformed among those casting votes before Election Day, especially among mail-in voters, even in many states that Trump won by a wide margin, VoteCast showed.\"This is just an across-the-board, national phenomenon,\" McDonald said.These patterns continued in the 2022 midterm elections, with Democrats accounting for the bulk of the mail vote, Republicans casting most of the Election Day vote and Republicans holding a small advantage in early in-person voting.McDonald noted that party behavior on pre-Election Day voting was, if anything, the opposite before 2020.\"People who voted by mail tended to be more Republican than the people who voted in-person early,\" he said, but those patterns \"were suddenly turned upside down\" during the pandemic.During the 2020 election, Trump repeatedly disparaged, politicized and undermined mail voting, going as far as to block funding to the U.S. Postal Service to thwart its ability to process mail ballots he claimed without evidence were susceptible to widespread tampering.Trump's messaging on mail balloting has been somewhat inconsistent. At times he has said \"absentee voting\" is \" good. \" But he also has claimed that mail voting is ripe for fraud, something not borne out by decades of mail voting conducted in every state. Trump himself has cast mail ballots on multiple occasions, including in the 2020 primaries.Trump's rhetoric seems to have taken a toll on Republican confidence in mail voting. An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in 2023 found that 58% of Republicans were not very or not at all confident that mail votes would be counted accurately, compared with 32% in 2018. Among Democrats, confidence in the counting of mail ballots increased, from 28% saying they were very or extremely confident in 2018 to 52% in 2023.\"We need to wait and see how 2024 plays out before we make definitive statements about what the early voting is telling us\" about the election, McDonald said.Absentee voting in some states began as early as mid-September, and more than half the states had begun some type of voting by Oct. 1.",

    "content": "Former President Donald Trump is now the betting favorite in all but one swing state just over a week after he surged ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election betting odds.According to online betting platform Polymarket, Trump is leading in Pennsylvania (+9%), Michigan (+6%), Wisconsin (+4%), Georgia (+27%), Arizona (+36%), and North Carolina (+25%). The bettors gave Harris a narrow 1% advantage over Trump in Nevada.Trump is leading Harris in the national odds by a greater margin (+10.8%) than any candidate has led since July, further expanding on his lead over the last week. Current 2024 presidential election betting odds give Trump a 54.9% chance and Harris a 44.1% chance to win.According to Maxim Lott and John Stossel's Election Betting Odds tracker, Republicans are favored to win the Senate by a widening margin, while Democrats are favored to win the House. The GOP has a 56-point advantage in the Senate betting odds, up from 37 points on Oct. 4, while Democrats have a 10.5-point advantage in the House betting odds, down from the 25-point lead they boasted on Oct. 4.Do 2024 election betting odds match the polls?The betting odds agreed with the polls in five of the seven battleground states, as RealClearPolling shows Trump leading in Pennsylvania (+0.3%), Michigan (+0.9%), Georgia (+0.5%), Arizona (+1.1%), and North Carolina (+0.5%).However, polls showed Trump leading in Nevada (+0.2%) while bettors are leaning toward Harris in the Silver State, and polls show Harris leading Trump in Wisconsin (+0.3%) even though bettors are leaning toward Trump in the Badger State.If the November results match the 2024 election betting odds, Trump would win 306 electoral votes while needing just 270 to win the presidency. If the current polls reflect the actual outcome, on the other hand, he would win 302 electoral votes. Both the polls and the odds predict a Trump victory three weeks out.In addition, a newly-inaugurated Trump would have to work with a Democratic-led House and a Republican-led Senate with a 52-48 GOP majority.Bettors only predicted two incumbents would lose in November, giving Montana Republican Tim Sheehy an 80.5% chance to defeat Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT) and Ohio Republican challenger Bernie Moreno a 50.5% chance to beat incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH).The Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania Senate races are the only three others where bettors gave the incumbent party a notable chance to lose. Bettors gave Republican Dave McCormick a 23.4% chance to upset Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA), Republican Mike Rogers a 26.5% chance to beat Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), and Republican Eric Hovde a 23.5% chance of ousting Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI).Featured Local SavingsThe polls and bettors agree on every race except Ohio, as Brown is leading Moreno by 2.6% on average. Otherwise, Casey is leading McCormick by 3.2%, Slotkin is up on Rogers by 2%, Baldwin is leading Hovde by 3%, and Sheehy is leading Tester by 7%.In the national polls, more predictive of the popular vote, Harris leads Trump by an average of 1.7%. This past week, a Harvard/Harris poll had Trump trailing by 2 points, NBC News showed a tie, ABC News/Ipsos had Harris up by 2, CBS News had Harris up by 3, and Rasmussen Reports had Trump up by 2.The key to an 'October surprise'Public appearances have coincided with some of the largest shifts in election betting odds this cycle, and both candidates have major interviews lined up in the final stretch of the campaign.Harris will go on Fox News for the first time to be interviewed Wednesday by Brett Baier in what pundits call a risky move, while Trump confirmed he would go on Joe Rogan's podcast for the first time, despite previously slamming Rogan for supporting former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s third-party campaign. Trump will also be holding a woman-only town hall Wednesday on Fox News.Trump's odds reached their all-time high on July 13, when he survived an assassination attempt at a Butler, Pennsylvania, rally, and after the July 27 debate with President Joe Biden, the president dropped in the odds by 16.6 relative points.The former president lost 5.8 relative points to Harris after his July 31 Chicago interview with the National Association of Black Journalists, and his Sept. 10 presidential debate performance cost him 6.6%, resulting in Harris leading for 26 consecutive days.\nOn Oct. 7, Harris's 60 Minutes interview was released, and she drew criticism for not giving direct answers to critical questions and instead offering a \"word salad.\" Harris dropped 3.4 relative points the day of that interview, and Trump has only gained momentum since then.Trump has led in the presidential election betting odds for nine consecutive days, which is the longest he has led since Harris took her first betting odds lead in August. If there will be any \"October surprise\" to swing the race at the last minute, it may coincide with a notable public appearance.",

    "title": "How Trump and Harris Aim to Address Your Health Care",
    "content": "Health care has largely taken a back seat during the presidential campaign and the lack of focus has left the public wanting more.Two in three Americans (67%) surveyed by Gallup and West Health (Sept. 9-16) say that health care is getting too little focus in the 2024 presidential election. Democrats are more likely (78%) than Republicans (53%) to say health care hasn't received enough attention.That response is likely because the candidates have been light on the details when it comes to most topics concerning health care in America:Both candidates promise to protect Medicare.According to a September poll by Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), the health care-related issues that voters most care about include abortion (7%); Medicare and Social Security (7%) and health care costs, including prescription drug costs (5%).Most of the candidates' proposals would only move forward with support from Congress. NerdWallet spoke with three health care policy experts to get their take on what Trump and Harris have in store for health care.TrumpWhat the experts sayJosh Bivens, chief economist at the Economic Policy Institute: He says Harris' plans seem realistic, especially expanding the insulin cap to more Americans. There's just some question of how her plans could be implemented.Richard Frank, director of the Center on Health Policy at Brookings Institution: Frank says there are two main areas where Harris can improve prescription drug costs. \"The first has to do with clearing out impediments to generic competition,\" he says. \"There are a variety of regulatory and industry strategies that serve to create frictions for generics drugs entering the market. And what that does is it effectively extends the exclusivity period and keeps prices high for prescription drugs that have been on the market for quite a while.\"\"The second part of that, the second competition piece has to do with biosimilars,\" he says. \"And generic drugs apply mostly to what are known as small molecule drugs -- those are drugs that usually come in the form of pills that we've been taking for most of our lives. The other type of drug are biologic products, and they are regulated differently. The Affordable Care Act created a pathway for biosimilars to enter the market and compete that is kind of like what we do for generics, but not exactly. And the regulations have been very slow to develop and they've been what turns out to be excessively cautious. And so what  might do is try to streamline the regulations and to use a sort of pro-competitive policy to try to reinvigorate the biosimilar market and create more competition for biological drugs that have been on the market for quite a while.\"Colleen Grogan, professor and co-director of the Center for Health Administration Studies at the University of Chicago: \"There are now 10 drugs that the federal government is able to negotiate over,\" she says. \"Now it only applies to Medicare, so that impacts the elderly and disabled who who are on Medicare. But Medicare is important because it often sets the stage for private insurance plans to follow and so if Medicare is able to negotiate good prices, then private insurers say, 'Hey, you know, we want those prices, too.' So it often has a broader effect than just Medicare; there is every intention that this is a stepping stone to a broader process of drug price negotiation.\"Grogan adds that it's still an open question whether Republicans in Congress will \nWhat the experts sayBivens: \" really boosted enrollment quite a bit and made it a lot more affordable for many people.\" He says that while Harris would extend or make permanent the ACA premium tax credits, Trump is unlikely to do the same.Frank: He says that making ACA tax credits permanent would bring stability to the marketplaces. Frank adds that negotiating the package of ACA subsidies, as well as the expiring Trump tax provisions, will be a major thread in legislative activity next year. \"My guess is there will be some kind of a grand bargain, in part depending on how the election comes out, that creates a sort of revised constellation of those two sets of provisions on taxes and subsidies,\" he says.Grogan: \"Enrollment in the exchanges has gone way up since  and I think I think they would want to continue with that.\"Trump:Bivens: \"My guess is that it will not be like the same kind of frontal assault on it that there was in 2017, but there will just be a lot of undermining of different provisions of it. I think  is very popular now; in 2017 it was still pretty new and more vulnerable.\"Frank: He says that Trump has no clear alternative plan and he's unsure of the appetite in Congress to take on the messiness and complexities of replacing the ACA.\"I think that the issue is that there are things that can be done to shrink the reach of the Affordable Care Act,\" says Frank. \"And there are things that were done in the last Trump administration to try to make it more difficult to sustain the markets in the Affordable Care Act. But those have largely been restored through various bipartisan legislation over the last few years and those markets are doing quite well. They're insuring more people than they ever have.\"Grogan: She says Trump is unlikely to pursue repealing the ACA and Republicans, in general, know it's not popular. However, she points out that in Project 2025 -- a blueprint for the next Republican president, which was released by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank -- there is a provision that would allow private insurance companies more flexibility around \"essential health benefits.\" She says, \"When you do that, what you're doing is indirectly allowing flexibility on risk rating -- that's not a popular approach.\" She adds that most Americans are happy to move away from preexisting conditions preventing health insurance eligibility or driving up costs of insurance.It's worth noting that Trump has tried to distance himself from Project 2025, but many former Trump administration officials were involved in creating the document.Trump:Bivens: \"The Biden-Harris administration tried to include something pretty big on long-term care in the Build Back Better Act. They had a really big increase on the order of $400 billion over 10 years for home-based health and community-based care services that are paid for through Medicaid, which would have provided a lot of relief for people looking for elder care.\"TrumpWhat the experts sayBivens: He says medical debt is likely to become a bigger political issue moving forward.\"I think it really is bubbling up from people's lived experiences,\" he says, adding \"I think the details will be a little hard to work out, but I think it's a real pressure point that politicians are going to feel like whoever takes a big swing at solving it will get some real rewards.\"Grogan: She says Harris' promise to eliminate medical debt is a viable one. So far, states have funneled funds from the American Rescue Plan to the local level and, ultimately, to hospitals to relieve medical debt.\"What's interesting to me about that is the subsidies are going to the hospitals because the hospitals are the major way in which people are taking out medical debt, and so that's important that people are getting that relief,\" she says. \"I'm a little bit troubled, to be honest, that it's the hospitals getting the subsidy.\"She says there should be regulations that prevent hospitals who receive subsidies from charging exorbitant prices to individuals. \"I'm worried that we're not taking that approach; we're just sort of throwing more money at the hospitals to behave in ways which I think are problematic.\"Reproductive rightsThe September KFF poll showed that most voters (61%) think that this year's election will have a major impact on abortion access in the U.S. The same portion of voters say they support restoring a nationwide right to abortion.HarrisTrumpWhat the experts sayBivens: \"I think  stance is pretty incoherent,\" he says. \"It just shows the incredible cross-pressures of a big part of the Republican base who really would like something like a full ban that's incredibly unpopular amongst the electorate at large. It's just a very hard needle to thread.\"Biven says Trump's position on IVF seems \"half-baked\" as he pulls away from the Republican party's more restrictive stance on IVF. He adds, \"If I see a serious plan on this side, I'd be surprised. But for now, I think he just sort of says what he has to say to get out of a rough couple of minutes of a debate or an interview.\"Grogan: She says Harris is limited in what she can do to protect abortion without support in Congress. Same goes for IVF.Grogan says that Trump doesn't have support from some Republicans in Congress to have insurance or the government pay for IVF. As for Trump's stance on abortion, she says \"It's not clear whether he's saying what he wants to say to get elected.\" She points to Project 2025, again, \"There's really, really conservative stances on reproductive rights in that document and he has dissociated himself with that, but the people around him are supporting it.\" She adds, \"I think people have reason to be wary.\"The opioid crisisLittle has been said about the opioid crisis in terms of concrete actions. Here's what we know.HarrisTrumpWhat the experts sayFrank: \"I think that we have sort of failed to get people into treatment for these conditions that have grown enormously over the last 30 years,\" he says. \"And I think that, you know, our failure to talk about that has been quite notable.\"Future pandemic preparednessBoth candidates have ignored pandemic preparedness during the campaign. From a public policy perspective, it's an odd choice in the wake of a pandemic. Politically, it's unsurprising that both candidates would want to distance themselves from the last health crisis, let alone suggest the possibility of a future one.What the experts sayBivens: He says there's an obvious reason that neither Trump or Harris has focused much on pandemic preparedness. \"I think it's the collective, 'Let's just hope it never happens again,\" he says.Frank: He says the Biden Administration's budget proposed an increase of money for the CDC to support public health infrastructure, including pandemic preparedness. \"I think more or less where you might expect a Harris administration to go,\" Frank says. \"You haven't heard much explicit from Trump, but if you look at proposals in the Congress through the appropriations process coming from the Republican side of the aisle, you'll see a variety of proposals to cut back pretty significantly on the CDC budget. And so I and I think that, you know, I think that that is something to pay attention to now.\"Grogan: \"When you think about the dangers and the need to really think about preparedness, it's odd,\" she says. \"But on the other hand, I think politically, know that it's such a lightning rod, right? I think both candidates just want to avoid it.\"\nThe article How Trump and Harris Aim to Address Your Health Care originally appeared on NerdWallet.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

However, a report suggested that was much ado about nothing.\"They are very good friends and they were so excited to go to the game, but they had different plans as it happens sometimes,\" a source told The Sun of Brittany and Swift. \"...There are absolutely zero tensions between them, they love and respect each other a lot, they were just wanting a different kind of vibe for the first game of the season at home.\"Despite clearing up the rumors, Mahomes still appears to have a message for those coming after her - \"please do not disturb.\"In a new Instagram post, Mahomes shared the message on her sweater. Whether it's a message for her haters or she's just enjoying the team's bye week she certainly looks cozy.As forSwift, she made it clear she plans to vote for Kamala Harris in the upcoming election.\"I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election.

    "content": "Travis Kelce has made it pretty, pretty clear where he stands politically these days.The Kansas City Chiefs three-time Super Bowl-winning tight end is dating iconic music star Taylor Swift. The 34-year-old pop star officially endorsed Kamala Harris and Tim Walz earlier this fall. She has previously spoken out against Donald Trump, so it's not really a big surprise that she went this way for the 2024 presidential election. But still, Swift's endorsement is expected to have an impact on the polls. Swift has 283 million followers on Instagram and is arguably the biggest celebrity in the world at the moment.But where does Swift's boyfriend, Travis Kelce, stand politically?Travis Kelce, who is part of a 5-0 Chiefs team in 2024, has made it pretty clear that he leans to the left, based on his actions and statements over the years.In recent years, Kelce has done some notable left-leaning acts, like:Doing a commercial for the vaccineDoing endorsements for Bud Light, which received criticism from the rightHe has appeared in socially progressive sketches on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\"All the way back in 2017, he become one of the NFL's first white players to kneel for the national anthemThe right sees Kelce as a \"threat.\"\"Travis Kelce, especially if he votes Democratic, profoundly disrupts the right-wing appeal to (white) male identity. In fact, when traditionally successful men like Kelce support liberal and progressive causes and candidates -- especially when they do so openly and unapologetically -- they help to provide a \"permission structure\" for young men to vote for Democrats, including Joe Biden. This could be a nightmare scenario for MAGA well beyond November,\" one outlet argued.Swift, meanwhile, has continued to speak out politically. It's safe to say that she and her boyfriend are probably pretty aligned.\"I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election,\" Swift wrote. \"I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman's right to her own body for decades.\"Not everyone is happy with Swift, though. One country music star accused her of making a \"dangerous\" endorsement.\"If you want to know what regular people are saying about her. I mean she says the reason she endorsed Kamala Harris was a lot because of what Tim Walz was all about,\" Tim Rich said. \"Go look at Minnesota. What they're doing up there, they are going to take kids and take state funds to take kids and underage kids who are confused about whatever and doing permanent damage to their physical bodies that they will never get over.\"And who's Taylor Swift's crowd? Young people. People under the age of 18 who are listening to her say I really likes Tim Walz, maybe I should like Tim Walz. I mean, you talk about dangerous. I mean, she is so dangerous right now to young people pushing what she's pushing because she does have their ear.\"Of course, everyone wants athletes and celebrities to \"stick\" to their professions, unless of course they say something politically they agree with, and in that case, it's always fine.Right?Related: NFL Coach Diagnosed With Cancer At 35 Years Old",

    "content": "Shares of Trump Media & Technology fell and were halted Tuesday during the interview.Former President Donald Trump shared his thoughts on tariffs, a potential breakup of Alphabet Inc GOOG GOOGL, taxes, the Federal Reserve and more during an interview Tuesday at the Economic Club of Chicago, covering several topics that could be key to winning the 2024 presidential election.What Happened: The interview, which was conducted by Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait was tense at times over topics like tariffs.During the interview and shortly after, shares of Trump Media & Technology Group DJT fell and were halted, potentially due to the former president's comments.Shares of Trump Media & Technology fell as low as $25.11 on Tuesday and finished the day down 9.6% at $27.06.The stock rose Monday after the media company announced the launch of the Truth+ streaming platform.Trump on Economy: Trump said his policies will bring back growth to the United States.\"We're all about growth,\" Trump said, as reported by Bloomberg. \"We're going to bring companies back to our country.\"Did You Know?Congress Is Making Huge Investments. Get Tips On What They Bought And Sold Ahead Of The 2024 Election With Our Easy-to-Use ToolTrump on Tariffs: During the interview, Trump argued against the notion that increasing tariffs on foreign goods could negatively impact American jobs, saying higher tariffs could protect \"the companies that we have here and the new companies that will move in.\"\"It's going to have a massive effect, positive effect,\" Trump said. \"The higher the tariff, the more likely it is that the company will come into the United States, and build a factory in the United States so it doesn't have to pay the tariff.\"The comments come as Trump has proposed a 60% tariff on imports from China and 10% on the rest of the world.Trump also said Tuesday that he would block the sale of United States Steel Corporation X to Nippon Steel Corp if he's able.\"I think it sets a horrible tone. There are certain companies you have to have.\"Trump said steel is critical to the country's national security.Trump on Federal Reserve: During the interview, Trump was asked Tuesday about removing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.The former president said if he is reelected, he should be able to give input on if interest rates should change, regardless of who is in charge of the Federal Reserve.\"I think that if you're a very good president with good sense, you should be able to at least talk to him.\"Trump did not confirm whether he would remove Powell but joked about how easy the job is to be Federal Reserve chairman.\"I think it's the greatest job in government. You show up to the office once a month and you say, 'let's flip a coin' and everybody talks about you like you're a God.\"Trump on Breaking Up Google: Another economic topic that came up during the interview was the breakup of big technology companies like Alphabet Inc, the parent company of Google.Trump wouldn't say if he would push to have the company broken up if he returns to the presidency, but he would like to see changes made.\"What you can do without breaking it up is make sure that it's more fair. They do treat me very badly.\"Trump's comments come as the Department of Justice considers breaking up the company over alleged monopolistic practices in the online search sector.Trump on Vladimir Putin: Trump brushed off a question on whether he had remained in contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin since leaving the White House, which comes as a book by Bob Woodward alleges the two have talked since then.\"Well, I don't comment on that, but I will tell you that if I did, it's a smart thing,\" Trump said. \"If I'm friendly with people, if I have a relationship with people, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.\"Trump said his strong relationship with Putin was a positive while he was in office.Trump on 2024 Election: Asked about the 2024 election being a close head-to-head battle with Kamala Harris, Trump said he remains confident in a victory in November.\"Based on the votes that are coming in so far, we're doing very well,\" Trump said.The former president said Pennsylvania and Michigan are two of the top states he's watching for the election as swing states continue to play a pivotal role in deciding the winner.DJT Price Action: Trump Media & Technology shares are up 31% over the last five days. The stock has been increasingly volatile during the 2024 election cycle.Since the company completed its merger with Digital World Acquisition Corporation in March, the stock has often traded with heavy volume or been halted due to key election events like the presidential debates, election polls, and President Joe Biden dropping out of the race. The stock has also been volatile due to legal proceedings involving the former president.Sometimes considered a meme stock, Trump Media & Technology Group has often traded more as a play on backing Trump and his potential election win and less so on fundamentals and valuation of the social media company and assets.Read Next:Donald Trump Can Cash Out His Trump Media & Technology Stock, Keep Company Control: Here's How Many Shares He OwnsPhoto: ShutterstockMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs",

    "content": "Reporters around the USA TODAY Network talk to voters in seven key swing states that could decide the 2024 presidential election.I hate to break this to you, America, but Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are not running for president of the United States.Not all of them, anyway. Not even most of them.In spite of what you may have heard, that's not how elections work here.In America these days, a person hoping to be president of the United States only has to run in seven states.Arizona, where I live, is one of them. The others are Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The other 43 states, where most Americans live, do not matter.News operations call us \"swing states\" or \"battleground states.\" What that means, essentially, is we're states that neither the Republicans nor the Democrats can take for granted.The reason is the Electoral College.In our country's winner-take-all system, the presidential candidate who gets the most votes in a state -- even if just by one vote -- gets all of its electoral votes.States get electors based on population, an ugly vestige from slave days, when James Madison, a slave owner, worked out a \"compromise\" with northern states in which each slave would be counted as three-fifths a person for the purposes of dispersing electors.It was a way to give southern slave states more power in selecting the president.You'd think we'd want to change something born of that shameful past. And we can.We can make presidential elections fairAn organization called National Popular Vote is out to eliminate the Electoral College without tampering with the Constitution.It is working to pass bills in states in which each state's legislature guarantees that the candidate receiving the most popular votes nationwide (not just in their state) gets their electoral votes.The law will take effect only when it is enacted by states with a majority of the electoral votes (270 of 538). So far, it has been passed into law by 17 states and the District of Columbia, accounting for 209 electoral votes (Arizona is not one of them).It needs 61 more votes to go into effect. When that happens, the winner of the popular vote always will become president.Surveys consistently say that the majority of Americans support a popular vote system.Trump hated the Electoral College, then wonIt's ridiculous that millions of Republican voters in, say, California, and millions of Democrats in, say, Texas, have their votes canceled out at the state level because their choice differed from a majority in their state.Under the National Popular Vote, everyone's ballot will matter, and candidates will be forced to pay attention to the interests and desires of voters in every state, not just a few.He was correct. He changed his mind in 2016 when Electoral College votes made him president after he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by almost 2.9 million votes.Roughly half of voters shouldn't be irrelevantAnd that is why states like Arizona and six others get so much attention these days.Trump and JD Vance, along with Harris and Tim Walz, are practically bumping into each other crisscrossing our desert paradise. Not because the candidates like us more, care about us more or believe we're more vital to the nation than all the other states.President Joe Biden beat Donald Trump in Arizona by 11,000 votes out of more than 3.3 million cast and got all 11 of Arizona's electoral votes. He won the national election.We elect every other office holder in the United States by popular vote.But for our most important political office, we operate on a grotesque system originally designed to bolster the influence of slave owners.These days, that twisted arrangement has morphed into a system where, even with universal suffrage, roughly half our voters, and 43 states, are irrelevant.",

Trump argued the government of the United States has \"nasty\" and \"fascist\" leadership, and he was then asked who was really in charge.\"Well, I think it's a committee of people, and they might not even know who the committee is,\" Trump said on Glenn Beck's show on The Blaze. \"They may not even know themselves -- does that make sense? It's a group of people that are in different levels of D.C., and they surround a man that was not the most capable person. By the way, never was, but certainly not anymore. And she's worse than he is. She's worse than he is.\"Trump also warned about the danger Harris would put freedom of religion in if she were to become president, saying being opposed to religion is \"in her bones.\"The former president suggested Biden experienced \"an overthrow\" from office after he dropped his reelection bid, claiming that he is now angry at Harris. He also indicated that the Democrats are trying to \"steer a different path\" when asked why Democrats like former President Bill Clinton were making damaging statements against the vice president.\nPolling data released on Sunday indicated that Trump and Harris are in a dead heat at 48% against a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points. Beck suggested that there could be \"a hidden Trump vote\" among Democratic voters who would break away from their party come Election Day.With only three weeks left before the 2024 presidential election, both Harris and Trump are spending the final days on the campaign trail doing rallies and interviews, with Trump doing a town hall with a women's-only audience airing on Wednesday.

    "title": "'A very deranged idea': JD Vance says it's 'deranged' to not have children due to climate change",
    "content": "J. D. Vance says that it is \"deranged\" and \"bizarre\" to not have children due to climate change or for any political reason.Vance, who was selected as Donald Trump's running mate for the 2024 Presidential Election, is known for his extreme views on children and families. He is among the Republicans and conservatives who harbor disdain for anyone who, for whatever reason, chooses not to have children. Vance has earned criticism for making disparaging remarks about people, especially women, who don't have children, including calling Kamala Harris a \"childless cat lady\" and claiming childless people are \"deranged\" and \"psychotic.\" Recently, he claimed that America is \"pathologically anti-child\" simply because he observed people getting annoyed with misbehaving children in public.His extreme views and fearmongering over people choosing not to have children are concerning. After all, choosing to give birth is a very personal decision. There can be any number of reasons why someone chooses not to have a child, ranging from infertility to health complications to fear or uncertainty about the future. Encouraging hatred and mocking of individuals who choose not to have children without acknowledging the numerous valid, private reasons one may have for not giving birth is extremely dangerous. When confronted with some of his most despicable comments about childless women, Vance claimed he doesn't think everyone who doesn't have children is deranged -- just those who make that decision because of climate change.During an interview with The New York Times, Vance was asked if he truly meant his past comments about how people who choose not to have children are \"deranged, \"psychotic,\" or \"sociopathic.\" In response, he claimed his comments were aimed at people who are concerned about having children due to climate change. According to him, those are the \"childless cat ladies\" he was calling out. He stated:I think you see it sometimes in the political conversation, people saying, well, maybe we shouldn't have kids because of climate change. You know, when I've used this word sociopathic? Like, that, I think, is a very deranged idea: the idea that you shouldn't have a family because of concerns over climate change. Doesn't mean you can't worry about climate change, but in the focus on childless cat ladies, we missed the substance of what I said.The interviewer asked him to clarify if he was, indeed, saying it's \"sociopathic\" if women \"don't have children because they're worried about climate change.\" Vance confirmed this, stating it is \"bizarre\" and a \"really, really crazy way to think about the world.\" While he acknowledged he doesn't think this is Harris' reason for not having children, he still conceded, \"What I would say is that sometimes Kamala Harris, she hasn't quite jumped over the 'You shouldn't have kids because of climate change.' But I think in some of her interviews, she's suggested there's a reasonableness to that perspective.\" Meanwhile, he concluded, \"If your political ideas motivate you to not have children, then that is a bizarre way of looking at the world.\"Vance seemed to think he was reassuring Americans that his comments had been misinterpreted and his stance wasn't too extreme. However, his comments don't offer any reassurance. The correct response to whether he thinks people who don't have children are \"deranged\" should be a resounding \"no.\" Instead, he suggests that whether people who don't have children should be judged or hated depends on their specific reasons. Hence, he's presenting a loophole for right-wing extremists to continue discriminating against, attacking, and name-calling people who don't have children. However, the reason why someone chooses not to have children isn't anyone's business. Women and men who choose not to have children aren't doing anything wrong. This fact doesn't somehow change if the reason for their personal decision is climate change or politics.Also, Vance's comments highlight the biggest issue with pro-lifers, which is that they solely care about bringing people into the world but not about the quality of life of the people they bring into this world. People who choose not to have children because of climate change or for political reasons aren't \"deranged.\" Instead, they are very selfless, thoughtful people who think critically about whether there will be a future for their children to grow up in or whether it will be a good future. Climate change isn't the only uncertainty in the future. In America, conservatives are vying to destroy democracy as we know it with Project 2025 and propel citizens into a nightmarish, dystopian existence. The chances of declining quality of life in the future aren't some unhinged conspiracy theory -- it's a real possibility people must face and make decisions based on.One would think the leaders of America would listen to citizens' concerns about the future and work to find ways to dispel these fears and uncertainties. Instead, Vance thinks it's \"deranged\" to care at all about what kind of future your children will have.",

    "title": "Trump Calls for Using Military Against Left-Leaning \"Enemies\" on Election Day",
    "content": "Trump's calls for military action come as he's made a number of disturbingly authoritarian comments this election cycle.During an interview over the weekend, former President Donald Trump, the GOP nominee for president, said that the National Guard should consider using force against left-leaning people in the U.S., baselessly alleging that the left would disrupt the accuracy of the 2024 election and describing them as \"the enemy from within.\"Trump made the remarks on Fox News's \"Sunday Morning Futures\" program in response to a question about the possibility of foreign influence in the upcoming election. Trump's answer focused on the domestic scene, arguing, without evidence, that a widespread coalition of leftist voters would rig the election against him.\"We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics,\" Trump alleged, not providing any specific names of groups he was referring to. \"And I think it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard or, if really necessary, by the military, because they can't let that happen.\"Trump also said that he didn't believe his own supporters would engage in such actions, despite the fact that hundreds of his loyalists attacked the U.S. Capitol building during the last election cycle in order to disrupt the certification of his election loss to President Joe Biden.There won't be violence \"from the side that votes for Trump,\" the former president claimed.As an ex-president, Trump no longer has any say over how the U.S's military branches are used. However, his statement serves as a warning that he may seek to use military force against his perceived political opponents if he returns to the White House.Trump has not committed to accepting the 2024 election results, saying he will only do so if the outcome is \"honest\" -- likely meaning if he wins. His refusal to accept the results regardless of the outcome has worried a number of political observers, especially in light of his use of authoritarian and fascist language throughout his presidential campaign.Trump has, for example, promised to be a dictator on his first day in office, vowing to relinquish those unprecedented (and unconstitutional) powers after he enacts his racist immigration policies. He has also pledged to use the same legal concepts that were utilized to create Japanese American internment camps during World War II to enact his mass deportation plans, and has called for a single day of police violence across the U.S. to supposedly quell crime.Behind the scenes, Trump appears to be preparing to subvert the results of the 2024 presidential election should he lose to Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris. According to a report from Rolling Stone, which spoke to four sources close to Trump, the former president plans to claim, once again, that the election was \"rigged\" or \"stolen\" from him if Harris is the victor, using the same false claims of fraud in absentee voting that he did four years ago.Earlier this year, Trump had softened his attacks against mail-in voting, but the Republican Party is still engaging in a multi-state effort to make the voting method, generally used more by Democrats than by GOP voters, harder to utilize. Republican-led lawsuits in various states aim to block votes for a variety of trivial reasons, including if absentee ballots are postmarked by Election Day but arrive late, or if votes include small technical errors, such as a voter forgetting to write the date on them.\"The GOP's efforts could, if successful, tip the scales against the Democrats,\" wrote Sasha Abramsky, a freelance journalist and part-time lecturer at the University of California at Davis, in an op-ed for Truthout earlier this month.\"The GOP is throwing spaghetti at the wall with these lawsuits, knowing that most will go nowhere, but hoping that enough will gain traction to cause an unholy mess in at least some swing states.\"",

    "content": "With a margin of error race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump and three weeks to go until Election Day, the two residents of the White House are heading to the biggest of the battlegrounds to campaign on behalf of Harris and down-ballot Democrats.President Biden travels to his native state of Pennsylvania on Tuesday, as he serves as the main attraction at the Philadelphia Democratic City Committee's autumn fundraising dinner.And first lady Jill Biden will be in suburban Philadelphia - as she headlines an afternoon event in Chester County and then speaks in the evening in Montgomery County, where she grew up.The first lady is campaigning on behalf of Harris in the seven key swing states whose razor-thin margins decided her husband's 2020 victory over Trump and will likely determine if Harris or Trump succeed Biden in the White House.Check Out The Latest Fox News Power Rankings In The 2024 ElectionBiden's latest campaign trail foray for fellow Democrats comes amid reports of a lack of coordination between political advisers to the president and the vice president.\nTensions Allegedly Rise Between Biden And Harris AidesThe appearances by both Bidens also come a day after the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees campaigned in Pennsylvania, with Harris holding two events in Erie, in the northwest corner of the state, and Trump in suburban Philadelphia, in the southeastern portion of the commonwealth.It was the vice president's 10th visit to Pennsylvania since replacing Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket in mid-July. Trump's also been a frequent visitor, with rallies in Scranton and Reading less than a week ago.Pennsylvania, along with Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada, had razor-thin margins that decided Biden's 2020 victory over Trump. And the seven states will likely determine whether Harris or Trump wins the 2024 presidential election.But with 19 electoral votes at stake, Pennsylvania's the biggest of the key battlegrounds. And while the campaigns and their allied super PACs are pouring resources into all seven states, more money has been spent running spots in Pennsylvania than any of the other battlegrounds, according to figures from AdImpact, a top national ad tracking firm.Pennsylvania, along with Michigan and Wisconsin, are the three Rust Belt states that make up the Democrats' so-called \"Blue Wall.\"The party reliably won all three states for a quarter-century before Trump narrowly captured them in the 2016 election to win the White House.Four years later, in 2020, Biden carried all three states to put them back in the Democrats' column and defeated Trump.",

We don't like surprises. The best advice I can give is that if we read about it before we hear about it, we're already on the wrong foot.\"Harris said that regulators shouldn't find out about problems in the cryptocurrency industry via the news media but, instead, expect open communication with companies and their legal representatives.Related: New York regulator hunts crypto and AI specialist for policy unitCiting New York's progressive views on cryptocurrency -- relative to US federal regulations -- Harris said cryptocurrency firms should \"come in, talk to us about your five-year business plan.\"Cryptocurrency regulationThe US has seemingly lagged behind Europe and many other jurisdictions when it comes to cryptocurrency regulation.Initially, the 2024 US presidential election appeared as though it could become a referendum on cryptocurrency policy and agenda -- at least for those in the crypto industry. However, both presidential candidates have expressed positive sentiments toward the crypto sector during their campaigns.This has left supporters in the industry divided with some supporting Donald Trump, citing incumbent president Biden's lack of regulatory progress and others in favor of Kamala Harris' seemingly progressive economic platform.As Cointelegraph recently reported, Ripple co-founder and executive chairman Chris Larsen contributed XRP valued at about $1 million to the Harris campaign.",

    "title": "Trump tactics are downright dangerous",
    "content": "Over the past few months, Donald Trump has stoked the flames of white resentment on the campaign trail.Speaking to conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt last week, the former president -- who once referred to himself as a \"gene believer\" and has a known obsession with genetics and bloodlines -- accused migrants coming to the southern border of being \"criminals\" and having \"bad genes.\"It's the latest in a long line of bigoted and xenophobic statements from Trump, ranging from immigrants migrating from \"s -- hole nations\" to supposedly \"poisoning the blood\" of the United States. He and his vice-presidential running mate, JD Vance, lied that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating their neighbors' cats and dogs.The pet-eating rumor, originally circulated by neo-Nazi groups, was part of a litany of stories that Trump has used to incite anger and resentment toward immigrant communities. Springfield has endured bomb threats and had to shut down its City Hall, public schools, and motor vehicles offices. To their credit, several Haitian activist groups have sued Trump and Vance for promoting such alarmingly irresponsible rhetoric about their communities.Vance arrogantly admitted to fabricating the false stories in an effort to garner press attention, further stating \"If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do.\" So much for honesty and integrity.The fact that Trump continues to engage in race-baiting tactics is unsurprising. Recall back to July at the National Association of Black Journalists conference in Chicago, when Trump demeaned Kamala Harris's humanity as a Black woman and argued she was a racial hijacker and deceiver unable to decide whether she is Black or Indian. This is an example of Trump's perverse audacity and arrogance in believing he can decide who the \"real\" and \"legitimate\" Blacks are.Trump's attacks on non-white people are not relegated to Black people. Asian Americans have been periodic targets of the former president's acerbic rhetoric. During the COVID crisis, he referred to the pandemic as the \"Asian Flu\" as an attempt to brew ethnic hostility toward Asian American communities that could potentially position them as targets for violence. That practice of branding migrants as a perpetual \"other\" has reemerged in the 2024 presidential election.Of course, we all remember the \"Mexicans are criminals, rapists, purveyors of violent crime, and some are, in fact, good people\" statement made at the initial moments of his 2015 campaign for president. Let's not forget, he attempted to ban Muslims from entering the United States.Non-Christians have failed to escape his jaundiced, opinionated mindset. Trump has repeatedly described Jewish Americans who do not support him as being \"bad Jews\" who need to \"have their heads examined.\"Trump's acidic rhetoric is seen as a license by his followers to demean and disregard others. He portrays others as existential threats determined to destroy everything his MAGA base admires about the United States. It signals to his supporters that disregarding basic human restraint and destroying perceived enemies \"by any means necessary\" is permissible. Although there are some conservatives who have denounced the tactics of their more extreme brethren, they seem to be isolated voices in the wilderness rather than taken seriously among Republicans as rational voices of reason.",

    "content": "Hunter Biden's attempt to have Patrick Byrne answer questions under oath in a year-old defamation lawsuit in California federal court has been frustrated by the former Overstock CEO and 2020 election denier's recent move to Dubai amid claims of a Venezuelan \"bounty on his head,\" court documents show.A joint statement from Biden and Byrne's attorneys filed last week indicates that the plaintiff and defendant have been unable to agree on where and how Byrne's deposition will occur.Nearly one year ago, before his Delaware felony gun convictions and California tax evasion admissions, Biden filed a defamation suit against Byrne, claiming that the former Overstock CEO defamed him when he falsely accused him of committing \"despicable and treasonous crimes\" involving his father President Joe Biden, bribery, Iran, and the Israel-Hamas war.Byrne, also facing a Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit, was allegedly put on notice that his \"treasonous crimes\" allegations were \"false,\" but he nonetheless \"doubled down\" in a post on Oct. 8, 2023, to link the \"horrific terrorist attacks by Hamas on Israel\" to Hunter Biden's \"purported crimes,\" the complaint said.Biden's lawyers on Oct. 9 told U.S. Magistrate Judge Patrica Donahue that Byrne's insistence on being deposed in-person in the United Arab Emirates or remotely on Zoom poses problems, since there is a \"lack of legal authority authorizing such a deposition to occur in Dubai of a U.S. citizen for use in a U.S. lawsuit.\"Those issues would not exist if the deposition was done in London or Paris, the plaintiff said, but Byrne has \"maintained for nearly a month now that he has moved his permanent residence to Dubai out of fear for his life\" Byrne apparently explained his move to Dubai was due to the belief that American law enforcement can't \"provide me with the safety I need for my personal safety.\"Court documents said that Byrne has no plans to return to the United States at least until after the 2024 presidential election. Why? Because, he says, his life is at risk as a consequence of \"covert activities\" in Venezuela :In this regard, after weeks of discussions regarding the scheduling of Defendant's deposition, counsel for Defendant made written representations to Plaintiff's counsel for the first time on September 11, 2024 that Defendant had moved his permanent residence to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and could not travel to the United States for his deposition because he \"was recently notified by the United States DEA that the Venezuelan government has a $25,000,000 on his head.\" Then, at the September 18, 2024 IDC, defense counsel made the same representations to the Court, this time on the record: \" had been involved in some covert activities in Venezuela, and he was informed by the DEA that there is a $20 million bounty on his head, and he also had been receiving death threats because of that activity.\"After Biden's attorneys said the defense \"did not provide any identifying information or contact information for anyone sufficient to allow Plaintiff to confirm Defendant's claims in this regard,\" they noted that Byrne's team also claimed to have learned \"criminals in West Africa were cooperating to get  in a position where  could be kidnapped.\"For the plaintiff, there are \"no laws or procedures in Dubai which provide clarity as to the legality of conducting a deposition there, either in-person or remotely,\" so the case \"simply cannot proceed\" forward unless this impasse is resolved.Byrne, for his part, asserted there is no issue at all -- if Biden's attorney would just travel to Dubai.\"On October 4, 2024, this court ruled that Defendant resides in Dubai. The defendant has agreed to be deposed in person in Dubai. He has agreed to pay for one of Plaintiff's lawyers and the deposition professionals' travel expenses, accommodation, and travel time to go to Dubai to depose him there but not including the time spent at his deposition,\" the filing said. \"Since Dubai is not a member of the Hague Convention treaty and is not bound by its procedures, Defendant's deposition can be taken right away.\"",

Jonathan Gray, the president of Blackstone, also donated $413,000 to the Harris Action Fund in late July, according to multiple reports.The large giving is a window into how Wall Street is lining up behind Harris ahead of the 2024 presidential election despite Harris long aiming to position herself as a politician who holds big business accountable. In July, at a campaign rally in Atlanta, the Democratic presidential nominee insisted she \"will take on corporate landlords and cap unfair rent increases.\"2024 ELECTIONS LIVE UPDATES: LATEST NEWS ON THE TRUMP-HARRIS PRESIDENTIAL RACEThe Harris campaign's economic plan, released in August, calls for stopping \"Wall Street investors from buying up and marking up homes in bulk.\"\"Community after community feels taken advantage of by Wall Street investors and distant landlords,\" the Harris economic plan says. \"Vice President Harris is calling on Congress to pass the Stop Predatory Investing Act to curtail these practices by removing key tax benefits for major investors who acquire large numbers of single-family rental homes.\"Harris's willingness to accept the Blackstone-linked donations is \"rank hypocrisy,\" according to Adam Gibbs, the spokesman for the right-leaning Opportunity Solutions Project advocacy group.\"Kamala Harris loves the free market when it comes to receiving campaign cash, but she hates it when it comes to setting sound policy for a nation in the midst of an affordability crisis,\" Gibbs said. \"And she thinks the American people are too gullible to notice.\"As she prepares to face off against Trump, Harris has a cadre of billionaire megadonors in the world of philanthropy, Silicon Valley, and Wall Street fueling her campaign, the Washington Examiner reported. Harris has notably received over $1 million from attorneys at the law firm Paul Weiss, which is favored by Wall Street and Big Tech, federal records show.The Harris campaign also chose the law firm Covington & Burling to help set up its transition team, CNN reported. That firm lobbies for many corporations, including semiconductor manufacturer Qualcomm, according to a report by Donald Shaw in Sludge.To Craig Holman, a lobbyist focused on campaign finance reform, \"special interests\" such as Blackstone are trying to protect themselves from government-led scrutiny in a Harris-Walz administration by giving money to both sides. Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman is a Trump supporter and donates to Republicans.\"It's the nature of our privately financed campaign finance system, special interests trying to curry favor,\" said Holman, who lobbies on ethics issues at the progressive Public Citizen think tank. \"They give her a lot of money, and maybe it will moderate her if she gets elected.\"\nThe Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\"Her hypocrisy on this issue shows she is more concerned with solving her political problems than solving the problems facing middle-class families,\" Gibbs said.",

Here's an overview of the top theories.Concert might look a little different: Updated setlist and new costumesThis one might actually be guaranteed.Fans have pointed how Swift introduced new elements to the tour when she started the second leg in Australia, Asia and Europe. From new costumes for different eras to a whole new segment for the \"Tortured Poets Department' album, Swift has been known to shake up things.Speaking of updated setlist, some think 'Florida!!!' won't be addedIn \"Florida!!!\", Swift and Florence Welch offer up a suspense-filled track that highlights the beauty and brutality of the state, with lyrics aimed at escaping, washing away with hurricanes and bodies (metaphorically) sinking away in the swamp.With the news of a potential setlist change, some Swifties have taken it a bit further -- saying the song won't be added to the setlist at all.\"What if she switches the whole TTPD setlist with other songs from the album,\" Raya.Kiza said on TikTok. \"And that's why she sang 'Florida!!!' in London.\"This is one of the more controversial theories, with fans responding that they would be upset if she didn't sing it while in Florida.

She donated $5 million to hurricane relief efforts.Post Malone to Florence Welch: See potential guests namedPivoting back to more positive theories, names have been thrown around for potential surprise guests. During Taylor's stop in Tampa in April 2023, she brought out singer and frequent collaborator Aaron Dessner for two of the three shows.So, will Miami see some familiar faces too?

Specifically, the one she publicly endorsed.It has been speculated that Vice President Kamala Harris will show up during one of the Miami shows, with fans thinking it will be Sunday, Oct. 20.

International attention to protect children in these circumstances is also emphasised.The Independent International Fact-Finding Mission will continue to investigate the situation as requested by the Human Rights Council in a recent decision to extend their mandate for another two years.The Mission was established by the Council in September 2019 to assess alleged human rights violations committed in Venezuela since 2014.It consists of three experts who are not UN staff, receive no payment for their work, and do not represent any government or organization.",

    "title": "Model reveals why debunking election misinformation often doesn't work",
    "content": "When an election result is disputed, people who are skeptical about the outcome may be swayed by figures of authority who come down on one side or the other. Those figures can be independent monitors, political figures, or news organizations. However, these \"debunking\" efforts don't always have the desired effect, and in some cases, they can lead people to cling more tightly to their original position.Neuroscientists and political scientists at MIT and the University of California at Berkeley have now created a computational model that analyzes the factors that help to determine whether debunking efforts will persuade people to change their beliefs about the legitimacy of an election. Their findings suggest that while debunking fails much of the time, it can be successful under the right conditions.For instance, the model showed that successful debunking is more likely if people are less certain of their original beliefs and if they believe the authority is unbiased or strongly motivated by a desire for accuracy. It also helps when an authority comes out in support of a result that goes against a bias they are perceived to hold: for example, Fox News declaring that Joseph R. Biden had won in Arizona in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\"When people see an act of debunking, they treat it as a human action and understand it the way they understand human actions -- that is, as something somebody did for their own reasons,\" says Rebecca Saxe, the John W. Jarve Professor of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, a member of MIT's McGovern Institute for Brain Research, and the senior author of the study. \"We've used a very simple, general model of how people understand other people's actions, and found that that's all you need to describe this complex phenomenon.\"The findings could have implications as the United States prepares for the presidential election taking place on Nov. 5, as they help to reveal the conditions that would be most likely to result in people accepting the election outcome.MIT graduate student Setayesh Radkani is the lead author of the paper, which appears in a special election-themed issue of the journal PNAS Nexus. Marika Landau-Wells, Ph.D., a former MIT postdoc who is now an assistant professor of political science at the University of California at Berkeley, is also an author of the study.Modeling motivationIn their work on election debunking, the MIT team took a novel approach, building on Saxe's extensive work studying the \"theory of mind\" -- how people think about the thoughts and motivations of other people.As part of her Ph.D. thesis, Radkani has been developing a computational model of the cognitive processes that occur when people see others being punished by an authority. Not everyone interprets punitive actions the same way, depending on their previous beliefs about the action and the authority. Some may see the authority as acting legitimately to punish an act that was wrong, while others may see an authority overreaching to issue an unjust punishment.Last year, after participating in an MIT workshop on the topic of polarization in societies, Saxe and Radkani had the idea to apply the model to how people react to an authority attempting to sway their political beliefs. They enlisted Landau-Wells, who received her Ph.D. in political science before working as a postdoc in Saxe's lab, to join their effort, and Landau-Wells suggested applying the model to debunking beliefs regarding the legitimacy of an election result.The computational model created by Radkani is based on Bayesian inference, which allows the model to continually update its predictions of people's beliefs as they receive new information. This approach treats debunking as an action that a person undertakes for his or her own reasons. People who observe the authority's statement then make their own interpretation of why the person said what they did. Based on that interpretation, people may or may not change their own beliefs about the election result.Additionally, the model does not assume that any beliefs are necessarily incorrect or that any group of people is acting irrationally.\"The only assumption that we made is that there are two groups in the society that differ in their perspectives about a topic: One of them thinks that the election was stolen and the other group doesn't,\" Radkani says. \"Other than that, these groups are similar. They share their beliefs about authority -- what the different motives of the authority are and how motivated the authority is by each of those motives.\"The researchers modeled more than 200 different scenarios in which an authority attempts to debunk a belief held by one group regarding the validity of an election outcome.Each time they ran the model, the researchers altered the certainty levels of each group's original beliefs, and they also varied the groups' perceptions of the motivations of the authority. In some cases, groups believed the authority was motivated by promoting accuracy, and in others they did not. The researchers also altered the groups' perceptions of whether the authority was biased toward a particular viewpoint, and how strongly the groups believed in those perceptions.Building consensusIn each scenario, the researchers used the model to predict how each group would respond to a series of five statements made by an authority trying to convince them that the election had been legitimate. The researchers found that in most of the scenarios they looked at, beliefs remained polarized and in some cases became even further polarized. This polarization could also extend to new topics unrelated to the original context of the election, the researchers found.However, under some circumstances, the debunking was successful, and beliefs converged on an accepted outcome. This was more likely to happen when people were initially more uncertain about their original beliefs.\"When people are very, very certain, they become hard to move. So, in essence, a lot of this authority debunking doesn't matter,\" Landau-Wells says. \"However, there are a lot of people who are in this uncertain band. They have doubts, but they don't have firm beliefs. One of the lessons from this paper is that we're in a space where the model says you can affect people's beliefs and move them towards true things.\"Another factor that can lead to belief convergence is if people believe that the authority is unbiased and highly motivated by accuracy. Even more persuasive is when an authority makes a claim that goes against their perceived bias -- for instance, Republican governors stating that elections in their states had been fair even though the Democratic candidate won.As the 2024 presidential election approaches, grassroots efforts have been made to train nonpartisan election observers who can vouch for whether an election was legitimate. These types of organizations may be well-positioned to help sway people who might have doubts about the election's legitimacy, the researchers say.\"They're trying to train people to be independent, unbiased, and committed to the truth of the outcome more than anything else. Those are the types of entities that you want. We want them to succeed in being seen as independent. We want them to succeed in being seen as truthful, because in this space of uncertainty, those are the voices that can move people toward an accurate outcome,\" Landau-Wells says.",

    "content": "Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy posted a six-minute rant on social media in which he blasted Vice President Kamala Harris as \"the worst presidential candidate in the history of American politics.\"\"I am so sick of being gaslighted like she's some great candidate,\" the multi-millionaire said in a video on Sunday.\"Look at the world stage. Afghanistan was a disaster, the Middle East is basically in flames, you got Russia,\" Portnoy said. \"Then on the homeland, inflation's out of control, people burning American flags in the streets...law and order doesn't even seem to matter anymore, you got border, immigration.\"Portnoy - who has an estimated net worth around $150 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth - built his wealth by selling his media company Barstool Sports for $551 million in 2023 and buying it back for just $1 later that year.Barstool started as a Boston-based print publication and has since grown into a social media empire.\"Every once in a while, I get so fed up with politics, I got to do a rant and just let steam off. I try not to, but I've hit the boiling point,\" Portnoy said in his video.\"It's the gaslighting that the left is doing with Kamala Harris, making it sound like she's some great, groundbreaking candidate,\" he said. \"She is the worst candidate to ever run for president ever.\"\"El Presidente,\" as Portnoy calls himself, was a \"big fan\" of former Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley during her presidential run.Since Haley dropped out of the race in March, he has issued his support for former president Donald Trump. Though Portnoy ranted against Harris in his video, he prefaced that he does not like celebrity endorsements.The business mogul argued there are only two kinds of voters in the 2024 presidential election: those that are voting for Trump, and those that \"hate\" Trump and are voting against him.Americans who vote for Harris are \"voting against him  because you hate his guts and you'd vote for a potato or a head of lettuce or anything,\" Portnoy said.One of Portnoy's biggest gripes with Harris is that she is campaigning as a candidate for change.At multiple rallies, Harris has told the crowds that \"it's time to turn the page.\"\"This is the sitting vice president of the United States currently, saying she's the candidate for change,\" Portnoy said.He argued that Harris \"has to\" present herself as a candidate for change because most people agree that the last four years under President Joe Biden were a \"disaster.\"Portnoy also slammed Harris' recent media blitz, including appearances on the \"Call Her Daddy\" podcast, \"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert\" and \"The View.\"\"She's being asked the most simplest questions, softballs that she probably knew were coming,\" he said.For example, he said, Harris has been asked on a few talk shows how her presidency will differ from Biden's.\"She cannot answer it!\" Portnoy exclaimed. \"Kamala Harris can't even answer the easiest questions of all time. She never gives a straight answer. She doesn't seem to be able to put coherent thoughts together.\"",

    "title": "Trump calls for cognitive test for Kamala Harris - BLiTZ",
    "content": "In a heated turn of events in the lead-up to the 2024 US Presidential election, former President Donald Trump has ignited controversy by calling for Vice President Kamala Harris to undergo a cognitive test. The suggestion, which Trump made in a social media post on October 14, comes as the two major candidates have increasingly sparred over their health, raising the stakes in what is becoming a highly personal campaign.Trump's comments came just a day after Harris publicly criticized the Republican nominee for allegedly withholding information about his own health. With the election just weeks away, the debate over physical and mental fitness is emerging as a central point of contention.At 78, Trump himself would become the oldest US president to be inaugurated if he wins the November 5 election. However, rather than addressing concerns about his age and health, Trump redirected the conversation toward Harris. He claimed that recent public appearances by the Vice President suggested that she might not be mentally fit for the role.\"I believe it is very important that Kamala Harris pass a test on Cognitive Stamina and Agility,\" Trump wrote on social media. \"Her actions have led many to believe that there could be something very wrong with her.\" The former president accused Harris of struggling in interviews and even claimed that CBS's *60 Minutes* had altered a recent interview to protect her.According to Trump, CBS edited out a particularly incoherent response from Harris during a recent 60 Minutes segment in which she was asked about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Trump insisted that the original response was a \"word salad\" and that her visible struggle to formulate an answer was later deceptively cut to make her appear more composed.The Trump campaign has also weighed in on this issue, with national press secretary Karoline Leavitt accusing 60 Minutes of deceptive editing. \"During the full interview on Monday evening, the word salad was deceptively edited to lessen Kamala's idiotic response,\" Leavitt told The New York Post.The original response, according to Trump's team, was 22 seconds long, and Harris appeared visibly uncomfortable while speaking. In the edited version, however, her answer was reduced to eight seconds, making her appear more confident and coherent. This alleged manipulation, Trump argues, is further evidence of Harris's unfitness for office and media complicity in shielding her from public scrutiny.Trump's call for a cognitive test is just the latest salvo in a broader debate over the health of both presidential candidates. Over the past several weeks, the issue of transparency has loomed large, with both campaigns taking aim at each other's physical and mental fitness for office.Kamala Harris, who at 59 is significantly younger than Trump, has already released a detailed report on her health. Her physician, Dr. Joshua Simmons, declared in a statement that Harris is in \"excellent health,\" maintaining both the physical and mental stamina required to fulfill her duties as Vice President-and potentially as President.The statement from Dr. Simmons, released after Harris underwent her most recent physical exam in April, described her health as \"unremarkable.\" He also emphasized that she leads an active lifestyle despite the demands of her position, offering reassurances to voters who may be concerned about her fitness for the presidency.Despite this, Trump has continued to question Harris's abilities, citing recent interviews where he claims she appeared \"slow and lethargic.\" He drew a comparison between Harris and President Joe Biden, who has also been the target of Trump's frequent claims of cognitive decline during his time in office.\"We just went through almost four years of that,\" Trump said, referencing his previous critiques of Biden. \"We shouldn't have to do it again.\"The Vice President has not remained silent in the face of Trump's accusations. At a rally in North Carolina on October 13, Harris sharply criticized the former president for failing to be transparent with voters about his own health. She pointed out that, unlike Trump, she had willingly released her medical records and undergone a thorough health assessment.\"Check this out,\" Harris said to her supporters. \"He refuses to release his medical records. I've done it. Every other presidential candidate in the modern era has done it.\"Harris's comments were bolstered by a letter organized by \"Doctors for Harris,\" a group of more than 230 medical professionals who expressed concern over Trump's health. The letter, released on October 13, accused Trump of falling short of the \"standard of fitness for office\" and displaying worrying signs of mental decline. The group emphasized that voters were being forced to assess Trump's health based solely on his public behavior since he has refused to release medical records.\"In the limited opportunities we can examine his behavior, he's providing a deeply concerning snapshot,\" the letter said, calling on the former president to be more transparent about his health.The personal attacks on health and cognitive ability represent an unusual level of scrutiny in a presidential campaign. While age and health have been raised as concerns in past elections, rarely have candidates openly called for their opponents to undergo cognitive testing. Trump's latest statements, combined with Harris's sharp rebukes, suggest that this issue will continue to be a dominant theme in the final weeks of the campaign.For voters, the escalating war of words presents a difficult choice. Both candidates have positioned themselves as the more capable leader, yet each is accusing the other of hiding serious health concerns. With such a tight race, the debate over transparency and fitness for office could sway undecided voters.As election day approaches, it remains to be seen whether Trump's call for a cognitive test for Harris will gain traction or backfire by drawing more attention to his own health. What is clear, however, is that the battle over fitness for office is shaping up to be a defining feature of the 2024 US Presidential election.",

As political beliefs become tied to moral judgments, conversation deteriorates into attacks. This erosion of civility makes it harder to find common ground or reach compromises on important issues.\"When the election is over, what happens to those relationships is impacted by how we handle them now,\" says Dr. Jennifer Brubaker, creator of the website ReframingtheConversation.com and associated podcast series. \"It's important to understand how to communicate with people in our lives, even when we disagree with them about politics.\"Divisions occur when political affiliation is used as a shortcut to judge someone's character.

    "title": "How can Dems govern America when they can't properly govern cities? - Washington Examiner",
    "content": "As Vice President Kamala Harris fumbles her way through the final weeks of the 2024 presidential election campaign, Democratic mayors in big cities are offering the nation a snapshot of the party's ability to govern, and it isn't pretty.From New York City to Chicago, Illinois, and Oakland, California, blatant corruption has taken hold of administrations charged with governing America's largest cities. Chaotic and disastrous governance has made the people of these cities less prosperous and less safe.The highest-profile disaster of a mayoral administration belongs to New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who is facing federal charges that he took bribes and other inappropriate gifts from the government of Turkey. The scandal has embroiled his entire inner circle, prompting several resignations, indictments, and retirements. While not every current or former New York public official who is in hot water is facing legal troubles for the same reasons, the overall picture is one of widespread corruption.The list of those tied up in the bribery investigation is extensive: In addition to Adams, there is also his chief adviser, Ingrid Lewis-Martin, who was served a subpoena; his former campaign fundraiser, Brianna Suggs, whose house was searched by the FBI and had her cellphones seized; Mohamed Bahi, a former Adams aide who has been charged with witness tampering; and Rana Abbasova, an aide fired from her job in City Hall but allegedly cooperating with investigators.Nor is that the whole picture. The scandalous and corrupt governance of the city of New York goes deeper than Adams. In September, New York City Police Department Commissioner Edward Caban, leader of the largest police department in the nation, resigned, and his chief of staff, Raul Pintos, abruptly retired. This came amid a federal investigation that Caban and his brother James may have accepted bribes for favors to nightclubs. No charges have been filed.Other investigations have entangled former NYPD Inspector Dwayne Montgomery, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges; former NYC Buildings Commissioner Eric Ulrich, who is charged with taking bribes; and several others whose homes have been searched and whose phones have been seized. One of those implicated is interim NYPD Commissioner Thomas Donlon.True to stubborn form, Adams has doubled and tripled down on his innocence. He pleaded not guilty to the charges against him, refused to resign his post, and urged New Yorkers to withhold judgment. \"I ask New Yorkers to wait to hear our defense,\" he said.The evidence against Adams is compelling, and his legal troubles have touched off a guessing game about who could challenge him in the Democratic primary next year. Several politicians are expressing interest in the job, including former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and current New York Attorney General Letitia James.Amid the sea of corruption that has plagued him, arguably the only point in Adams's favor is that he was the first and most vocal critic of the Biden administration's open border policies, which flooded New York City with thousands of illegal immigrants and pushed the city's infrastructure to the limit. Whether there is a connection between that criticism and his legal troubles will perhaps be revealed.While Adams has already been in court on public corruption charges, Oakland Mayor Sheng Thao has avoided such a fate for the time being. But an FBI investigation into campaign corruption could soon find her in the same boat as her New York City counterpart.The corruption story in Oakland reads like the plot of a West Coast edition of The Sopranos. The FBI raided Thao's home in June, subpoenaed the city police department in July, and raided the homes of the Duong family, which has close ties to Thao and owns an Oakland waste management company. The investigation purportedly centers on laundering campaign contributions.In the immediate term, Thao has other problems to deal with. On Nov. 5, voters in Oakland will decide whether to recall her from office along with District Attorney Pamela Price, who is facing a backlash from voters for her embrace of a soft-on-crime approach to her job. If Price is recalled, she will be the second Bay Area district attorney recalled in the past three years. In 2022, San Francisco ousted District Attorney Chesa Boudin for refusing to prosecute a large number of crimes.Regardless of whether Thao and Price lose their jobs next month, the tale of Oakland is one of chaos and corruption all too familiar in Democratic-run cities.But one mayor has, for now, managed to sow chaos and corruption without drawing the interest of the FBI. Brandon Johnson is mayor of Chicago because his predecessor, Lori Lightfoot, refused to shy away from a fight with the Chicago Teachers Union and played hardball when it refused to go back to work in January 2022.Infuriated at Lightfoot's refusal to back them, the union backed one of its own, Johnson, in the 2023 mayoral election. Lightfoot was soundly defeated in the first round of voting, and Johnson was elected mayor in a runoff election against centrist Paul Vallas, who ran a campaign focused on public safety.The full picture of Johnson's backroom dealings with his former union came into view as the school board, with which he had publicly feuded, resigned en masse. The resulting vacancies allowed Johnson to appoint a board of allies, who will likely back his efforts to fire Chicago Public Schools CEO Pedro Martinez. Martinez refused to sign off on Johnson's efforts to take out a loan to meet a budget shortfall.The chaos on the school board has unfolded while the CTU is negotiating a new employment agreement with the city. Previous members of the board and Martinez refuse to bow to the union's demands.Johnson has turned the office into a conduit for union rewards. He is not serving the people of Chicago. By all accounts, the new school board will support the ouster of Martinez and will accede to the union's contract demands. It may be legal, but it is corrupt nonetheless.Criminal corruption plaguing Oakland and New York City may not be the type of government that Vice President Kamala Harris would bring if she is elected president of the United States next month, but chaotic governance and \"legal\" corruption in both those cities and in Chicago are probably a harbinger of what a Harris administration will look like.\nThe Democratic Party is begging voters to deliver it control of the White House and Congress, yet in the cities that are the nation's centers of culture and commerce, the party has accomplished nothing but chaos and corruption. At the state level, Democratic governors from New York to California are mired in low approval ratings, maintaining their grip on power only because the leftward lean of their respective states is so extreme that to the voters, the only thing worse than the status quo is a Republican.If the Democratic Party wants to convince the people that it should be trusted with control of the federal government, it should model good governance in the big cities that it governs rather than turning them into case studies of corrupt misfeasance.",

    "content": "Former President Donald Trump is now the betting favorite in all but one swing state just over a week after he surged ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election betting odds.According to online betting platform Polymarket, Trump is leading in Pennsylvania (+9%), Michigan (+6%), Wisconsin (+4%), Georgia (+27%), Arizona (+36%), and North Carolina (+25%). The bettors gave Harris a narrow 1% advantage over Trump in Nevada.Trump is leading Harris in the national odds by a greater margin (+10.8%) than any candidate has led since July, further expanding on his lead over the last week. Current 2024 presidential election betting odds give Trump a 54.9% chance and Harris a 44.1% chance to win.According to Maxim Lott and John Stossel's Election Betting Odds tracker, Republicans are favored to win the Senate by a widening margin, while Democrats are favored to win the House. The GOP has a 56-point advantage in the Senate betting odds, up from 37 points on Oct. 4, while Democrats have a 10.5-point advantage in the House betting odds, down from the 25-point lead they boasted on Oct. 4.The betting odds agreed with the polls in five of the seven battleground states, as RealClearPolling shows Trump leading in Pennsylvania (+0.3%), Michigan (+0.9%), Georgia (+0.5%), Arizona (+1.1%), and North Carolina (+0.5%).However, polls showed Trump leading in Nevada (+0.2%) while bettors are leaning toward Harris in the Silver State, and polls show Harris leading Trump in Wisconsin (+0.3%) even though bettors are leaning toward Trump in the Badger State.If the November results match the 2024 election betting odds, Trump would win 306 electoral votes while needing just 270 to win the presidency. If the current polls reflect the actual outcome, on the other hand, he would win 302 electoral votes. Both the polls and the odds predict a Trump victory four weeks out.In addition, a newly-inaugurated Trump would have to work with a Democratic-led House and a Republican-led Senate with a 52-48 GOP majority.Bettors only predicted two incumbents would lose in November, giving Montana Republican Tim Sheehy an 80.5% chance to defeat Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT) and Ohio Republican challenger Bernie Moreno a 50.5% chance to beat incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH).The Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania Senate races are the only three others where bettors gave the incumbent party a notable chance to lose. Bettors gave Republican Dave McCormick a 23.4% chance to upset Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA), Republican Mike Rogers a 26.5% chance to beat Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), and Republican Eric Hovde a 23.5% chance of ousting Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI).The polls and bettors agree on every race except Ohio, as Brown is leading Moreno by 2.6% on average. Otherwise, Casey is leading McCormick by 3.2%, Slotkin is up on Rogers by 2%, Baldwin is leading Hovde by 3%, and Sheehy is leading Tester by 7%.In the national polls, more predictive of the popular vote, Harris leads Trump by an average of 1.7%. This past week, a Harvard/Harris poll had Trump trailing by 2 points, NBC News showed a tie, ABC News/Ipsos had Harris up by 2, CBS News had Harris up by 3, and Rasmussen Reports had Trump up by 2.Public appearances have coincided with some of the largest shifts in election betting odds this cycle, and both candidates have major interviews lined up in the final stretch of the campaign.Harris will go on Fox News for the first time to be interviewed Wednesday by Brett Baier in what pundits call a risky move, while Trump confirmed he would go on Joe Rogan's podcast for the first time, despite previously slamming Rogan for supporting former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s third-party campaign. Trump will also be holding a woman-only town hall Wednesday on Fox News.Trump's odds reached their all-time high on July 13, when he survived an assassination attempt at a Butler, Pennsylvania, rally, and after the July 27 debate with President Joe Biden, the president dropped in the odds by 16.6 relative points.The former president lost 5.8 relative points to Harris after his July 31 Chicago interview with the National Association of Black Journalists, and his Sept. 10 presidential debate performance cost him 6.6%, resulting in Harris leading for 26 consecutive days.\nOn Oct. 7, Harris's 60 Minutes interview was released, and she drew criticism for not giving direct answers to critical questions and instead offering a \"word salad.\" Harris dropped 3.4 relative points the day of that interview, and Trump has only gained momentum since then.Trump has led in the presidential election betting odds for nine consecutive days, which is the longest he has led since Harris took her first betting odds lead in August. If there will be any \"October surprise\" to swing the race at the last minute, it may coincide with a notable public appearance.",

    "title": "Donald Trump gains the upper hand in the prediction markets -- an indicator more accurate than polls, expert claims",
    "content": "In the words of Yogi Berra, \"it's tough to make predictions, especially about the future.\" But the Dad-joke favored baseball icon was blissfully unaware of crypto.Election day looms, in the spirit of spooky season, like a ghoul or ghost around the corner. But while predicting the future can be a fool's game, Americans are scrambling for any insight regarding what might be one of the closest elections in recent history -- and unprecedented times call for unprecedented sources.For the 2024 presidential election, it might be wise to not just look to the polls, but also check out prediction markets. \"The markets tend to be the single best piece of information available out there,\" Rutgers professor of statistics, Harry Crane, told Fortune.Polls are tight, but Democratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris is pulling slightly ahead of Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump, according to Morning Consult's weekly poll, which cites Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight data. The prediction markets paint a different picture, though, and perhaps a more accurate one, Crane claims.Prediction markets website PredictIt currently places Trump ahead of Harris -- and elsewhere, on the crypto side of the world, Trump is in the lead as well. Polymarket, a cryptocurrency-based prediction marketplace, currently shows Trump ahead in the presidential election by 57.7% to 41.9%. Harris, though, is projected by the same site to win the popular vote by 61.9% to 37.8%.\"Political betting sites are the best at predicting the wisdom of the crowd,\" Thomas Miller, a data scientist at Northwestern University, told Fortune's Shawn Tully. While they don't necessarily have a wider scope, these markets can predict the future better than polls as they have an economic incentive, Crane adds. \"The poll is asking you who you're going to vote for... nobody cares who you're going to vote for. What people care about is who's going to win,\" he said.Having studied the cash markets of PredicIt's accuracy previously, Crane says \"those markets are actually pretty accurate, at least more accurate than polling aggregators at 538 and so on.\" But crypto, surprisingly enough, carries even more weight.Cash prediction markets beat out polls and crypto prediction markets beat out cashCrypto might be drying off in terms of public interest, but it's found a particular niche in the prediction market world. As it stands, slightly more than $1.9 billion in crypto has been traded on the site.Both markets have a \"skewed demographic,\" notes Crane, explaining that they're often male-dominated and many don't even have Americans in them. And not everyone is an active trader, as people often place small bets at one point and do not return. Even so, they carry more weight than polls, he says. Of course, Trump has more favor with those in the crypto sector, which could possibly be tilting the scales in his favor on said site. But as Crane points out, other non-crypto prediction markets like Betfair and Kalshi are mostly in line with Polymarket.\"If I had to pick one market it would be Polymarket to be the closest to the best single estimate,\" said Crane, adding that he tries to take a consensus market price. But just as there is a margin of error in polls, there's a margin of inefficiency in prediction markets, per Crane,According to his calculations, Polymarket has the smallest margin of inefficiency at 1.33% compared to 11.08% for PredictIt. PredictIt has a 10% commission on profitable trades and also some regulations like limiting betting to $850 per trader and 5,000 participants in any given market. \"The markets with higher liquidity, less lower fee structure, and less regulatory restrictions are the ones that tend to be the most accurate,\" Crane said, which leads to Polymarket gaining an edge.While Polymarket hasn't been around or studied for as long as PredictIt, Crane says if you forced him to bet on it, he'd say the former is shaping up to be more accurate this cycle. But that \"doesn't mean Trump's going to win.\" Rather, it's \"a good signal, and a more accurate signal than what I would expect from PredictIt,\" Crane said.Just this past month, prediction markets Kalshi and Interactive Brokers have come online legally in the U.S. These markets, which are restricted to U.S. participants, are less restricted in trading than PredictIt, but still slightly more likely to have a greater margin of inefficiency according to Crane's calculations. In the long-term, though, these markets might edge out Polymarket as it's easier to use and perhaps less alienating than crypto, explains Crane.Foul play might be possible in these prediction markets though, as the New York Times' Dealbook points to large bets in favor of Trump from single users as well as Elon Musk's comments about prediction markets. Acknowledging said allegations, Crane notes there's a difference between someone who is buying a lot of shares of something and someone who is intentionally trying to manipulate the market. In the latter case, the market will often correct themselves. He doubts this is necessarily the case though since other prediction markets and polls have warmed up to Trump in various ways.Who wins is really still \"anyone's guess.\" But crypto might be better at adapting to volatility in such a tight race. Either way, Polymarket is shaping up to be a short-term glimpse into the future. \"Polls are probably going to continue to be in Trump's favor, at least for the next week. And the reason I say that is because the markets are tending to be about a week ahead of the polls,\" adds Crane.",

    "title": "Kamala Harris' Poor Showing among Black Men Reflects Her Tenuous Relationship with Her Jamaican-Born Scholar Father",
    "content": "I have a theory regarding the widely alleged polling deficit being faced by Vice-President Kamala Devi Harris, the 2024 Presidential Nominee of the ruling United States' Democratic Party (DP), among potential African American Male Voters that none of our major leaders, politicians and pundits seems to be either aware of strategically or characteristically all too damn oblivious of or about. And it is the fact that contrary to what former President Barack Hussein Obama would have the rest of us stereotypically believe, has very little to almost absolutely nothing to do with the fact that \"part of\" such palpable and apparent lack of enthusiasm is due to the fact of a remarkable percentage of Black Males \"not feeling that the idea of having a woman as President\" is something that the historically emasculated African American Male Citizen of the United States of America does not seem to envisage as kosher or psycho-culturally normal or a comfortable proposition.Well, according to the very first African American to be elected President of the United States of America, it is this kind of publicly unspoken funk or fear of the Black Woman's Domination of the Black Man that appears to have forced a publicly embarrassed Black Male America, for lack of a better or a more felicitous terminology, \"to be coming up with other alternatives and other reasons to muff up this most unpalatable historical reality\" (See \"Harris Unveils Agenda to Help Black Men 'Get Ahead' as Polls Show Trump Gains\" FOX News 10/14/24).Now, the theory that Yours Truly has is Gender-Related All Right. But it has little to absolutely nothing regarding the general or the visceral and primal discomfort on the part of the stereotypical Black or African American Male for the Corporate or the National Leadership of the Black woman. After all, wasn't the half-Jamaican fathered and half-Indian mothered former Attorney-General from the so-called Blue-State of California the substantive Vice-President of the United States of America over the course of the last four years smack on the Presidential Nomination Ticket of the Democratic Party, with the then former Vice-President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., at the very top of the same, when African American Voters, including an overwhelming majority of Black Male Voters, swamped polling booths all across the country to comfortably and historically put the most unlikely pair of Presidential Candidates into the White House in the November 2016 Presidential Election?Weren't these same Black Male Voters who are now being accused of being so crassly and stereotypically Macho as to feel acute discomfort with a half-Black and a half-Asian/Indian Woman at the very top or apex of the 2024 Presidential Ticket of the Democratic Party, among the same ethno-racial group of bona fide Americans that equally massively voted for Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton, the former First Lady and former United States' Senator from the Empire State of New York to give the former First Lady of the backwoods State of Arkansas - in the memorable words of the late President George Herbert Walker Bush - the landslide electoral margin over then Candidate Donald John Trump in the 2016 Presidential Election?Of course, like former Vice-President Albert Gore, Jr., the former Obama-appointed United States' Secretary-of-State would painfully fail in her epic and most historic odyssey to the White House by the statistical hocus-pocus shenanigans that is the so-called Electoral College, of which many of us are still struggling to make a \"democratic\" sense. For this author, personally, what has made the Presidential Odyssey of the former United States' Senator from the State of California one that is fraught with what might be aptly termed as an avoidable or perhaps a totally unnecessary vulnerability, is the very psychologically and morally obtrusive fact that Ms. Harris has tended to give the sullen and verboten impression that her erudite and professionally distinguished father, Dr. Donald J. Harris, an octogenarian Professor Emeritus of Stanford University, originally from Saint Ann's Bay, Jamaica, the Caribbean, never played any significant or vital and worthwhile parental role in her growing up and upbringing. In short, there are critical signs of a real trauma here.Professor Harris, as this author vividly recalls reading somewhere in cyberspace, waxes wistful anytime that the subject of his evidently bitter divorce from his Tamil-Nadu Biomedical Scientist Wife, the late Dr. Shaymala Gopalan Harris, comes up as a discursive subject. Professor Harris reports having fiercely and strenuously fought for custody of his two daughters, only to painfully lose his battle in the Oakland, California, Family Court System. He keeps this painful experience very close to the vest, although it is quite easy to surmise that battling against an estranged or former spouse who was as impressively educated as Professor Harris himself was not the least bit bound to be a proverbial cakewalk.Still, what may be deemed to be morally redeeming here appears to be the fact that Kamala's father had studiously held his part of the bargain, which implicitly means that he had at least provided the requisite minimum of financial support for his two daughters, the younger of them being Maya Harris. It is also quite certain that the decision that motivated Kamala Harris to attend Howard University and to actively engage in a host of on-campus activities, including being inducted into an African American Sorority, may very well have been seminally informed by her father's influence on her father's life and character formation, even as Ms. Harris personally attests in one of the very few narratives about her implicitly brief relationship bond with her father.Now, my theory, or rather hypothesis, here is that if a perennially parentally marginalized African American Male Community were strategically brought into the picture of her glorious achievements by an equally unreserved celebration of the erudite and distinguished Professor Harris, maybe many African American Male registered, eligible and potential voters would not feel so virulently alienated from both Vice-President Harris morally redeeming and politically resplendent presidential ambition and her national development agenda. Merely cooking up an adhoc socioeconomic development plan or agenda this late into the game or the electoral process, while definitely better than never, is highly unlikely to achieve the maximum desired effect.The preceding notwithstanding, such a remediative or corrective agenda is unquestionably laudable and morally redeeming, even if it also smacks a little bit like an intellectual affront or an expedient afterthought. In all likelihood, Candidate Harris stands to gain far",

    "title": "Trump tells people to vote on 'Jan. 5,' and five other scratching-your-head moments",
    "content": "The Republican presidential nominee has repeatedly made incoherent, false and outlandish statements while on the campaign trail.Former President Donald Trump left voters scratching their heads on Monday after he urged his supporters to show up at the ballot box to cast their votes for him. The only problem is that he got the date wrong.While Election Day is on Nov. 5, Trump thought he had an extra two months to turn out the vote.\"I'll tell you, if everything works out and everybody gets out on Jan. 5 or before,\" Trump told a crowd at a campaign rally in Oaks, Pennsylvania. The Republican presidential nominee went on to falsely claim that \"you can vote two months before, probably three months after.\"Trump's election date blunder came as he bragged about his poll numbers with Black and Hispanic voters being \"through the roof.\"The Harris campaign quickly pounced on Trump's flub, asking on Instagram, \"Does he even know where he is?\"At a rally Sunday in Greenville, North Carolina, Harris said, \"It makes you wonder, why does his staff want him to hide away? Are they afraid that people will see that he is too weak and unstable to lead?\"These types of blunders from Trump aren't a new phenomenon. He has repeatedly made incoherent, false and outlandish statements while on the campaign trail.Here are five other scratching-your-head moments from Trump.1. Calling Americans the \"enemy from within\"During an interview with Fox News on Sunday, Trump railed against the \"radical left lunatics\" and \"bad people,\" calling them \"the enemies from within.\" The former commander-in-chief went as far as to say that they are \"more dangerous\" than enemies in Russia and China.\"These people should be put in jail the way they talk about our judges and our justices,\" he said.The presidential hopeful said the so-called enemies \"should be very easily handled by\" the National Guard or \"if really necessary\" by the U.S. military.This isn't the first time that Trump has signaled that he is willing to use the powers of the presidency to weaponize the National Guard or military in unorthodox and violent ways.He has threatened to send the nation's service men and women to predominantly Black cities like Chicago to address crime.During her rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, on Monday, Harris lambasted Trump's statements, saying, \"He's talking about that he considers anyone who doesn't support him or who will not bend to his will an enemy of our country.\"Harris clarified that Trump has considered a range of people an enemy, including journalists \"whose stories he doesn't like,\" election officials \"who refuse to cheat ... by finding extra votes for him,\" judges who \"insist on following the law.\"She continued, \"This is among the reasons I believe so strongly that a second Trump term would be a huge risk for America -- and dangerous.\"The vice president added, \"Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged.\"2. Calls for \"one really violent day\"Similarly, Donald Trump has called for sanctioning a day of violence at the hands of law enforcement to address crime in the United States.While in Erie, Pennsylvania, Trump suggested policing by force in inner cities across the country would put a stop to crime.\"One rough hour -- and I mean real rough -- the word will get out, and it will end immediately,\" Trump told the crowd of supporters.Though the Trump campaign attempted to clean up the former president's remarks as him simply \"floating it in jest,\" the Republican presidential nominee has a history of floating the idea of using violence on U.S. citizens at his order.During the height of the Black Lives Matter uprising protests in 2020, Trump threatened to sick \"vicious dogs\" on protesters in Washington, D.C.3. Insulting Detroit -- while in DetroitWhile campaigning in Detroit last week, Trump indirectly insulted the city of Detroit while attempting to slam Harris.\"The whole country will be like ... you want to know the truth? It'll be like Detroit,\" Trump said at the Detroit Economic Forum. \"Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she's your president ... We're not going to let her do that to this country. We're not gonna let it happen.\"Trump was promptly slammed for insulting Detroit, particularly because he said it while in Detroit -- a major populous city in the battleground state of Michigan, which he needs to win in November.\"Detroit is a city of innovation and heart. We are survivors and have always fought for what we believe in,\" Marseille Allen, a political consultant from Detroit, previously told theGrio. Allen said of Trump, \"If the man who aligns himself with dictators thinks poorly of my city, the grittiest city in our nation, then we are clearly on the right track.\"She added, \"Keep my city out of your mouth.\"In response to Trump's comment, Harris said, \"Someone who spends full-time attacking great American cities is unfit to be president of the United States.\"4. Accuses Haitians of eating animalsTrump's probably most perplexing comments as a presidential nominee have been his amplifying of lies that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, are eating neighbors' cats and dogs -- a conspiracy and lie first made public by his vice presidential running mate, JD Vance.Trump repeated the lie during his presidential debate against Harris, saying, \"A lot of town don't want to talk about it because they are so embarrassed by it. In Springfield, they're eating the dogs ... they're eating the cats. They're eating the pets of the people that live there.\"As bizarre as the claims are, they have resulted in real consequences for Haitians living in Springfield and beyond, so much so that the immigrant and migrant advocacy group Haitian Bridge Alliance filed a criminal complaint against Trump and Vance.\"It is imperative that we hold them accountable, and we bring them to justice so that they know they cannot continue to terrorize an entire community,\" Guerline Jozef, executive director of Haitian Bridge Alliance, previously told theGrio.Jozef described the pet conspiracy as \"rooted in anti-Black racism and white supremacist ideology.\"5. Trump warns of a \"bloodbath\" if he is not electedHaving already been responsible for instigating a violent white mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, following his decisive defeat to President Joe Biden, Trump warned that there would be a \"bloodbath\" if he again loses in the 2024 election.\"If I don't get elected, it's going to be a bloodbath ... that's the least of it,\" Trump said during a campaign rally in Ohio on March 17.Democratic strategist Joel Payne previously told theGrio that the twice-impeached, four-times-indicted Trump \"uses political violence as a rhetorical weapon\" and has \"done it for a long time.\"In response to his \"bloodbath\" remark, the then-Biden-Harris campaign released a memo detailing what was essentially Trump's greatest hits of encouraging or downplaying violence, including infamously telling white nationalist groups to \"stand back and stand by\" when asked to condemn white supremacy and violence.The campaign noted other incidents -- like when Trump encouraged his supporters to \"knock out\" hecklers disrupting his campaign rallies or declared there was \"blame on both sides\" after white supremacists held a violent rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\"... has spent every moment since his first campaign encouraging and excusing political violence. Repeatedly,\" said Biden-Harris campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika at the time.Concerns about more political violence in the U.S. following Jan. 6 remain as Trump continues to suggest that he will not accept the results of the 2024 presidential election if he loses.The stakes are even higher for Trump as he faces criminal indictments and civil penalties worth half a billion dollars related to fraud and defamation. The former president - who knows the office protects him from prosecution - would likely be shielded from legal harm if elected back into the White House.",

    "title": "How moving trends could make 3 key swing states go red during...",
    "content": "Moving patterns over the past four years could play a role in determining the outcome of the 2024 presidential election, according to a new report from the Realtor.com® economic research team.With just weeks to go before the election pitting Donald Trump against Vice President Kamala Harris, the analysis suggests which states are relatively more popular with red or blue home shoppers, based on Realtor.com online home shopping traffic data from January 2021 through September 2024.The report finds that of the seven key swing states considered competitive in this election cycle, Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina have drawn relatively greater interest from red home shoppers.Meanwhile, Wisconsin and Nevada seem more popular with blue home shoppers.The two remaining swing states, Michigan and Pennsylvania, showed mixed results that didn't indicate a clear trend one way or the other.If the other swing states end up voting along the partisan lines indicated in the report, this could mean that these two states could determine the outcome of the election.The report offers a window into how recent migration trends might affect the election, but it is not a prediction of state-level election outcomes, which will hinge on a myriad of factors, including voter preferences on key issues.\"The influence of migration on election outcomes is a compelling topic of discussion, sparking interest in how shifting populations might reshape the political landscape,\" says Realtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale. \"As more people move across state lines, their voting habits could have the potential to sway election outcomes, especially in crucial swing states, where even small changes in the electorate can tip the scales.\"To assess how recent migration trends might affect the 2024 presidential election, the study combined Realtor.com online home shopping traffic data from January 2021 through September 2024 with 2020 presidential election county-level results.Using those election results, the economic research team determined the likelihood of each online home view being associated with a red, blue, or independent voter.For example, if 60% of voters in the 2020 election favored the Democratic candidate, then the team assumed that 60% of online real estate listing views from that county are from blue shoppers.The study does not account for factors like income, age, or housing preferences that could affect online home shopping behaviors, and assumes the voting preferences of the typical home shopper are proportional to their current county of residence.Based on this assumption, between January 2021 and September 2024, 56.5% of online traffic on Realtor.com came from blue shoppers, 41.7% from red shoppers, and the remaining 1.8% from independent shoppers.The study then compares the relative shares of total out-of-state red and blue shopping traffic received by homes in each state, as well as each state's retention rate of red and blue home shoppers.For example, over the past four years, Wisconsin has received 2.35% of the total out-of-state buyer interest from blue shoppers, more than the 2.23% total share from red shoppers.Wisconsin also retained a higher share of searches from blue shoppers searching within the state (71.52%) than red shoppers (70.7%).As a result of these trends, the report postulates that Wisconsin could shift bluer in 2024. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, won the state by 0.63% in 2020, after Trump won there by 0.77% in 2016.To assess how recent migration trends might affect the 2024 presidential election, the study combined Realtor.com online home shopping traffic data from January 2021 through September 2024 with 2020 presidential election county-level results.Using those election results, the economic research team determined the likelihood of each online home view being associated with a red, blue, or independent voter.For example, if 60% of voters in the 2020 election favored the Democratic candidate, then the team assumed that 60% of online real estate listing views from that county are from blue shoppers.The study does not account for factors like income, age, or housing preferences that could affect online home shopping behaviors, and assumes the voting preferences of the typical home shopper are proportional to their current county of residence.Based on this assumption, between January 2021 and September 2024, 56.5% of online traffic on Realtor.com came from blue shoppers, 41.7% from red shoppers, and the remaining 1.8% from independent shoppers.The study then compares the relative shares of total out-of-state red and blue shopping traffic received by homes in each state, as well as each state's retention rate of red and blue home shoppers.For example, over the past four years, Wisconsin has received 2.35% of the total out-of-state buyer interest from blue shoppers, more than the 2.23% total share from red shoppers.Wisconsin also retained a higher share of searches from blue shoppers searching within the state (71.52%) than red shoppers (70.7%).As a result of these trends, the report postulates that Wisconsin could shift bluer in 2024. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, won the state by 0.63% in 2020, after Trump won there by 0.77% in 2016.Across the country, the study found that migration patterns suggest that 22 states could shift to become more red, while eight states plus Washington, DC, could trend more blue, compared with the last election.Twelve currently red states -- Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming -- could trend redder.Seven blue states -- California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, and Washington -- could also trend redder, the study found.The currently red states that could shift bluer were Alaska, Florida, and Ohio. Meanwhile, four blue strongholds -- Connecticut, Delaware, Washington, DC, and Maine -- could trend even bluer.Twenty states displayed mixed trends that did not suggest a clear shift, according to the study.While a state may shift redder or bluer due to migration patterns, the impact is likely not large enough to switch a state's presidential vote, except possibly in the seven hotly contested swing states.The study finds that both blue and red out-of-state home shoppers showed great interest in homes in the South, a trend probably driven by the region's relatively affordable housing markets and warmer climate.Florida was the top online home search state for both affiliations, with 12.9% of all blue shoppers and 12.8% of all red shoppers.The Sunshine State also had the highest retention rate among blue shoppers, with 76.1% of blue traffic from Florida remaining in-state, compared with 74.4% of red traffic.Among red shoppers, Michigan had the highest retention rate, with 75.56% of red traffic from Michigan remaining in-state, compared with 74.21% of blue traffic.",

    "content": "There are not thousands of immigrants being flown in overnight to Arnold Palmer Regional Airport in Unity, said Gabe Monzo, Westmoreland County Airport Authority executive director.To some chuckles from board members and others in attendance at the authority's board meeting Tuesday, Monzo addressed the nuisance that has become part of his job.\"I just want to dispel that rumor, and do that emphatically, that we are not doing that,\" he said.Spirit Airlines is the sole commercial carrier at the Unity airport, which also is used by private aircraft. Denunzio's Italian Restaurant holds space inside the terminal and private aircraft companies have hangars on the grounds.Monzo doesn't know the source of the rumor, but said he's been getting calls from people in the community inquiring about it, some of which are from police and people involved in politics.\"It's not happening, we have over 100 cameras on this airport,\" he said. \"It's not part of what we do and just please, I'm very serious, we've been getting legitimate calls from legitimate people that are getting these phone calls and it's not happening.\"An Airbus aircraft, the type that Spirit operates, holds about 175 passengers, Monzo estimated.\"(If) five Airbuses come in the middle of the night, I guarantee the people in Lawson Heights would hang me in effigy,\" he said during the board meeting, referring to a nearby community.Airplanes of that size need help from an air traffic control tower, said authority board chairman Donald J. Rossi.\"Our tower hasn't operated at night, or 1 in the morning or 2 in the morning, to clear flights in,\" he said.Monzo encouraged anyone who has evidence of immigrants being flown into the airport to share it so it can be investigated.Immigration has become a hot topic in the 2024 presidential election. If elected, Republican candidate Donald Trump has vowed to stage the largest deportation operation in U.S. history, according to the Associated Press. In a campaign speech, the former president leveled criticism against the Haitian immigrant community in Charleroi.Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris visited the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona during a campaign stop in September. She called for tightening of asylum restrictions while working on a better way to welcome immigrants legally, the Associated Press reported.Hundreds of miles from that border, Monzo is hearing the immigration rumors involving the airport from people from all walks of life.\"It's really frustrating to even consider these issues,\" he said. \"These are just nuisance.\"",

    "content": "Sebastian Stan has branded former U.S. president Donald Trump a hypocrite who has attempted to \"censor\" his new movie, The Apprentice.The Marvel actor spoke at the BFI London Film Festival premiere of Ali Abbasi's movie about Trump's rise to power in 1970s and '80s New York -- in which he stars as the real estate mogul-turned-Republican politician -- with the teachings of mentor Roy Cohn (played by Jeremy Strong) guiding him on his ascension.The cast and crew, including Stan, Strong, Abbasi and screenwriter Gabriel Sherman, appeared on the red carpet at the BFI's Royal Festival Hall in the U.K. capital.When asked whether this film debuting so close to the U.S. election could sway voters, Stan told The Hollywood Reporter: \"I don't know, but what I do hope is that people, regardless of their opinion, are curious enough to try to dig deeper. Because I think we're living in a world where it's so easy to be handed an opinion everywhere you turn. And I know a lot of people love social media, and that's where they go for information and for things. You're being told what to think. You're being told what to do.\"But, the Marvel star continued, \"If you have any inkling of interest, go and really ask yourself: 'Who is this man? Do you really know? Do you really trust this person to lead a country?' He's been trying to censor this movie, and at the same time, he claims that he acknowledges free speech ... I can't think of anything more hypocritical. So at the end of the day, it's about him as a character. Forget the politics and just go in there and use your instinct and ask yourself: Do you trust this man? That's what the movie is about.\"The feature film opened in roughly 1,700 theaters across the U.S. last weekend after its debut in Cannes and pulled in an anemic $1.6 million in its first weekend. Trump lashed out against the film after the numbers came in.\"A FAKE and CLASSLESS Movie written about me, called, The Apprentice (Do they even have the right to use that name without approval?), will hopefully \"bomb.\" It's a cheap, defamatory and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.Sherman told THR: \"It's not surprising ... You've seen the film, the first lesson that Roy Cohn teaches him is: attack, attack, attack. So Trump hasn't seen the movie, but he's clearly following the rules that are in the movie.\"Sherman also said part of the inspiration for this film was to show Trump as carrying on Cohn's legacy, as sources who worked on the 2016 Trump campaign told him the businessman was just \"using Roy's lessons.\"",

    "title": "'A FAKE and CLASSLESS movie': Donald Trump is big mad about 'The Apprentice' | The Mary Sue",
    "content": "The Apprentice is here and Donald Trump isn't loving the new Sebastian Stan movie. The Ali Abbasi film shows the rise of Donald Trump (Stan) and his friendship with Roy Cohn (Jeremy Strong). Trump responded to the film on Truth Social and...well, he's mad about it. Big mad.While the film takes liberties with how Trump and Cohn operated in the 80s, it is still a look into the rise of the monster that is Trump (and Cohn was). However, the man in question clearly did not enjoy it. His post started with \"A FAKE and CLASSLESS Movie written about me, called, The Apprentice (Do they even have the right to use that name without approval?), will hopefully 'bomb.'\"Trump seems to think the movie was a hit job. Honestly, there are aspects of this film that I feel are almost too sympathetic to Trump and then Cohn. The two men, in my eyes, are literal villains of the 80s, New York, and America. So take that as you will.In Trump's post, he went on to say it was a hit job on his political campaign right before the election. \"It's a cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country, 'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!'\"Director Ali Abbasi responded to Trump, posting on X that he could maybe give him a call to chat about the film.In the film, Trump's ex-wife, Ivana, was played by Maria Bakalova. She is painted in a wonderful light but what Trump had a problem with was a scene in which it is insinuated that he sexually assaulted her in their marriage. Stan's take on Trump also cheats on her multiple times and talks about how he is not attracted to her at all.Trump wrote that the two did not have a bad relationship. \"My former wife, Ivana, was a kind and wonderful person, and I had a great relationship with her until the day she died. The writer of this pile of garbage, Gabe Sherman, a lowlife and talentless hack, who has long been widely discredited, knew that, but chose to ignore it. So sad that HUMAN SCUM, like the people involved in this hopefully unsuccessful enterprise, are allowed to say and do whatever they want in order to hurt a Political Movement, which is far bigger than any of us.\"Gabe Sherman is not a talentless hack nor is he widely discredited, as far as I can tell. This is, seemingly, just Trump being angry at how the movie painted him. The reality is that The Apprentice paints Trump in two ways. The first is him as a younger man trying to make his own name and fortune in New York City. After that, we see the \"mogul\" he became and how he lied and cheated his way to the top.Frankly, I don't care what Trump actually thinks about the movie but if The Apprentice made him mad, it clearly struck a chord with him. Hopefully, it also shows others the kind of monster Trump always has been.",

    "content": "Two Republican officials are contesting the voting system ahead of the 2024 presidential election.A lawsuit, filed in a Virginia courtroom, suggests that Republicans may contest the validity of the Virginia election at a later date. In echoes of Republican objections for the 2020 election, one official claims that the voting machines may be secretly hooked up to the internet, which would allow somebody to externally alter the results.In the lawsuit, two Republican appointees to the Waynesboro Electoral Board complained that the voting machines are not verifiable and the voting will not be conducted in the open. Former President Donald Trump beat President Joe Biden by less than 600 votes in Waynesboro in 2020.The lawsuit was filed in Waynesboro Circuit Court by Curtis Lilly, the chairman of the Waynesboro Electoral Board, and Scott Mares, the board's vice chair, against Virginia Department of Elections Commissioner Susan Beals and State Board of Elections Chairman John O'Bannon.The lawsuit states: \"Board members are unable to personally review and verify that the voting machine program being used to count the ballots is keeping a true and accurate count; the voting machine program being used to count the ballots is recording the true and accurate count; and/or that the voting machine record tape accurately represents the ballots cast.\"The plaintiffs believe that the voting machine is counting the votes in secret because neither the program counting the votes recorded on the ballots nor the ballots themselves can be examined.\"Newsweek sought email comment on Tuesday from the Waynesboro Electoral Board and the Virginia Department of Elections.Lilly attached an affidavit in which he explained that he \"cannot ensure that the machines do not connect to the internet, allowing for vote counting algorithm manipulation, nor can I ensure with any certainty that the electronic ballot scanners are presenting results which are consistent with the contents of the ballot box.\"I have taken an oath to uphold the Virginia Constitution, which prohibits the secret canvassing of ballots. As such, I believe that certifying the 2024 election would be a violation of the Virginia Constitution.\"In the 2020 election, Trump and several key allies claimed that voting machines were rigged for Biden across the country. Two voting machine companies have since taken legal action for defamation.In April 2023, Fox News settled a defamation suit with Dominion Voting Systems for $787 million and other cases are pending against former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, businessman Mike Lindell and others.In November 2016, Trump contested the Virginia result while running against Hillary Clinton. In a post-election comment on social media, he wrote that there was \"serious voter fraud\" in Virginia.In response, Waynesboro registrar Lisa Jeffers denied that there were any problems.\"I feel very comfortable and confident that the election was exactly as people wanted to see it turn out,\" she told Virginia's Staunton News Leader.Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, Clinton's running mate, wrote on social media that Trump should not \"insult our voters\" with such claims.",

    "title": "Presidents of the United States: James K Polk, the first 'dark horse' candidate to win the Oval Office",
    "content": "Editor's Note: This profile is part of a series taking a closer look at US presidents ahead of the 2024 presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.James K Polk was one of America's most expansionist presidents.The country grew over 2.5 million square kilometres under Polk's auspices.While he did not coin the term 'Manifest Destiny' - a concept which propagated American expansion across the continent - Polk certainly pursued it with vim and vigour.Polk was born on November 2, 1795, in North Carolina's Mecklenburg County.His parents were Samuel and Jane Knox Polk. Polk's father Samuel was a respected leader of the community, a judge and a businessman. He also owned slaves and moved the family to Tennessee.Polk was a frail, sickly boy. He would later describe himself as \"the meager boy, with pallid cheeks, oppressed and worn with disease.\"Though his ill health during his childhood meant he never had any formal schooling, Polk managed to clear an entrance exam into a university in North Carolina. By the time he graduated, Polk known to be fluent in both mathematics and the Greek classics.He was his class's Latin salutatorian - the student who delivers a Latin oration at a university graduation ceremony.Polk returned to Tennessee in 1818 where he began practicing law.PoliticsIn 1823, at age 27, Polk was elected to the state House of Representatives.It was here that he met 'Old Hickory' Andrew Jackson - of whom he became a friend and devoted follower - so much so that Polk would be renamed 'Young Hickory'He also married Sarah Childress on January 1, 1824, whose social standing as the daughter of a planter would come exceedingly in handy in the political sphere.In 1825, Polk would successfully run for the US House of Representatives as a stalwart Democrat.Polk would spend the next decade and a half in the House - the last few years as Speaker where he used his powers to ban any discussion on slavery.Polk in 1839 left the US House after being elected Governor of Tennessee.Polk as governor worked on banks and education. Though he ran for re-election twice, he lost and returned to Washington.With presidential contenders such as Martin Van Buren, Lewis Cass, and James Buchanan in the fray in 1844, Polk was aiming for the vice-presidential nomination of the Democratic Party.But the Democrats were deadlocked over the annexation of Texas - which had separated from Mexico in 1836.When Martin Van Buren, the presumptive nominee, came out against the platform of annexation, it created an opening for Polk.Now, Jackson, also a fellow believer in \"Manifest Destiny\", threw his support behind 'Young Hickory.'After eight votes produced no result, Polk won after his name was added in the ninth round of balloting.Polk was now officially a 'dark horse' candidate for president - the first in US history.His opponent would be Henry Clay of the Whig Party.The Whigs sought to pounce on Polk's lack of profile outside political circles.\"Who is James K Polk?\" they would ask at every opportunity.The answer came soon enough - Polk defeated Clay and became the next President of the United States.Time in officePolk, the youngest president ever, entered office full of energy.As president, he had several major accomplishments including annexing Texas, successfully concluding a peace treaty with Great Britain and claiming Oregon, conducting a war with Mexico and acquiring California and New Mexico.He also reduced tariffs, set up an independent Federal Treasury and propagated the Monroe Doctrine.Polk, who pledged to serve just one term as president if elected, followed through.By the time he left office, he was thoroughly exhausted and worn down by the burdens of being president.Sadly, Polk died of cholera just months after returning to Tennessee in March 1849.LegacyThere is little doubt that Polk accomplished a great many things during his time in office.The US under Polk grew massively in size and Polk firmly established the powers of the executive.On slavery, the issue of the time that would tear the country apart, Polk in fact publicly called for the practice to be spread into the new territories that joined the union",

    "title": "Could Pennsylvania's Amish voters decide the 2024 election?",
    "content": "Samuel is the national political correspondent for the Deseret News, covering the 2024 presidential election. He writes the \"On the Trail 2024\" newsletter.To Scott Presler, the founder of Early Vote Action, winning Pennsylvania for Donald Trump is a matter of back-of-the-napkin math.\"I'm a data guy,\" the founder of Early Vote Action, a conservative PAC, told me. Trump lost the state in 2020 by just 80,660 votes, a margin of 1%. To win this November, Presler needed to find a demographic group that size or bigger that he could swing toward Trump. How about the state's 80,000 truckers? \"That's the election,\" Presler said. The same could be said for the state's 930,000 hunters, or 800,000 veterans.But Presler isn't focused on any of those groups. He has his eyes on the Amish.On paper, the Amish, in the aggregate, seem like quintessential conservative voters. They value religious liberty and big, strong families. They eschew the influence of government in their lives. They run their own schools and so they appreciate educational freedom. It is no surprise that the three most common Republican last names in the U.S., according to a recent Washington Post analysis, are affiliated with the Amish -- and concentrated in Pennsylvania's Lancaster County. If any group were to deliver solid Republican votes, it is the Amish.The problem? Most Amish don't vote. There is no hard-and-fast rule against it: instruction varies from community to community. To the Amish, the highest priority is building a heavenly kingdom. They attempt to live separate from the world, and that includes worldly governments. No devout Amish person will hold public office. Most devout Amish people, then, tend toward avoiding supporting or opposing those who do.That hasn't stopped attempts to court the Amish vote. George W. Bush toured eastern Pennsylvania's Amish country in 2004 and made a concerted pitch for their vote -- which he got, a record threshold of turnout, about 13%. In both 2016 and 2020, a group called Amish PAC poured $150,000 into signage and mailers, Lancaster Online reported. The local Republican Party apparatus in Lancaster County made a concerted push to lead door-to-door canvassing efforts toward the Amish in 2020, with modest results: nearly 3,000 Amish people voted, per Dr. Steven Nolt, director and senior scholar at the Young Center for Anabaptist and Pietist Studies at Elizabethtown College.But Presler knows 3,000 won't win Pennsylvania for Trump: his vision is getting far more. That's why he moved to Pennsylvania earlier this year.It's an odd match -- Presler, a long-haired, gay conservative, who was at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and reportedly left his prior job with the Virginia Republican Party after a scandal, and the pacifist, pious Amish -- but Presler has quickly assembled an on-the-ground team of employees and volunteers to aid in the effort. Their chief strategy is door-to-door canvassing -- using public records to find Amish homes, knock Amish doors and register would-be Amish voters. If the parents aren't interested, they ask if there are any children turning 18 soon that might be.\"I go in, and I challenge them respectfully, and say, why don't you guys vote?\" Presler told me. Presler's group offers rides to the polls for Amish families; if they prefer absentee ballots, Presler helps them register to vote-by-mail. \"It's actually very ironic, because Republicans are kind of against mail-in voting,\" he said. \"But the Amish, they like a mail-in vote because it's secret and it's private, right? So they love the idea of a secret ballot coming to them that then they just mail, and nobody in their town has to know that they voted. The Amish elder doesn't know how they have voted. Nobody has to know.\"The effort has earned Presler something of celebrity status in Trumpworld. Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara, the Republican National Committee's new co-chair, tried to hire Presler to lead the GOP's \"legal ballot harvesting\" initiative; Presler and Donald Trump Jr. have appeared on podcasts together, fantasizing about winning the Amish vote.The sales pitch is simple, Presler says. Every aspect of Amish living, Presler told me, is \"under attack.\" Overbearing government restriction threatens Amish agriculture, pointing to an Amish farmer near Lancaster whose dairy farm was raided after customers were reportedly sickened by raw milk. The COVID-19 pandemic unearthed conversations about religious liberty, including the ability to gather to worship.But for as much as Trumpworld loves Presler, Presler's hardest task is convincing the Amish -- a humble, devout people -- to love a candidate whose lifestyle exemplifies so much of what they, both culturally and religiously, avoid.Fairview Groceries is no different than most of the other small, family-run Amish stores in the hills surrounding Lancaster. Ephraim King, the store's owner, has made a living selling dry goods and produce, and his shop attracts Amish and \"English\" -- the non-Amish -- alike.When asked if he will vote in this year's election, King chose not to say. \"Voting is not encouraged or discouraged by the church -- it's a personal decision,\" he told me. What is encouraged by the church, however, is \"being honest, truthful and respectful.\" Finding candidates who meet those standards can be a hard sell, King suggested. \"People here say they're voting for the lesser of evils,\" he said.That hasn't stopped candidates from making the pitch. Amish communities in Pennsylvania still tell stories about George M. Leader, the state's Democratic governor in the 1950s, who protected Amish education. Leader was raised on a chicken farm and grew up delivering chicks to nearby Amish people. That affinity led him, as governor, to sign a law allowing Amish teens to be exempt from high school. (Amish schools stop after 8th grade.) Local politicians have earned notoriety for preserving Amish exceptions to Social Security tax, since they do not accept the benefits; and for observing Amish people's pacifist refusal to serve in the armed forces; and amending child labor laws to allow Amish youth to work for their family businesses.\"When we talk about our freedom of religion, freedom of beliefs, one thing is that our goal is to have our children stay on the farm,\" said Amos Miller, who owns a dairy farm in Bird-in-Hand, Pennsylvania. \"That is one of our valuable connections -- being connected to the land. So when we see that is at stake, we do what we can to preserve that.\"The most successful effort to turn out Amish people in a presidential election was 2004, when then-President George W. Bush campaigned through Pennsylvania's Amish country and secured some 13% percent of the Amish vote in Lancaster County, according to an analysis by Nolt, the Elizabethtown College professor. Bush visited the Lancaster area three times in the buildup to the election, and he held at least one private meeting with Amish people. Between the 1990s and early 2000s, only about 5 to 8% of eligible Amish voters turned out in presidential elections; Bush's 13% served as a high-water mark.In 2016, an independent group attempted to replicate Bush's success. Called AmishPAC, the Virginia-based committee pelted eastern Pennsylvania with billboards and newspaper ads, like one large \"VOTE TRUMP' sign that showed an Amish buggy and said, \"Hard Working, Pro-Life, Family Dedicated . . . Just Like YOU.\"But Trump never visited the area, and the ad campaign seemed to fizzle. The print ads were sent out haphazardly in farming periodicals and local mailers, and the billboards were placed on highways, though few Amish people drive their buggies on the highways. \"It was an effort, but it wasn't very specific,\" Nolt, the professor, said. \"It wasn't very targeted.\" Only about 1,019 Amish people cast votes in the county in 2016, out of 15,055 eligible voters, per Nolt's analysis.Come 2020, the local Republican Party organization in Lancaster led a more formal outreach effort. Door-to-door canvassers were sent to register Amish people to vote. A sense of frustration toward perceived government overreach during the COVID-19 pandemic, which limited some church and school gatherings, played well with the Republican pitch.In Ohio, a \"Trump Train Parade,\" featuring Trump flags and Amish buggies, rolled through a rural town. During a rally in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, Trump called out the Amish by name: \"Don't tell anybody, but the Pennsylvania Dutch are voting en masse,\" Trump said. \"They're voting. I heard that the other day.\"When Nolt and his fellow researchers concluded their study of 2020 election turnout, cross-checking Lancaster County voter registration data with Amish church membership directories, they found a big jump in Amish turnout: some 2,940 people voted in the election out of over 4,000 registered, more than double those figures in 2016. Due to the pandemic, Nolt and his team couldn't conduct the traditional face-to-face research that would get at why that jump occurred. Nolt's hypothesis, offered with a shrug, was this: turnout efforts were more targeted, more efficient and better planned than in 2016.If that's true, it bodes well for this election. Republicans in Lancaster County are leading canvassing efforts, while Presler's Early Vote Action army prepares mailers and zig-zags the state with voter registration forms and \"Amish For Trump\" yard signs. Tricia Aulbach, one of Early Vote Action's regional representatives, said she has personally registered nearly 200 people, using a combination of public records and voting lists to identify Amish households and targeting young adults still living at home.\"They want their quality of life preserved,\" she said. \"They want the freedom to do what they want in their life. They want to keep their weapon. They want pro-life (policies). They think that children are a blessing from God. Those are all things that I believe, as well.\" When the election is over, Aulbach said, she plans to spend more time connecting with the Amish people in her community. \"They're our neighbors,\" she said. \"They are so godlike, so kind. It's been life-changing for me.\"As the 2024 election approached, the Trump world found its Amish hero: Amos Miller, the dairy farmer in Bird-in-Hand, Pennsylvania. He has become something of a folk hero for his ongoing fight with the state over his efforts to sell raw dairy goods. In 2016, the FDA discovered traces of listeria in Miller's products; then in early 2024, after years of back-and-forth, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture executed a search warrant at Miller's farm, and blocked him from selling raw milk.On the Trump right, it was a clear example of blatant government overreach. Dozens of demonstrators marched outside the Lancaster County courthouse where Miller's hearing was held. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky, tweeted that Miller was just a \"man growing food\": \"With all of the problems in society today, this is what the government wants to focus on?\"When Presler was invited onstage during Trump's rally in Butler, Pennsylvania this month, he made a pitch directly to Miller and his followers. \"To our beautiful Amish in Lancaster in Pennsylvania and across the state, we will protect your raw milk, your dairy, your farming, your school choice, your religious freedom, your ability to have ten beautiful children per family,\" he said.Miller isn't so sure -- not publicly, at least. When I visited his farm in early October, he declined to say whether he would be voting in this year's election. \"That's a personal choice,\" he said. When asked what he thinks of the candidates, he mentioned only Robert F. Kennedy Jr. by name, the former independent candidate who dropped out and endorsed Trump. \"He respects farm-to-consumer freedom,\" Miller said. \"We're very excited about that. That's always special to have those kinds of endorsements, that they respect our beliefs.\"The biggest issue for Miller, bar none, is agricultural freedom. \"There's a big concern about controlling the food supply, not just amongst the Amish,\" he said. \"There are concerns the farms are too highly regulated. The way it's going now, the government wants to control the food supply.\" Over the last decade, Miller has seen farms in his area shutting down \"left and right,\" he said. \"We know it's an important part of our culture, and we see that at risk, because the rules and regulations are too burdensome.\"Down the road, at a small store attached to her home, Lydia Fisher said she planned to vote. \"We need someone who loves the country, who loves conservative values,\" she said.Her husband, Amos Fisher, shook his head. \"But Trump's character...\"He plans to vote regardless, he said. \"We hope more people would vote,\" he said. \"It's important.\"",

    "title": "New Alignments of Democrats and Republicans Emerge for 2024 Election, Future Uncertain - Internewscast Journal",
    "content": "The Democratic and Republican Parties' coalitions are undergoing a seismic change just weeks before Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump face off against each other.What comes after Election Day is anyone's guess.Harris is over-performing with seniors, sparking speculation she could even win a demographic that has traditionally leaned Republican. Trump, meanwhile, is eating into Democrats' edge with Black and Hispanic voters, particularly males, eroding a gap that has sunk past GOP presidential contenders.The 2024 presidential election therefore marks not just a key race to see who leads the country but also one of the first contests under what could be brand new dynamics for the parties. Gone, at least for now, are the days of Republicans banking on the support older voters -- some of the nation's most reliable ballot punchers -- and Democrats' proclamations that demography is destiny.\"The trend lines are that we can't take voters for granted, neither party can take voters for granted. The coalitions are shifting,\" said Jamal Simmons, a Democratic strategist and former communications director for Harris' vice-presidential office.Poll after poll suggests voter preferences are altering with little time to suss out what the changes mean.A CNN/SSRS poll released last month showed Harris leading Trump 50-46 among voters 65 years old and up. No Democratic presidential contender has carried that group since Al Gore in 2000.Meanwhile, a recent Pew poll showed Trump getting 14% support among Black voters and 38% support among Hispanic voters, compared to 79% and 54% for Harris, respectively. In 2020, President Joe Biden won 87% support from Black voters and 65% support from Latinos.Those numbers are even starker when divided by gender.Biden won 79% support from Black men and 59% support among Hispanic men four years ago. In the pew poll, those numbers dropped to 72% support for Harris from Black men and 53% support for her from Hispanic men.The shifting numbers have the campaigns and outside operatives scrambling to figure out why voter preferences are changing the way they are and how long after Nov. 5 that shift will continue.Strategists in both parties speculated that seniors defecting to Harris are motivated by temperament and healthcare, potentially spooked by the Jan. 6, 2021, riot on Capitol Hill and repeated Democratic attacks that Republicans will go after long-coveted entitlement programs.\"One is, is that Democrats have done a lot for seniors. Thirty-five-dollar insulin, $2,000 cap on prescription drugs, negotiating with Medicare, etc., etc. They have an advantage on voters trust them on Social Security and Medicare more than Republicans. And I think that there's a qualitative thing, which is, I don't think for seniors, Trump is their type of Republican. They don't like his behavior,\" said John Anzalone, a Democratic pollster who conducts surveys for both Harris' campaign and AARP.Black and Latino voters, meanwhile, are thought to be leaning more on economic arguments than racial ones that Democrats had long deployed. Those voters, experts said, defied traditional thinking of voters with uniquely strong cultural concerns and instead taking into account similar concerns as white working-class voters.\"What you're seeing is this transformation of things like race and ethnicity, where Black and brown voters are increasingly becoming more Republican for reasons that are clearly not racial,\" said Mike Madrid, a GOP strategist who studies and writes about Latino voting patterns. \"This peculiar interaction between race, economic class and diplomas or college education...are happening in very unique ways that are reshaping the coalitions.\"\"The Democratic Party is becoming more white, it's becoming less diverse, and where it's concentrating voters is with college-educated white progressives who are much more insulated to the economy and economic shocks and things like inflation and recessions. Those aren't issues for them. What is, is abortion rights, gun control, marriage equality,\" he said.Economic frustrations are thought to be particularly motivating among men, with whom Trump is consolidating support.\"Democrats have to talk about issues that are important to men, which are very often economic issues, particularly around aspirations. Men want to be able to take care of their families, be contributors to society, and have the standing that comes with a good job or a good business,\" Simmons said.Each candidate is putting in work to stem their losses.Trump has boasted of his plan to end taxes on Social Security income, and Harris is waging a full court media blitz to bring Black men back into the fold, appearing on key radio shows and deploying former President Barack Obama to deliver a stern message to those potentially wary of electing a female president.The country will only have to wait mere weeks to see if those efforts will pay off -- for this election. Even the most veteran operatives aren't sure what happens from Nov. 6 onward.Trump has said this will be his last race, and his singular hold on the GOP may not be replicated, meaning the day after he leaves the stage -- whenever that happens -- could mark a watershed political moment.\"I think you're asking the right questions. I just don't have all the right answers,\" GOP pollster Whit Ayres said when asked what comes next. \"I am loathe to try to give a prediction about what a party would look like without a figure that has so dominated the party for the last eight years.\"Some strategists think the dynamics will snap back -- with seniors going back to Republicans and voters of color coming home to the Democratic Party, arguing that the unique personalities in this year's race are driving the movement, as seen by more traditional trends playing out in some down-ballot races.\"If he goes away, if we beat him, I think that this whole thing starts lining back up long as you have a strong Democratic nominee,\" said Democratic strategist Chuck Rocha. \"I don't see all the opportunities once Donald Trump is gone, because the Donald Trump phenomenon is only happening with Donald Trump.\"\"I think Trump is seen as better on the economy among a subset of younger voters than most Republicans. So, I think it will be challenging for Republicans writ large to mimic that success,\" added a source familiar with the Harris campaign's thinking.Others disagreed, noting that the trends that are producing the changes, such as a rise in populism, were bubbling up prior to Trump and will outlive his political career.\"I don't think Trump is the driver of this,\" Madrid said. \"These dynamics began before him.\"I don't think it's as clear as to say one group is going to benefit over the other. I think what we're seeing is the movement of all these pieces away from a right-left spectrum to a top-down spectrum,\" he added.Still others predicted a whole new ballgame.Trump has undoubtedly altered America's politics, and, as seen by the failures of some of his primary rivals, his personal brand is difficult to replicate -- meaning without him on a ticket, the country might simply be staring into the political unknown.\"Floodgates open up for there to be competition among subgroups. I absolutely believe that. I think all bets are off. And it just depends on who the candidates are on both sides,\" Anzalone said. \"There may be no snapping back.\"",

    "content": "A Georgia judge ruled on Tuesday that state election boards must certify results on schedule in a blow to former President Trump, a decision that came out on the same day as early voting started in the crucial battleground state.Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ordered supporters of Trump who control county or state election boards that they cannot withhold certification or hold back results from certain areas if they suspect fraud or want to conduct their own investigations into the tallies.\"No election superintendent (or member of a board of elections and registration) may refuse to certify or abstain from certifying election results under any circumstance,\" McBurney wrote in his ruling. \"Any delay in receiving such information is not a basis for refusing to certify the election results or abstaining from doing so.\"Georgia law says county election superintendents, which are multimember boards in most counties, \"shall\" certify election results by 5 p.m. on the Monday after an election -- or the Tuesday if Monday is a holiday as it is this year with Veterans Day.Julie Adams, a Republican member of the Fulton County election board, had asked the judge to declare that her duties as an election board member were discretionary and that she is entitled to \"full access\" to \"election materials.\"That was widely seen as a asking for a potential green light to an open-ended partisan process that could delay or derail certification indefinitely, potentially casting doubt on the results in the closely matched Peach State.Adams' failed suit, backed by the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute, argued that county election board members have the discretion to reject certification. In court earlier this month, her lawyers also argued that county election officials could certify results without including ballots that they believe have problems, a move that could open the door to disenfranchising entire precincts or even municipalities.McBurney wrote that nothing in Georgia law gives county election officials the authority to determine that fraud has occurred or what should be done about it.The decision coincidentally came out on the same day as Georgia voters started casting ballots during in-person early voting.Gabe Sterling, Georgia's chief election officer, said more than 122,000 people had already voted before noon and predicted the tally statewide would eclipse the all-time first day record of about 136,000 in the 2020 election held during the COVID-19 pandemic.More than 5,1 million voters have already cast ballots nationwide. Many non-partisan analysts expect turnout in the 2024 presidential election to be somewhat lower than the 2020 race that Biden won by about 7 million votes over Trump.Trump lost Georgia by a razor-thin margin of just over 10,000 votes. He sought to overturn that loss by bullying Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger into \"finding\" enough votes for him to win.",

Trump's also been a frequent visitor, with rallies in Scranton and Reading less than a week ago.Pennsylvania, along with Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada, had razor-thin margins that decided Biden's 2020 victory over Trump. And the seven states will likely determine whether Harris or Trump wins the 2024 presidential election.\nBut with 19 electoral votes at stake, Pennsylvania's the biggest of the key battlegrounds. And while the campaigns and their allied super PACs are pouring resources into all seven states, more money has been spent running spots in Pennsylvania than any of the other battlegrounds, according to figures from AdImpact, a top national ad tracking firm.Pennsylvania, along with Michigan and Wisconsin, are the three Rust Belt states that make up the Democrats' so-called \"Blue Wall.\"The party reliably won all three states for a quarter-century before Trump narrowly captured them in the 2016 election to win the White House.Four years later, in 2020, Biden carried all three states to put them back in the Democrats' column and defeated Trump.",

    "content": "A Georgia judge issued a declaration on Tuesday that the 2024 presidential election result must be certified by an \"immovable deadline\" of Nov. 12 after two recent rules passed by the state Board of Elections were challenged by Democrats.Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ruled that the Georgia election results must be certified by a Nov. 12 deadline, one week after the Nov. 5 Election Day. The Georgia Democratic Party and the Democratic National Committee challenged two recent rule changes by state election officials that they warned could lead to delays in the certification of the results and to chaos.At issue was a rule that would give Georgia county officials the discretion to conduct a \"reasonable inquiry\" of ballots before certifying the results. The second rule passed by the state's election board permits election officials to examine all election-related documentation before certification. Both were passed by 3-2 votes, with Republican members of the election board in the majority.\"To be clear, there are no limits placed on this investigation (other than, of course, the immovable deadline for certification, discussed below). Thus, within a mandatory ministerial task -- thou shalt certify! -- there are discretionary subtasks. The freedom allowed with the subtasks does not convert the overarching fixed obligation into a discretionary role,\" McBurney wrote in an 11-page decision.The judge's decision made no clear mention of either rule but made a firm declaration that no delays to the hard deadline to certify results may occur.The declaration from the judge came on the first day of early voting in the Peach State, and it came 15 days after the judge heard arguments over the dispute at a trial.During an Oct. 1 trial over the pair of rules, McBurney signaled a degree of skepticism toward Democratic plaintiffs' arguments that these rules would obstruct the certification process.McBurney asked attorneys from both parties if they agreed that the certification of election results must be done by a Nov. 12 deadline, and parties agreed to that stipulation.\"What we're debating about is what  can do in the period leading up to certification, and whether we call that work ministerial or discretionary,\" McBurney said.Featured Local SavingsHowever, McBurney's decision could sow doubt about the measures that the Georgia State Board of Elections passed as a means for election integrity. The rules at this point are effectively symbolic in that they provide no pathway to postpone certification of the election results in the event that some county officials may find issue with the ballots.Former President Donald Trump, who raised doubts about President Joe Biden's 2020 victory in the state, has praised board members Janice Johnston, Janelle King, and Rick Jeffares for pushing rule changes aimed at promoting \"honesty, transparency, and victory.\"It's unclear at this time whether the board will seek review from an appeals court over the judge's decision on Tuesday.Gabriel Sterling, a Republican chief operating officer for the Georgia secretary of state, called the judge's declaration \"great news!\"\"The judge ruled that county election board members in Georgia MUST certify elections. Another step in keeping guardrails in place to safeguard our elections,\" Sterling said.\nA separate lawsuit is still pending over an additional rule change made by the state elections board, which includes a provision that would allow county officials to hand-count ballots the night of the election in addition to the required machine count.The Washington Examiner contacted a representative for the board.",

What interests her about hearing the student's perspective comes in part with only talking to voters while following the campaign trail. The other part comes from the controversy in what's reported this election.\"There's a lot of disinformation being spread,\" Godfrey said. \"There are some important issues at stake in this election and some important stories that journalists need to be telling.\"Godfrey strives to do this in her work and tell the stories that may get missed amidst the storm of election coverage.

This allows MSU students to have a chance to become involved in this research and learn about voters as the election approaches.Chinni worries about students' perspective on politics.

    "content": "After-hours movers: PENN Entertainment, Scholar Rock, and moreWILMINGTON, N.C., Oct. 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- With the 2024 presidential election now only weeks away, tensions are high and civil discourse is at an all-time low. This societal problem has reached many families, and relationships find themselves strained or divided due to political differences. A non-partisan website and podcast series, Reframing the Conversation, hosted by a Communication Studies professor from North Carolina, might have some answers.\"The biggest shift in today's politics is the move from politics being seen as an area of policy disagreement to a battleground of moral and ethical superiority,\" says Brubaker. \"The intensity of modern political discourse has made it harder for people to separate their political beliefs from their personal identity and to separate other's political beliefs from their personal identities, which has led to more emotionally charged conversations.\"Many people feel that they've lost loved ones to an atmosphere of hatred, hostility, and judgment that characterizes much of today's political communication. As political beliefs become tied to moral judgments, conversation deteriorates into attacks. This erosion of civility makes it harder to find common ground or reach compromises on important issues.\"When the election is over, what happens to those relationships is impacted by how we handle them now,\" says Dr. Jennifer Brubaker, creator of the website ReframingtheConversation.com and associated podcast series. \"It's important to understand how to communicate with people in our lives, even when we disagree with them about politics.\"Divisions occur when political affiliation is used as a shortcut to judge someone's character. Overall, there's been a decline in civility because of this type of identity-based politics. Instead, by communicating thoughtfully and using certain techniques, many relationships can be saved.Brubaker's website and series provides help to guide people as they try to understand their own political beliefs, their family members' beliefs, the importance of being media literate, and clear tips on how to communicate about politics in a healthy and constructive way. Brubaker also gives help to people looking to repair damaged relationships.\"We are living in a society of political absolutism, but the reality is, we're much more similar than different in what we want,\" says Brubaker. \"But the only way out of this is through civil political discourse that promotes understanding, and collaboration, and solutions.\"A professor of Communication Studies at the University of North Carolina Wilmington since 2006, Dr. Brubaker is a public scholar in political and family communication. Seeing this struggle in relationships and this overlap of her areas of expertise, Brubaker set out to educate the public about why it is important for us to reframe the conversation about politics, how and why people have their political views, as well as how you can protect and repair relationships that are impacted by political differences.Listen to Dr. Brubaker's special six-part series \"Reframing the Conversation,\" produced as a part of her podcast, \"Reframing Me,\" at ReframingtheConversation.com or anywhere you listen to podcasts.Media inquiries may contact Dr. Jennifer Brubaker (910-789-3525, jen@reframing-me.com or brubakerj@uncw.edu) For more information, please visit us on Facebook at Reframing Me, Instagram @reframingtheconversation or visit ReframingtheConversation.com or jenniferbrubaker.comView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/with-the-election-around-the-corner-and-relationships-on-the-line-its-time-to-reframe-the-political-conversation-302276767.html",

The county turned for Trump in 2016. And, in 2020, just 1,319 voters delivered a win for President Joe Biden over Trump, turning the county blue again.This is Harris' seventh visit to the western side of Pennsylvania, according to her campaign.Trump was on the other side of the state Monday night, speaking in Upper Providence Township, 18 miles northwest of Philadelphia.Mail-in voting is already underway in the Keystone State -- one of a handful that will decide who wins the Oval Office. The others include Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina and Wisconsin.Both the Harris and Trump campaigns are blanketing Pennsylvania -- Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, Trump's running mate, stumped in Johnstown Saturday, where in response to a question, he told States Newsroom he considered what happened in January 2021 to be a \"peaceful transfer of power.\"Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, will hold a campaign rally in Pittsburgh Tuesday.Long lines began to snake outside the arena as early as four-and-a-half hours before Harris' Monday rally.A DJ played party music inside as spectators filled the floor and the stands of the roughly 9,000-seat arena.U.S. Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania told the loud crowd, \"Erie, my God, have you showed up.\"\"The national media's here, and you want to know why? Because you pick the next president,\" Fetterman said.\"Erie is the ultimate bellwether county, not just in Pennsylvania, in the nation right now. Right now the nation is all thinking about you and wondering where you're gonna go,\" Fetterman continued, to cheering. \"And we know what you're gonna do, and you're gonna make sure that Harris and Walz is the team that's gonna lead our nation.\"Harris spoke for just under a half hour, highlighting her usual themes of a middle-class upbringing and her vision for an \"opportunity economy.\"She outlined her platform of tax cuts for new parents, first-time home buyers and entrepreneurs, and a policy plan to \"take out corporate price gouging.\"Harris also laid out her plan to expand Medicare to help pay for in-home senior care so \"more seniors can live at home with dignity.\"\"And like so many of my priorities it is born out of a personal experience,\" she said, prefacing the story of how she cared for her mother, who died of colon cancer in 2009.\"But far too many people who want and need to take care of family members -- either you have to leave your job or spend down everything you have to be able to qualify for Medicaid. That's not right.\"\"I will always put middle-class and working families first. I came from the middle class, and I will never forget where I come from,\" Harris said as the crowd broke into chants of \"U.S.A.\"Harris also told the crowd that Trump threatens health insurance for tens of millions of Americans with his platform to overhaul the Affordable Care Act.During the single presidential debate of the election cycle, the former president said he had \"concepts of a plan\" to replace the insurance program that ushered in an era of covered medical care for pre-existing conditions.\"The seriousness of this cannot be overlooked. Think about that, taking us back to a time we all remember when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions, you remember what that was? Well, we are not going back,\" she said, repeating a common rally cry at her events.Harris slammed Trump as an \"unserious man\" with a \"very different plan\" if he wins in November.\"But the consequences of him ever being president again are brutally serious,\" she said.The vice president highlighted the July U.S. Supreme Court opinion that granted former presidents immunity for core constitutional duties, and presumptive immunity for other actions, except for personal ones.\"Now just imagine Donald Trump with no guard rails,\" she said. \"He who has vowed that he would be a dictator on day one, that he would weaponize the Department of Justice against his enemies.\"The Republican National Committee issued a statement ahead of Harris' rally in Erie, attacking her specifically on energy policy.\"The Keystone State will reject another four years of Kamala Harris' dangerously liberal policies because Pennsylvanians trust President Trump to unleash American energy and provide economic relief,\" read a statement from RNC Chairman Michael Whatley.The Trump campaign attacked the vice president on two fronts in its daily press release Monday. The campaign accused her of being on an \"anti-fracking crusade\" and of failing \"to deliver to Black voters.\"Harris earlier Monday unveiled an \"Opportunity Agenda for Black Men\" that would legalize recreational marijuana and introduce a \"regulatory framework for cryptocurrency,\" according to a release from the Harris campaign.",

Vance, based on contract prices from another betting platform,PredictIt. Miller's analysis suggests that the betting markets may be capturing momentum and voter enthusiasm that traditional polls may miss.As the 2024 election approaches, the seven swing states in focus -- Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and Nevada -- are shaping up to be the deciding factor.Each state holds a significant number of electoral votes, and both campaigns are focusing heavily on these areas to secure a win.The shift in Trump's favorability across these key states signals that the race remains highly competitive, with both candidates vying for last-minute support.With Election Day just weeks away, the outcome in these battlegrounds will be critical in determining who wins the presidency in 2024.The opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of LifeZette.

    "title": "Review | Bob Woodward argues that Trump is 'far worse than Richard Nixon'",
    "content": "In his new book, \"War,\" Woodward draws sharp contrasts between the Biden administration's leadership and the dangers presented by Trump.Over the past two weeks, headlines have trumpeted choice bits from Bob Woodward's new book, \"War\": How then President Donald Trump secretly sent Covid test machines to Russian President Vladimir Putin. How Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu drives President Joe Biden to private, invective-fueled rages.News articles frequently call these tasty bits \"nuggets.\" As a publicity strategy, they have worked wonders, turning the book into an event that demands attention. But reducing the book to scoops trivializes Woodward's ambitions for this sprawling, occasionally blinkered but timely book. If the nuggets were the meal, then the headlines would make the book itself redundant.\"War\" does not present a comprehensive view of the battles in Ukraine and the Middle East that partly inspire its title. Instead, this is Woodward's attempt to establish what it means to be worthy of the great responsibility of running a great power. The reporting -- and, yes, the nuggets -- serves as a vehicle for Woodward's judgments about the importance of character and teamwork in producing good government.The book is also about more than foreign policy. The third war encompassed by Woodward's title is the 2024 presidential election. How do three conflicts -- two armed and another at the ballot box -- become one singular \"War?\" What unites them in this book is the struggle between those who seek to wield power for a greater good -- the Biden team, in Woodward's view -- and those who bend power to their own personal ends -- Trump and Putin, especially.Trump's unworthiness to hold office is a central theme, but Biden and his administration mostly occupy central stage. Trump serves as a foil, a negative proof of what could have happened -- and what might happen again.Woodward crafts his tale from a mixture of publicly available sources and his trademark insider interviews. One can probably guess who (or whose aides) spoke to him on deep background by their portrayal. National security adviser Jake Sullivan, his deputy Jon Finer, and Middle East specialist Brett McGurk appear in \"War\" as somewhat harried, somewhat weary, but always sensible advisers supporting the president -- the perfect aides. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin -- the \"star pick\" of Biden's Cabinet, a description attributed to Sullivan -- faces down Russian officials with action-star lines: \"I am the leader of the most powerful military in the history of the world. I don't make threats,\" Woodward quotes Austin saying to the Russian defense minister. (The book's portrayal of Austin as focused and in command contrasts with the public image left by Austin's recent coverup of severe health problems -- unmentioned in the book.) Secretary of State Antony Blinken rarely comes across as less than sagacious and winning in conversations with interlocutors ranging from Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to Middle Eastern leaders to Biden himself.Yet a reader who understands these perspectives can adjust for any slants the sources may seek to provide. And even if most of the sources Woodward spoke to for the book are residents or friends of Bidenworld, he is too good a writer and too experienced an observer to let the book's lessons be dictated by his sources.Woodward constructs contrasting portrayals of how the administration has handled the situations in Ukraine and Israel. In Ukraine, Woodward describes a team at peak tactical performance. The first half of the Ukraine saga reads like a late Tom Clancy novel. Early hopes for a pragmatic accommodation with Russia were undone by Putin's obsession with restoring Russia's glory, and his own, by subjugating Ukraine in a lightning war -- a gambit foiled by adroit maneuvers by American diplomats and intelligence agencies.The Biden team views its subsequent management of the conflict as no less impressive. \"War\" acknowledges the role of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in rallying Ukrainian defenders and Western supporters to help conduct what has become a grinding and grueling campaign, but Woodward primarily focuses on how the Biden team sought to prevent direct U.S. involvement or the risk of a broader confrontation.The keystone of that containment was a crisis in autumn 2022 over the potential use of a Russian nuclear weapon. After U.S. intelligence picked up indications that Putin was considering using a nuclear weapon, Woodward reports, Biden ordered his team to do all that it could do to deter such an action. The main thrust of conveying the gravity of a potential U.S. response fell to Austin and his steady undersecretary Colin Kahl, but those assisting them included, among others, Chinese President Xi Jinping, an ally of Putin. A clear message, directly conveyed, helped persuade the Russians to back away from the brink.With nuclear war as the stakes, the Biden team's evident pride in keeping U.S.-Russian relations from spiraling into direct conflict is justifiable. It is clear they view that moment as the best evidence of their capacity to successfully manage a crisis -- a direct contrast to Trump's proclivity to provoke or escalate crises.Stories like these, however, must be read carefully. For one, claiming credit for deterrence is difficult. Was Putin really deterred or was his consideration of such an extreme strategy a feint? Without access to Russian sources, it is impossible to fully know, but it is important to know the Biden team viewed the crisis, in the president's words, as forcing a choice between giving in to Russian bluster and letting too great a Ukrainian success risk nuclear war.The book also relates that Biden privately ruled out a U.S. nuclear response if a Russian nuclear provocation in Ukraine had occurred, something about which he had been more circumspect publicly. That is a \"nugget\" that strategists in Moscow and Beijing might file away -- but it also suggests that voices like Kahl's within the administration who have previously counseled a diplomatic response in similar scenarios are gaining ground, breaking strategic thinking from static Cold War habits. (As Fred Kaplan reported, war-games in the Obama administration dealing with a similar situation led officials to hypothetically nuke Belarus, an outcome Kahl strongly argued against.)Whereas Woodward depicts Biden's team as producing good results on Ukraine, his sources in the administration seek to be evaluated on effort and intentions in the Middle East. U.S. intelligence, like their Israeli counterparts, was caught off-guard by the Oct. 7 attacks. U.S. officials, from Biden downward, reacted with genuine grief and horror to the atrocities committed by Hamas.As loyal allies, they have provided almost all of what Netanyahu asks, including intelligence and diplomatic as well as military support. At each turn, they also struggled -- sometimes successfully, sometimes not -- to persuade Israeli leaders to calibrate their reaction to the attack. Yet they are careful to note for the record their severe disapproval of what Netanyahu ends up doing with that help.The Biden team's objective in the Middle East, according to Woodward, is much the same as its goal in Eastern Europe: limiting the scope of the conflict by keeping it targeted and not having it boil over into a war with Iran. But even by the time this book went to press, it was clear that the attempt might fail; it is clearly too soon to tell whether a wider Middle Eastern war will be avoided.One might criticize the relative absence of attention in \"War\" to Gazans and Palestinians more generally. Atrocities committed against Israelis receive extensive attention (and the details are genuinely horrific and gut-wrenching), while the terror and toll of the conflict in Gaza are abstracted, intellectualized. The Biden team and the Israeli government are shown to be in constant communication: Netanyahu appears on more pages of the book than Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Austin combined. Palestinian voices are absent. The book's most prominent Arab voices are leaders from other countries, some of whom might be startled to see their political calculations laid so bare. (\"We won't say it,\" Jordan's King Abdullah is quoted during a conversation with Blinken, \"but we support Hamas being defeated and Israel should defeat Hamas.\") Whereas ethical concerns over providing cluster munitions to Ukraine occupy a chapter, similar agonizing over providing U.S. weapons to Israel is hardly apparent -- until Harris publicly expressed those sentiments after becoming the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. If Woodward's descriptions accurately reflect how his sources depict the views of the White House, however, these faults are not his but those of the American political establishment.It is the book's handling of the third conflict -- the presidential election -- that most clearly distinguishes \"War\" from other recent books about U.S. foreign policy and domestic politics.Woodward, of course, is far from ignorant of his own place in history or how his books shape conversations in Washington. And so, like a postmodern novelist, he is both an omniscient narrator and a character in his own book, pulled onstage by his characters. At a reception at the Willard Hotel, for instance, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark A. Milley buttonholes Woodward into a heated conversation in the middle of a crowded room. Milley's comment that Trump is \"a total fascist\" -- \"a fascist to the core!\" -- has been reported, but what might be just as important is his plea: \"You have got to stop him!\" \"By 'you' he meant the press broadly,\" Woodward writes, humbly.But it's impossible for anyone to read that sentence and not recall that Woodward has stopped a president before. This book's prologue is based on a hitherto \"lost\" tape of a 1989 interview with Trump by Woodward and his Watergate partner Carl Bernstein. That a book nominally about unfolding global conflicts begins with a decades-old interview alerts us that Woodward's ambitions are not limited to describing the minutiae of arms procurement for Ukraine (although there's ample details about that, too).From their first meeting to the present day, Woodward painstakingly depicts Trump as fundamentally corrupt, if not legally then morally -- \"the most reckless and impulsive president in American history,\" \"far worse than Richard Nixon.\" Not only does Trump pose a danger to U.S. democracy, Woodward unsubtly hints, he would likely end the Ukraine war on terms favorable to Putin and might give Netanyahu an even freer hand than Biden has. Woodward consistently refocuses on Trump's multiple threats to democracy and peace, even nuclear confrontation, reminding his readers that what's at stake is not merely a policy or momentary partisan battle.There are gaps in Woodward's narrative. The book celebrates the Biden team's handling of Western allies in building a coalition against Russia, but it overlooks how many prominent states in the Global South have stood apart from that coalition. China hardly rates a mention. Economic policy and climate change go largely ignored. But such omissions are tempered by the fact that \"War\" is not meant as a comprehensive guide to the present moment. Introducing these strands would not further the contrast the book seeks to draw between Biden's team and Trump -- between the value of competence and the dangers of a tyrant.In an epilogue, Woodward renders his verdict directly: The Biden national security team may have erred but it put forward a \"genuine good faith\" effort to \"wield the levers of executive power responsibly and in the national interest.\" Its actions will be \"largely studied in history as an example of steady and purposeful leadership.\"Had the summer turned out differently, one could imagine these words serving as an endorsement of Biden's reelection. The bulk of this book was written when it appeared he would be on the ballot. But even if Harris herself plays a peripheral role in Woodward's narrative, he makes plain his belief that she and her team would share a similar commitment to deliberation and careful management.Woodward feels the context of history keenly. He and Bernstein kept the Watergate story alive, ultimately leading to the investigations and prosecutions that drove Nixon from office. But they had already reported much of the story when Nixon trounced George McGovern for reelection in 1972. The public already knew, or could have suspected, what it was getting with a second Nixon term. It chose him regardless.If \"War\" is somewhat didactic, even pedantic, about the value of good policymaking, it is because it thrums with the urgency Woodward must feel of persuading the electorate not to make the same mistake -- or a worse one -- again.Paul Musgrave is an associate professor of government at Georgetown University in Qatar.WarBy Bob WoodwardSimon & Schuster. 435 pp. $32",

    "title": "I'm a psychotherapist who's seeing a spike in election-related anxiety among my patients. Some of them are secretly voting for Trump.",
    "content": "Alpert told BI that some of his patients are backing Trump but are reluctant to tell others.This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Jonathan Alpert -- a psychotherapist and the author of \"Be Fearless: Change Your Life in 28 Days\" -- who is seeing an uptick in anxiety among his patients regarding the 2024 presidential election. Alpert is licensed to practice in New York, Washington, D.C., Connecticut, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, so some of his patients live in hotly-contested communities in the Philadelphia and Erie areas. This year, he's hearing a range of concerns from his patients regarding both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. And even though Trump has been in the public eye as a politician for nearly a decade, Alpert said that some of patients remain \"shy\" Trump voters, or voters who are afraid to reveal that they're supporting the former president for myriad reasons.This essay has been edited for length and clarity.With this election there seems to be even more polarization than in years past, even more misinformation, and lots of uncertainty in our society. This uncertainty leads to instability and fear about the future, resulting in heightened anxiety over who is elected the next leader.Furthermore, previous election controversies are leading to a lingering sense of unease. Many people feel that the election could lead to significant social upheaval or regression. There's also a contagion effect that cannot be ignored. Social circles, family dynamics, and online communities have created tribalism and a subsequent division in our society leading to more widespread feelings of anxiety.Add into the mix the de facto nomination of Harris following  Joe Biden dropping out of the race. Many people, although they are Democrats, aren't happy about the way in which Harris became the nominee and have their reservations about voting for her. They talk to me about their lessening by the day confidence in her abilities to lead and are concerned about her lack of depth and substance when asked benign questions about her policies.As for Trump, a significant source of peoples' anxiety around him stems from disbelief that someone they view as a bully could gain such popularity. We're not taught that meanness is a path to success, yet Trump's divisiveness resonates with many, suggesting a hunger for change. Whether loved or hated, Trump gives voice to many who feel unheard. This is what worked for him in 2016 and what he is aiming for in 2024.These are people who have positive feelings towards Trump and favor his policies over those of Harris yet are not comfortable coming out with their choice to friends, family, or romantic partners. I see this play out in the lives of many of my patients.For some, they talk about assumptions made by others about their political affiliation. One patient talked to me about how everyone in her cooking class just assumes she is a liberal and hates Trump. In fact, she is not a liberal and doesn't hate Trump. She supports him. She sits in silence as the rest of the class bitches about Trump.Another patient talked about how he can't discuss with friends his frustration about the student-loan forgiveness program that he feels he shouldn't support since he didn't go to college. Any attempt he makes at having a reasonable conversation about this is quickly shot down and he is labeled a \"MAGA Republican.\" Truth is, he's a moderate Republican and works two jobs to make ends meet to support his family.There are many similar stories I've heard over the past few months. The result: These folks are overwhelmingly keeping quiet about their political beliefs and voting plans for the upcoming election and are closeted Trump supporters.For some, publicly supporting Trump could invite criticism or ostracism from friends, family, or colleagues who hold opposing views. These people fear judgment or social consequences, and this leads them to conceal their political beliefs.For many people, their political beliefs are often tied to personal identity. For closeted Trump supporters, maintaining a positive social image or protecting their personal and professional relationships can be a stronger motivator than expressing their true beliefs. People may feel torn between their personal beliefs and the need to conform to social norms or expectations.But by keeping political beliefs hidden, it can affect personal relationships. This secrecy can lead to a lack of genuine communication and potentially strain relationships with those who might be surprised or bothered if they discover their true beliefs later.My hope is that we can get to a place where Democrats and Republicans can be friends again and enjoy a dinner together despite their political differences. There was once a time when politicians duked it out in the halls of Congress but could leave it there.Many people yearn for the days of old such as when politicians like  John McCain and Biden -- who had entirely different political ideas -- were friends. People are longing for a time when being on different sides of the political aisle doesn't preclude you from being friends with someone. Demonizing someone just because they're from the opposing party is about as senseless and unhealthy as thinking \"all white people are privileged\" or \"all cops are bad.\" Statements such as these only add to the poisonous well of unhealthy thinking and anxiety that is so abundant in our society.",

    "content": "With just three weeks remaining until Election Day, Donald Trump's chances of defeating Kamala Harris have significantly improved in six of the seven critical swing states, according to recent data from the betting platform Polymarket.Trump Fighting For America Collectable Gold Coin - Fight! - Must SeeTrump has seen his favorability rise in key battleground states, including Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina, and Wisconsin.These states are expected to play a pivotal role in determining the outcome of the 2024 presidential election.In Arizona, a state that saw a narrow Democratic victory in 2020, Trump's odds of winning have climbed, reflecting a growing momentum for the former president.Similarly, his favorability has increased in Georgia and Pennsylvania, both of which were key battlegrounds in the previous election cycle.Michigan, North Carolina, and Wisconsin have also seen shifts in Trump's favor as the election nears.One notable exception to this trend is Nevada, where Harris holds a slim lead.According to Polymarket, the vice president has a 51 percent chance of winning in Nevada, while Trump is close behind at 49 percent.Despite its Democratic leanings in recent cycles, Nevada remains a closely contested state that could sway the election in either direction.Overall, Trump has gained 2.5 percent in his national odds of beating Harris.Polymarket currently places the former president's chances of victory at 56.5 percent, compared to Harris' 43.1 percent.These figures come as political bettors and analysts watch the race intensify in the final weeks before Election Day.Polymarket, which is partially funded by early Trump supporter Peter Thiel, offers a different perspective from traditional polling methods.While some national polls continue to show Harris with a narrow lead, betting markets like Polymarket often reflect a different sentiment, particularly among those who are wagering on the outcome of the election.Thomas Miller, a data scientist at Northwestern University, echoed this sentiment, predicting a landslide victory for Trump and his running mate, J.D. Vance, based on contract prices from another betting platform,PredictIt. Miller's analysis suggests that the betting markets may be capturing momentum and voter enthusiasm that traditional polls may miss.As the 2024 election approaches, the seven swing states in focus -- Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and Nevada -- are shaping up to be the deciding factor.Each state holds a significant number of electoral votes, and both campaigns are focusing heavily on these areas to secure a win.The shift in Trump's favorability across these key states signals that the race remains highly competitive, with both candidates vying for last-minute support.With Election Day just weeks away, the outcome in these battlegrounds will be critical in determining who wins the presidency in 2024.The opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of Objectivist.

He wakes in the middle of the middle and goes on a screaming fit on Truth Social. Trump began:\"A FAKE and CLASSLESS Movie written about me, called, The Apprentice (Do they even have the right to use that name without approval?), will hopefully 'bomb.' It's a cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country, 'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!'\"Then he continued:\"My former wife, Ivana, was a kind and wonderful person, and I had a great relationship with her until the day she died. The writer of this pile of garbage, Gabe Sherman, a lowlife and talentless hack, who has long been widely discredited, knew that, but chose to ignore it. So sad that HUMAN SCUM, like the people involved in this hopefully unsuccessful enterprise, are allowed to say and do whatever they want in order to hurt a Political Movement, which is far bigger than any of us. MAGA2024!\"The movie, which released on October 11, has one scene in which Donald, played by Sebastian Stan, sexually assaulted his then-wife Ivana. Something that Ivana admitted herself in divorce documents.In May, Donald threatened to sue over the movie, as his attorneys were upset over the rape scene.\"We will be filing a lawsuit to address the blatantly false assertions from these pretend filmmakers,\" the Trump campaign's Steven Cheung said on Monday, May 20. \"This garbage is pure fiction which sensationalizes lies that have been long debunked. As with the illegal Biden Trials, this is election interference by Hollywood elites, who know that President Trump will retake the White House and beat their candidate of choice because nothing they have done has worked.\"Funny how that lawsuit never actually happened, you know?Ivanka previously spoke about the sexual assault following the couple's divorce, which was finalized in 1992.She later walked back the claims in 2015, saying, \"The story is totally without merit. Donald and I are the best of friends and together have raised three children that we love and are very proud of.\"I would imagine there was a nice little payday for Ivana for walking back that claim, especially since Trump was about to run for president.Meanwhile, Sebastian Stan previously explained how he got into the mindset of Donald.\"I had 130 videos on his physicality on my phone,\" the actor previously revealed. \"And 562 videos that I had pulled with pictures from different time periods -- from the '70s all the way to today -- so I could pull out his speech patterns and try to improvise like him.\"",

    "content": "Hunter Biden's attempt to have Patrick Byrne answer questions under oath in a year-old defamation lawsuit in California federal court has been frustrated by the former Overstock CEO and 2020 election denier's recent move to Dubai and claims of a Venezuelan \"bounty on his head,\" court documents show.A joint statement from Biden and Byrne's attorneys filed last week indicates that the plaintiff and defendant have been unable to agree on where and how Byrne's deposition will occur.Nearly one year ago, before his Delaware felony gun convictions and California tax evasion admissions, Biden filed a defamation suit against Byrne, claiming that the former Overstock CEO defamed him when he falsely accused him of committing \"despicable and treasonous crimes\" involving his father President Joe Biden, bribery, Iran, and the Israel-Hamas war.Byrne, also facing a Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit, was allegedly put on notice that his \"treasonous crimes\" allegations were \"false,\" but he nonetheless \"doubled down\" in a post on Oct. 8, 2023, to link the \"horrific terrorist attacks by Hamas on Israel\" to Hunter Biden's \"purported crimes,\" the complaint said.Biden's lawyers on Oct. 9 told U.S. Magistrate Judge Patrica Donahue that Byrne's insistence on being deposed in-person in the United Arab Emirates or remotely on Zoom poses problems, since there is a \"lack of legal authority authorizing such a deposition to occur in Dubai of a U.S. citizen for use in a U.S. lawsuit.\"Those issues would not exist if the deposition was done in London or Paris, the plaintiff said, but Byrne has \"maintained for nearly a month now that he has moved his permanent residence to Dubai out of fear for his life\" Byrne apparently explained his move to Dubai was due to the belief that American law enforcement can't \"provide me with the safety I need for my personal safety.\"Court documents said that Byrne has no plans to return to the United States at least until after the 2024 presidential election. Why? Because, he says, his life is at risk as a consequence of \"covert activities\" in Venezuela :In this regard, after weeks of discussions regarding the scheduling of Defendant's deposition, counsel for Defendant made written representations to Plaintiff's counsel for the first time on September 11, 2024 that Defendant had moved his permanent residence to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and could not travel to the United States for his deposition because he \"was recently notified by the United States DEA that the Venezuelan government has a $25,000,000 on his head.\" Then, at the September 18, 2024 IDC, defense counsel made the same representations to the Court, this time on the record: \" had been involved in some covert activities in Venezuela, and he was informed by the DEA that there is a $20 million bounty on his head, and he also had been receiving death threats because of that activity.\"After Biden's attorneys said the defense \"did not provide any identifying information or contact information for anyone sufficient to allow Plaintiff to confirm Defendant's claims in this regard,\" they noted that Byrne's team also claimed to have learned of \"criminals in West Africa were cooperating to get me in a position where I could be kidnapped.\"For the plaintiff, there are \"no laws or procedures in Dubai which provide clarity as to the legality of conducting a deposition there, either in-person or remotely,\" so the case \"simply cannot proceed\" forward unless this impasse is resolved.Byrne, for his part, asserted there is no issue at all -- if Biden's attorney would just travel to Dubai.\"On October 4, 2024, this court ruled that Defendant resides in Dubai. The defendant has agreed to be deposed in person in Dubai. He has agreed to pay for one of Plaintiff's lawyers and the deposition professionals' travel expenses, accommodation, and travel time to go to Dubai to depose him there but not including the time spent at his deposition,\" the filing said. \"Since Dubai is not a member of the Hague Convention treaty and is not bound by its procedures, Defendant's deposition can be taken right away.\"",

And he didn't like being asked about it.The former world heavyweight champion is set to fight YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on 15 November, just 10 days after Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris will contest the general election.In 2020, Tyson was able to vote for the first time since his 1992 conviction and three-year imprisonment for rape after his home state, Nevada, passed legislation allowing convicted felons the right to vote.But even before being allowed to participate in presidential elections, he publicly backed Trump to assume America's highest office back in 2016, claiming he was \"voting\" for the Republican candidate.\"When I see him, he shakes my hand and respects my family,\" he said in an interview with The Daily Caller ahead of the 2016 election. \"None of them - Barack , whoever - nobody else does that. They're gonna be who they are and disregard me, my family.\"So I'm voting for him. If I can get 200,000 people or more to vote for him, I'm gonna do it.\"We're really good friends. We go back to '86, '87. Most of my successful and best fights were at Trump's hotels. He didn't manage me, though. He was just helping me with my court case.\"More recently, Tyson was asked who he plans to vote for in the 2020 ballot during a guest appearance on the podcast. And he didn't take kindly to the question.\"I'm voting for Trump,\" he snapped. \"So what's somebody going to do about it?\"I like Donald Trump and I'm gonna vote for him. So what?\"What are you gonna do? Shoot me?

Diddy' Combs bleached from the internet,\" says text over a version of the image shared October 14, 2024 on X, amid a flood of misinformation about the 2024 US presidential election.The music mogul was already facing a laundry list of similar civil suits before federal authorities arrested him in September 2024 on three criminal counts, alleging he sexually abused women and coerced them into drug-fueled sex parties using threats and violence. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. But having twice been denied bail, he is slated to remain incarcerated until his trial set for May 2025.Soon after Combs's indictment, social media users seeking to link Harris to his charges shared another doctored image supposedly showing the two together. Former president Donald Trump, Harris's Republican opponent in November's election, amplified the fake on his Truth Social platform.The latest picture purporting to show Harris and Combs side by side is also altered.A reverse image search uncovered the original photo of the Grammy winner with Hylton. Photographer Kevin Mazur snapped the shot for Getty Images in 2019 (archived here).\"Sean Combs and Misa Hylton attend Sean Combs 50th Birthday Bash presented by Ciroc Vodka on December 14, 2019 in Los Angeles, California,\" the caption says.The manipulated version circulating online is flipped horizontally and superimposes Harris's head onto Hylton's body.The fake appears to have originated with America's Last Line of Defense, a network of parody websites that publish false stories and hoaxes often mistaken for real news. A Facebook page associated with the network, which says in its bio that \"nothing on this page is real,\" shared the image in a September 30 post claiming Harris's campaign spent millions of dollars trying to scrub such photos from the internet.America's Last Line of Defense is run by Christopher Blair, who told AFP he thinks people share his content because it fits \"their confirmation-biased narrative of the world.\"\"Whether or not a thing is true no longer matters to about 35 million Americans.

    "content": "Derek Manky, Chief Security Strategist and VP of Global Threat Intelligence at Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT)As the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches, it's critical to recognize and understand the cyberthreats that may impact the integrity and trustworthiness of the election process and the welfare of the participating citizens. Cyber adversaries, including state-sponsored actors and hacktivist groups, are increasingly active leading up to major events like elections. Remaining vigilant and identifying and analyzing potential cyberthreats and vulnerabilities is crucial for preparing and safeguarding against the lures and targeted cyberattacks that could take advantage of a heightened moment in time and even disrupt or influence electoral outcomes.News SummaryFortinet ® (NASDAQ: FTNT), the global cybersecurity leader driving the convergence of networking and security, today released its FortiGuard Labs Threat Intelligence Report: Threat Actors Targeting the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, which reveals and analyzes threats tied to U.S.-based entities, voters, and the electoral process. Key findings from the threat intelligence report include:Scams Targeting the U.S. 2024 Presidential Election Flood the DarknetCyber adversaries, including state-sponsored actors and hacktivist groups, are increasingly active in the lead-up to elections.The FortiGuard Labs research team observed threat actors selling distinct phishing kits for $1,260 each, created to impersonate U.S. presidential candidates. These kits are designed to harvest personal information, including names, addresses, and credit card (donation) details.Since January 2024, FortiGuard Labs researchers have also identified more than 1,000 newly registered domain names that incorporate election-related terms and references to prominent political figures. Fraudulent fundraising websites, including secureactsbluescom, meant to imitate the legitimate site for ActBlue (secureactbluecom), a nonprofit American fundraising platform and political action committee.The top two most-used hosting providers for these election-themed websites are AMAZON-02 and CLOUDFLARENET. The reliance on major hosting platforms such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services (AWS) and Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) suggests that threat actors are leveraging these reputable services to enhance the legitimacy and resilience of their malicious domains.A notable concentration of domains is associated with a limited number of IP addresses, indicating a centralized approach by threat actors to efficiently manage multiple malicious domains to execute large-scale cyber campaigns.No Shortage of Personal Data Being Sold Aimed at the U.S.FortiGuard Labs analysis continues to show a significant number of diverse databases available on darknet forums targeting the U.S., including SSNs, usernames, email addresses, passwords, credit card data, date of birth, and other PII that could be used to challenge the integrity of the 2024 U.S. election. Specific highlights include:The U.S. Government Is an Increasingly Attractive Target (NYSE:TGT)Ransomware attacks targeting government agencies before an election can impact the electoral process and public trust in government institutions. Compared to 2023, the FortiGuard Labs research team observed a 28% spike in ransomware attacks against the U.S. government in 2024.The darknet has become a hub for U.S.-specific threats, where malicious actors trade sensitive information and can potentially develop strategies to exploit vulnerabilities. Approximately 3% of the posts on these forums involve databases related to business and government entities. These databases hold critical organizational data that is vulnerable to cyber exploits and are a prime target for threat actors as the elections come and go.Recommendations to Prevent and Mitigate Cyberattacks this Election SeasonCybersecurity measures are critical to safeguard the integrity of the U.S. 2024 presidential election.

    "content": "In a nostalgic nod to her fairy-tale roots, Anne Hathaway made a memorable appearance at a Kamala Harris fundraiser in New York City, bringing a touch of her \"Ella Enchanted\" days to the event.The actress, known for her role in the beloved 2004 film, captivated attendees with her grace and charisma, all while advocating for the Vice President's campaign.At the event, Anne Hathaway belted out Queen's \"Somebody to Love\" for Kamala Harris supporters.The actress took the stage at the \"Broadway for Harris\" event, belting out the rock band's most iconic love ballad with passion and pride. Naturally, Hathaway is well-acquainted with the song, having performed the Queen anthem in one memorable scene as her character in \"Ella Enchanted.\"Aside from a stellar rendition of the hit song, Anne Hathaway encouraged Americans to get out and vote on November 5. \"We got a big choice to make, America, you have to make a choice, you do have to vote. Maybe this election, maybe you don't have a candidate that you love, but you have to have an issue that you,\" she. said. \"Maybe the somebody you love is you. You gotta vote for yourself, America.\"Check out the video here.This is not the first time Hathaway has dipped her toes in the political discussion.In a video posted on Instagram on Saturday, October 5, the \"Princess Diaries\" actress showcased her outfit of the day while urging her followers to register to vote, reminding them that the election is just 30 days away.Plus, in 2018, she shared her fears about the bigotry directed at the LGBTQ community, but a speech from former Vice President Joe Biden renewed her faith. \"I think I'm probably walking around like most people right now,\" she said, per The New York Post. \"I'm pretty shell-shocked by what I see every day, what I hear every day. And I really don't like to admit this, but I get scared.\"\"It is important to acknowledge with the exception of being a cisgender male, everything about how I was born has put me at the current center of a damaging and widely accepted myth,\" she continued. \"That myth is that gayness orbits around straightness, transgender orbits around cisgender and that all races orbit around whiteness.\"Hathaway revealed that her experiences with the LGBTQ community -- particularly because her older brother is gay -- have taught her to challenge and reject this myth.\"I appreciate this community because together we are not going to just question this myth, we are going to destroy it,\" she said in 2018. \"Let's tear this world apart and build a better one.\"As Vice President, Harris has consistently advocated against anti-LGBTQ+ legislation in the U.S., including bans on gender-affirming care for youth and \"don't say gay\" laws that limit discussions about sexuality and gender identity in schools.Sam Elliot, Halle Bailey, Jeremy Jordan, Taylor Swift, and Magic Johnson have all publicly thrown their support behind Kamala Harris.\"I'm voting for the rights of all my beautiful LGTBQ+ friends and family,\" Jeremy Jordan said on Instagram last week. \"I'm voting for the rights of women to be able to make choices about their own damn bodies. I'm voting for just plain human decency. I'm voting for strength measured by compassion instead of cruelty.\"\"Breaking Bad\" star Bryan Cranston recently stepped into the political arena by endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris for the 2024 presidential election.During an event titled \"Fighting for Reproductive Freedom,\" held on Saturday, October 12, the focus was squarely on abortion rights. The 68-year-old actor took the stage to express his views on \"the freedom of choice,\" highlighting his personal connection as a father to a daughter.\"I am not a politician. I am not a doctor or a lawyer, but I played all of those on TV. But I am a father of a daughter, and it's important to me for her life now, for the future other father's daughters to be able to have within their lifetime the fundamental right, freedom of choice,\" Cranston said at the event. \"There should not be anyone but them deciding what happens to their own bodies.\"\"And that's why I am enthusiastically supporting Vice President Harris and Governor Walz,\" he announced.",

    "title": "Virginia election officials refuse to certify November vote amid lawsuit",
    "content": "Two Republican officials are contesting the voting system ahead of the 2024 presidential election.A lawsuit, filed in a Virginia courtroom, suggests that Republicans may contest the validity of the Virginia election at a later date. In echoes of Republican objections for the 2020 election, one official claims that the voting machines may be secretly hooked up to the internet, which would allow somebody to externally alter the results.In the lawsuit, two Republican appointees to the Waynesboro Electoral Board complained that the voting machines are not verifiable and the voting will not be conducted in the open. Former President Donald Trump beat President Joe Biden by less than 600 votes in Waynesboro in 2020.The lawsuit was filed in Waynesboro Circuit Court by Curtis Lilly, the chairman of the Waynesboro Electoral Board, and Scott Mares, the board's vice chair, against Virginia Department of Elections Commissioner Susan Beals and State Board of Elections Chairman John O'Bannon.The lawsuit states: \"Board members are unable to personally review and verify that the voting machine program being used to count the ballots is keeping a true and accurate count; the voting machine program being used to count the ballots is recording the true and accurate count; and/or that the voting machine record tape accurately represents the ballots cast.\"The plaintiffs believe that the voting machine is counting the votes in secret because neither the program counting the votes recorded on the ballots nor the ballots themselves can be examined.\"Newsweek sought email comment on Tuesday from the Waynesboro Electoral Board and the Virginia Department of Elections.Lilly attached an affidavit in which he explained that he \"cannot ensure that the machines do not connect to the internet, allowing for vote counting algorithm manipulation, nor can I ensure with any certainty that the electronic ballot scanners are presenting results which are consistent with the contents of the ballot box.\"I have taken an oath to uphold the Virginia Constitution, which prohibits the secret canvassing of ballots. As such, I believe that certifying the 2024 election would be a violation of the Virginia Constitution.\"In the 2020 election, Trump and several key allies claimed that voting machines were rigged for Biden across the country. Two voting machine companies have since taken legal action for defamation.In April 2023, Fox News settled a defamation suit with Dominion Voting Systems for $787 million and other cases are pending against former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, businessman Mike Lindell and others.In November 2016, Trump contested the Virginia result while running against Hillary Clinton. In a post-election comment on social media, he wrote that there was \"serious voter fraud\" in Virginia.In response, Waynesboro registrar Lisa Jeffers denied that there were any problems.\"I feel very comfortable and confident that the election was exactly as people wanted to see it turn out,\" she told Virginia's Staunton News Leader.Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, Clinton's running mate, wrote on social media that Trump should not \"insult our voters\" with such claims.",

    "title": "Chicago organizers have a history of building bridges - Chicago Reader",
    "content": "Chicago organizers have long joined together across racial, ethnic, and geographic lines in the fight for a better city.When the sun rose over Chicago on the first day of the 2024 Democratic National Convention, out-of-towners were undoubtedly impressed by the city's downtown high-rises, jibaritos, and hot dogs, and protesters donned in keffiyehs and holding picket signs.Tens of thousands of protesters representing issues from tenants' rights to police abolition flooded the streets of the most segregated U.S. metropolitan city to tease out its impurities like a pressure washer. The U.S. Palestinian Community Network (USPCN) brought together a multitude of people from 300 organizations under the banner of the Coalition to March on DNC 2024 to show Democrats that enabling Israel's genocide on Gaza would lose them their progressive voting bloc in the 2024 presidential election.This Chicago-style coalition building is an age-old tradition, one that forges connections in direct opposition to narratives pitting communities against one another. The organizing that took over the city this summer offers a moment to pause and reflect on what coalition-building has looked like over the years and what it has accomplished.USPCN was founded in 2006 near the end of the second intifada -- a period of major uprisings by Palestinians in Jerusalem, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem between 2000 and 2005 -- to build grassroots political power in Palestinian and Arab communities across the U.S. The organization has chapters in Los Angeles, the Bay Area, Milwaukee, Cleveland, the Detroit metropolitan area, New York City, and Washington, D.C. But its largest chapter, like the largest Palestinian American community in the U.S., is in Chicagoland.Among USPCN's founders are the late George Adib Khoury, who was active with the Detroit chapter of the Black Panther Party, and others who worked on Harold Washington's historic mayoral campaign and Jesse Jackson's presidential run.\"There are these elders who have lived some of the most important history,\" says Muhammad Sankari, who's been organizing with the Chicago chapter for 14 years. \"We never feel like we're reinventing the wheel. . . . We are just taking  knowledge and experience and applying it to new conditions.\"USPCN has forged a close relationship with the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression (CAARPR). In January, as the City Council geared up for a vote on a resolution in support of a ceasefire in Gaza, the groups worked together to flood the phones of Black and Brown alders with messages in support of the measure. And in 2020, amid nationwide uprisings against police violence following the murder of George Floyd, Arab American store owners stood armed on their shop rooftops, which were located in Black neighborhoods, to defend against potential looters. USPCN and CAARPR told store owners to go home and organized a caravan rally through Little Palestine to disavow the store owners' responses\"That was distinctly to raise the call of Black Lives Matter in the heart of the Arab community,\" Sankari says. \"And to make a public pronouncement that this one thing that's happened does not represent our community.\"Starbucks Workers United (SBWU), among them burgeoning queer labor organizers, brought their baristas to the front lines of the March on the DNC. The Democratic Party, at face value, supports unions and worker movements. But members of SBWU Chicago understand the urgency of aligning themselves with workers both foreign and domestic.\"I'm a barista. Think of someone who works as a barista in Palestine,\" says Lily Elling, who works at a store in Greektown. \"What are their working conditions right now? Think of someone who works as a mailman in Palestine. There's a genocide being enacted on laborers in Palestine. It's the same fight .\"As a member of the March on DNC Coalition, SBWU Chicago has connected with other labor unions like the United Auto Workers, which represents employees from Ford's south-side factory, and regularly sends baristas to join their picket lines. UAW sends workers to support SBWU's strikes, too.SBWU has been in a nationwide fight with Starbucks for four years. But their employers only came to the table in the past six months, following mass public solidarity withPalestine. Consumers boycotted the company after a Starbucks union in New York faced legal backlash for tweeting a message in solidarity with Palestine in late 2023. The coffee company's stock has dropped more than 10 percent since the pro-Palestininan boycott started.Organizers with MAMAS (Mamas Activating Movements for Abolition and Solidarity) joined the DNC Coalition to bring their feminist, reproductive justice-oriented, and abolitionist lens to the demonstrations. The group provides resources to a group of ten mostly Black and Latinx moms who are actively mothering and caring for incarcerated survivors of Chicago police torture and frame-ups. All of their sons have been jailed for at least a decade.MAMAS has a long-standing relationship with the Palestinian Feminist Collective. Throughout the year, members of both organizations host dinners together, take part in direct actions at the Cook County Jail, and join together for strategy meetings.MAMAS posted on Instagram a week before the convention announcing that they planned to show up and demand freedom for their kids, resources for their communities, and justice for mothers and families everywhere. Mothers in Palestine, says MAMAS associate director Erica Bentley, deal with a different face of the same beast. \"The forces are learning from each other,\" she says. \"Our struggles are the same struggle.\"MAMAS mothers saw their kids jailed between 18 and 22 years old, and haven't been able to experience that natural progression other mothers witness as their kids go from child to adult. Moms and sons miss out on shared developmental milestones like graduating high school and finding lifelong partners, and their relationship stays in a perpetual dynamic of the mother caring for their vulnerable child.\"If we're looking at the ability to parent and raise children and families in a safe and sustainable way,\" Bentley says, \"prison is the ultimate violation of that by the state.\"In the 1950s and '60s, neighborhoods across Chicago were awash in segregation, police brutality, and inequality. Against this backdrop, community leaders from Kenwood to Pilsen to Uptown organized not just within their own neighborhoods but between neighborhoods, laying the groundwork for a multiracial socialist alliance the following decade.At the invitation of 44 civil rights organizations, remembered as the Chicago Freedom Movement, Martin Luther King Jr. brought his civil rights crusade to Chicago in late 1965. King arrived at a time when organizing across the city was already happening. Using a 17-month campaign of boycotts, marches, and lobbying in the Windy City, King bolstered local efforts to desegregate schools and housing.Following King's assassination in 1968, Fred Hampton of the Illinois Black Panther Party capitalized on the growing momentum and fervor of the civil rights movement. He reached out to the Young Lords Organization, a former Puerto Rican street gang turned political organization, and working-class whites, known as the Young Patriots, to form perhaps one of the most formidable and noteworthy examples of Chicagoans discarding their differences to accomplish work that'll benefit them all: the blue-collar Rainbow Coalition.\"Coalitions really came out of different people collectively working in their own neighborhood and then going beyond their neighborhoods and finding common ground to build a coalition to push back against the oppression of Daley the Chicago machine,\" explains Jane Ramsey, who teaches courses on coalition building and community organizing to undergrads at the University of Chicago.Ramsey was born in Chicago in 1950 and grew up during the civil rights era. She says there are a myriad of strategies to forming alliances. They include organizations giving each other \"one-on-ones\" about their struggle, attending demonstrations on behalf of one another, and taking to the streets to spread each other's messages. \"We can't get anything done by ourselves,\" she says. \"We make change happen by building a coalition.\"But she says building a coalition of like-minded organizations is only part of the work. \"We have to have a set of values and a vision of the world that we want. What is that world that we're working toward? How do we listen, hear each other, and ensure that we organize around a set of values?\"The Black Panther Party established community-run \"survival programs\" like free breakfasts, medical care, clothes, legal aid, and more. These programs aimed to meet community needs through interdependence while simultaneously changing social conditions until an inevitable and necessary working-class revolution ruptured the current social, political, and economic conditions. \"All these programs satisfy the deep needs of the community,\" the Panthers wrote in a pamphlet titled Service to the People Programs. \"But they are not solutions to our problems.\" The Young Lords and Young Patriots took up the Panthers' model and established similar systems in their own communities.Hampton was murdered by police in 1969, but Chicago leaders and organizers like Jesse Jackson continued to ride this coalition-style momentum through Harold Washington's mayoral campaign in the early '80s. Chicago's first Black mayor appointed low-income and Black and Latinx people to his cabinet -- empowering communities who had never before had access to City Hall -- and invested in things like school reform and community health centers.\"Where we are today, where there's a lot of really robust organizing and relationships across communities, that's really in the tradition of what we saw coming out of the civil rights movement,\" says Ramsey.All of that to say, whether we're talking about the DNC or Harold Washington's campaign, it's clear that local organizers have a well-respected organizing playbook to consult when challenging systems of power: grab some friends and form an all-star team, Olympic-style.The Illinois Network for Pretrial Justice (INPJ), for example, a statewide coalition of 45 community faith, legal, and policy organizations, proved what can be accomplished when we organize together.The group began in 2016 as the Coalition to End Money Bond -- a collective working around what they saw as the overuse of pretrial incarceration and electronic monitoring at the Cook County jail. Community groups like Southsiders Organized for Unity and Liberation, MacArthur Justice Center, Shriver Center on Poverty Law, Trinity United Church of Christ, and Community Renewal Society focused their efforts on reducing the number of people incarcerated in Cook County for not paying bond. The coalition expanded statewide in 2018.How did these groups come together and find common ground? When members of what would become the Coalition to End Money Bond first gathered around a table in 2016, they developed six principles of bond reform in Cook County that they'd use to guide their shared work.\"The community organizers are building the base, educating the public, pushing the conversation, and creating a space where, then, policy experts and lawyers come in and create the  for the reform or law,\" says Matthew McLoughlin, INPJ's campaign coordinator.The first major win for the Coalition to End Money Bond was called General Order 18.8A, which instructed judges in Cook County to set bonds at affordable prices. The shift came after MacArthur Justice Center, law firm Hughes Socol Piers Resnick & Dym, Ltd., and the Civil Rights Corps sued Cook County over unconstitutional bail practices. According to McLoughlin, the suit -- plus the hundreds of community members who mobilized for court-watching efforts -- resulted in 10,000 fewer people passing through jail every year.But the biggest win of the coalition is undoubtedly the Pretrial Fairness Act (part of the 2021 SAFE-T Act that took effect in September 2023), which made Illinois the first state in the country to completely end the practice of jailing people because they couldn't afford to post bail. The bill included a harvest of protections for survivors of domestic violence, protections for people on electronic monitoring, and warrant reform that collectively transformed Illinois' pretrial system. Some examples of those changes are requiring the issuing of tickets instead of custodial arrest, expanding access to counsel, restricting the use of pretrial incarceration, and making it possible to review cases of people already incarcerated pretrial. In 2024, the coalition built on their progress with the Pretrial Success Act, which dedicates resources for substance use treatment, mental health care, and case management services for people awaiting trial.When coalition members would speak with press or host public education events, they made sure \"our messaging was in line with each other,\" McLoughlin says. \"When people were having meetings with stakeholders, we were again adhering to these principles that maybe weren't the dream vision that any of these organizations had, but they were a consensus that we could all feel good about working together on. . . . That has served as a foundation for all of our work over what is now nearly a decade.\"It's that meeting in the middle, that support across neighborhoods, that builds the momentum needed to reach solutions that serve us all: whether we're baristas or mothers in Chicago or Palestine, working-class people in white neighborhoods or Black neighborhoods; in the suburbs or in the city.Ramsey says she dreams of education for everyone, where every person has access to housing and health care. In a city separated by transit routes that reinforce racial inequities, where some segregated Black neighborhoods cry out against South American migrants, where south- and west-side schools scramble to teach with a fraction of the resources held by north-side facilities, organizers have a decades-old playbook for subduing those forces.\"For us to get to that point, we have to be able to cross boundaries and build a strong coalition, build a strong movement, that has a shared vision and is willing to speak with one another and educate our different communities to grow that shared vision,\" Ramsey says.",

    "content": "Kamala Harris is predicted to vastly underperform in the 2024 presidential election amongst male and black voters compared to previous Democratic candidates.In an attempt to appeal to black men, the Harris campaign published an \"opportunity agenda\" Monday evening.\"Black men deserve a president who cares about making their lives better,\" Harris wrote.Harris was accused of racism for the \"opportunity agenda.\"\"Kamala Harris announced she wants segregated policies for men based off their skin color. She thinks black men need different policies than white men. Weird. Seems racist,\" Laura Loomer wrote.\"Attaching marijuana to black people as a campaign promise is so next level racist it's astounding,\" Alan Roberts commented.Some accused Harris of attempting to buy black votes.\"I think this is racist and unfair. All entrepreneurs should be offered help and this is Kamala buying black votes She will not get my vote,\" Terrence Williams said.\"Kamala Harris is trying to buy black votes How is this not racist? Not only is it racist but it seems like Kamala is betting on black entrepreneurs not ever being successful enough to pay a loan back,\" Kylie Jane Kremer commented.Vice President Kamala Harris unveiled an \"Opportunity Agenda\" proposal for Black men Monday, which includes plans to provide 1 million forgivable loans to Black entrepreneurs and new pathways to help Black Americans succeed in the legalized marijuana industry.\"This agenda is a further realization of Vice President Harris' Opportunity Economy,\" said former Rep. Cedric Richmond, a Harris campaign co-chair, in a statement. \"An economy where people don't just get by, but get ahead. Where Black men are equipped with the tools to thrive: to buy a home, provide for our families, start a business and build wealth.\"Harris' announcement is aimed at increasing her support among Black male voters, and comes in the final weeks of an extremely close race between the Democratic vice president and Republican former President Donald Trump.The plan outlined Monday would provide 1 million fully forgivable loans of up to $20,000 to Black entrepreneurs and others to start a business. The loans would be financed through partnerships between \"mission-driven lenders,\" community oriented banks and the Small Business Administration, the campaign said.The agenda also includes training and mentorship programs to help Black men get jobs in high-demand industries, and greater investments in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to recruit and retain Black male teachers.\"Kamala Harris is proposing $20,000 forgivable loans to black entrepreneurs. Is this just a desperation move to try to lure black men into voting for her? There is no way this type of program would be legal or it would ever pass Congress. It is basically just an attempt at a $20,000 bribe for votes,\" Wall Street Silver wrote.\"I rarely get offended, but I am OFFENDED by Kamala Harris's agenda for black men. Not only is it degrading, it goes against everything the founding fathers and civil rights leaders fought for. It's also an attempt to BRIBE black people into voting for her,\" George Behizy said.",

    "title": "Economic factors and currency volatility in the 2024 US presidential election",
    "content": "The U.S. Presidential elections are approaching, and although there are many political and societal factors that may determine the outcome of an election, November 2024 may be affected by economic factors. Voters are closely monitoring the economy due to the high inflation experienced in the aftermath of COVID-19. To combat inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates 11 times since April 2022. Although inflation has declined from its 2022 peak, it remains a concern in certain sectors, explains OANDA's market analyst Moheb Hanna.In a year where monetary policy decisions by world central banks continue to dominate headlines, the Federal Reserve has only recently made its first cut since 2020, cutting rates by a staggering 50 basis points. This more \"cautious\" approach contrasts those of the European Central Bank and the Bank of Canada, who opted to reduce interest rates much earlier in the year following a steady decline in inflation indicators.In the post-COVID period, the U.S. has experienced strong economic growth and a robust job market, outperforming global economies. Recent data, however, indicates that Americans are spending more cautiously, seeking bargains, and reducing leisure spending.Which Currency Pairs Are Likely to be Most Affected by the Volatility Surrounding the U.S. Presidential Election?As the world's reserve currency, the U.S. dollar often experiences fluctuations in value due to various factors. This volatility is expected to increase around the U.S. elections as global currencies and commodities are priced against the dollar. Moreover, the Federal Reserve's November meeting, scheduled during the election week, will likely amplify market volatility due to anticipated interest rate decisions and economic announcements.The anticipated market volatility surrounding the election may present diverse trading opportunities across various currency pairs and timeframes. Prolonged uncertainty or delayed election results could extend this period of heightened volatility, potentially offering even more trading prospects. As the November 2024 presidential election approaches, traders are likely anticipating numerous election-driven trading opportunities in the currency markets. Some traders may also position themselves ahead of the election, therefore, volatility may have already started.1. USD/MXN: Price action during 2016 and 2020 U.S. elections, Mexico's elections, USMCA agreement and COVID-19The Mexican peso has been a strong performer over the past two years, primarily due to high interest rates, economic growth, and increased cooperation with U.S. businesses. This has presented a significant carry trade opportunity, with Mexico's interest rate at 11.25% compared to the U.S. dollar's 5.50%. Although the peso has experienced fluctuations, including a 37% rise against the USD from March 2020 to July 2023 and a subsequent rebound to 18.10 in June 2024, it remains an attractive investment for some investors. Pre-election positioning, driven by factors like interest rate differentials and differing inflation rates between the two countries, may influence the USD/MXN exchange rate. Historical trends show varying peso responses to U.S. elections, with potential implications depending on whether Harris or Trump wins. While Harris's win might maintain the status quo, Trump's win could reintroduce tariff concerns. Additionally, Mexico's strong economic ties with the U.S., particularly through the USMCA, add another layer of complexity to the USD/MXN relationship.2. USD/JPY: Price action during 2016 and 2020 US elections, FOMC Interest Rate hikes and Bank of Japan interventionIn March 2024, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) concluded its extensive monetary easing program, including its negative interest rate policies, which had been in place for over eight years. The central bank maintained its interest rate at 0.10%. Traders are now closely watching for any signals from the BOJ regarding quantitative tightening (QT), as the bank is expected to gradually reduce its bond holdings. This process, if not carefully managed, could potentially disrupt the market. To mitigate this, the BOJ might opt to reduce bond purchases at a slower rate than their holding expiration, a strategy requiring cautious execution.The Japanese yen is currently trading near its lowest point versus the dollar in 38 years, and at a level not seen since 1986, worrying traders. Despite both the U.S. and Japan maintaining their interest rates for a prolonged period, the yen has continued to weaken against the dollar, contributing to market uncertainty. As a result, and in a measure to stop \"excessive fluctuations driven by speculation,\" the Bank of Japan is known to have intervened at least once in recent history, aiming to prop up yen prices. Owing to abnormalities in price action, some traders have speculated that market intervention has happened more than just once, but the BOJ has yet to officially confirm.Although the BOJ is in a rate-raising mode and the Fed is expected to cut rates, the interest rate differential between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen remains appealing. Carry trades on USD/JPY can still offer returns for long-term investors, though these returns may be lower than other carry trade opportunities. However, they might also involve less risk compared to other available carry trade pairs.3. EUR/USD: Price action during 2016 and 2020 US electionsThe EUR/USD is the most frequently traded currency pair in the foreign exchange markets. During events that impact global markets, like the U.S. elections, the euro tends to be more susceptible to market risks. This is primarily due to changes in U.S. interest rates affecting the U.S. dollar, rather than the euro itself. EU inflation has seen a recent uptick in May 2024, rising to 2.6% year-on-year, primarily driven by energy costs. This follows a period of steady decline since its peak in March/April 2022. The ECB, having already reduced interest rates by 25 basis points on June 6th, 2024, is now faced with the challenge of balancing inflation control with potential future rate cuts. The latest inflation increase, while bringing the indicator closer to pre-pandemic averages, adds complexity to the ECB's decision-making process.Historically, the euro has reacted to shifts in US leadership. It initially declined under Trump's presidency, falling 8.5% to 1.0320. However, it later rebounded, reaching 1.2550 against the dollar. A sharp drop occurred in early 2018, finding support above 1.0600 during COVID-19, followed by another rise to 1.2200. With Biden's inauguration and the onset of the Ukraine war, coupled with FOMC interest rate hikes, the euro experienced a significant decline of 22.80%, reaching below parity at 0.9600. It has since partially recovered, trading within the 1.0550 - 1.1200 range in early 2023.4. USD/CAD: Price action during 2016 and 2020 US elections, USMCA agreement and COVID-19Canada, a major economic partner of the USA, has a highly correlated economy. The USD/CAD exchange rate is influenced by interest rates in both countries and oil prices, as Canada is a significant oil producer and a member of OPEC+. As Trump took office in January 2017, and when Biden did in January 2021, the Canadian dollar rose significantly against the U.S. dollar as an initial reaction, and in both cases, the exchange price returned to its pre-election levels. Under the Trump administration, the USD/CAD rate remained relatively stable during the negotiation and implementation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which took effect on July 1st, 2020. However, anticipatory market positioning was evident before that.Canadian inflation has followed global trends, rising post-COVID and then declining sharply after peaking around 8% in mid-2022. By early 2024, key inflation measures remained below 3%. This decline, coupled with weaker-than-expected economic growth, led to anticipation of the Bank of Canada's actions. On June 5, 2024, the Bank of Canada became the first to cut interest rates by 25 basis points. Governor Tiff Macklem emphasized data-driven decision-making for future adjustments.Despite strong retail sales over the past five years, recent months have shown a decline in specific categories, suggesting consumer caution and potential delays in interest-sensitive purchases. This trend is noteworthy as it coincides with a slowdown in Canada's GDP growth since late 2021.",

    "title": "With three weeks to go for U.S election, Harris is losing her gains and Trump is inching up",
    "content": "As the US election 2024 gets closer, multiple survey polls predicted a close race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Though Harris began with an advantage after taking Joe Biden's place on the Democratic ticket, the gap has narrowed, even reaching a near tie according to some polls. Momentum is in Trump's favor as his support rating among Republicans rises.Three weeks before the US Election Day, the latest polls indicate that the race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump is closing. A set of three national polls is bringing out Trump's momentum, though Harris' success is fading away. The ABC News/Ipsos poll shows Harris leading 50 per cent-48 per cent, down from a six-point advantage, while the NBC News poll has the two candidates tied at 48 per cent, as per a report.The increasing lead of Harris, which was her high after stepping in place of Biden as the Democratic candidate, has been lost in the recent weeks. CBS News/YouGov statistics display a three-point lead for Harris, dwindled from a four-point lead the previous month. Apart from a surge after the Democratic convention and a strong September debate, Harris, on the other hand, has had her favorable ratings slide to the detriment of the race as it approaches Election Day, Fox News reported.Also Read : As Biden's student debt agenda is in tatters, will it hurt Harris in the U.S elections?The Republican Party is a solid wall behind Trump, as the new election approaches, with the view of Kamala Harris more and more likely as a continuation of the Biden presidency. GOP leader Neil Newhouse is of the opinion that it is amazing that at a pivotal time just before the election, Harris might be struggling, with Trump overtaking her on the main battleground states, which will in all likelihood decide the election's outcome.The national polls might suggest a close race, yet the real duel is in seven battle areas, which Joe Biden had to get to win in 2020. These states are considered to be the determining factors in the 2024 presidential election, and in addition, their respective polling data are such that it is a statistical equivalent race, thus making difficult the projection of the final result.Also Read: Another scandal in the making?

The ABC News/Ipsos poll puts Harris up by 50 per cent to 48 per cent, while other polls indicated the two as being tied or with close results.Q2: Why is Kamala Harris losing the ground in the survey?A2: Kamala Harris' earlier gains have slowed, partly due to Republicans consolidating behind Trump and a perception that Harris represents a continuation of Biden's administration.

    "title": "Presidents of the United States: Zachary Taylor, a conflict-ridden soldier-president",
    "content": "Editor's Note: This is part of a series of profiles taking a closer look at US presidents ahead of the 2024 presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.Zachary Taylor, the 12th President of the United States, was a military hero before entering the presidency.Known as \"Old Rough and Ready\" for his rugged demeanour and battlefield successes, Taylor's brief time in office was marked by the rising tensions over slavery, which he opposed expanding into the newly acquired territories from the Mexican-American War.His unexpected death in 1850 left unresolved issues that would eventually lead to the American Civil War.Taylor in the militaryZachary Taylor was born on November 24, 1784, in Orange County, Virginia. He came from a prominent family with ties to the early American colonies.His father, Richard Taylor, served as a lieutenant colonel in the Continental Army during the American Revolution. In 1785, the family moved to Kentucky, where Taylor was raised on a plantation.Taylor entered the US Army in 1808 as a first lieutenant and quickly distinguished himself in a military career that spanned more than four decades.He served in several conflicts, including the War of 1812, the Black Hawk War, and the Second Seminole War. Taylor's military career was marked by his leadership and tactical skill, earning him promotions and the respect of his peers.Taylor's national fame, however, came during the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), where he led American forces to victory in several key battles, including the Battle of Palo Alto and the Battle of Buena Vista.His success in the war made him a national hero and laid the foundation for his eventual run for the presidency.Taylor wins the electionDespite having no prior political experience, Taylor was nominated as the Whig Party's candidate for president in 1848. His military reputation and status as a national hero helped him win the election, defeating Democrat Lewis Cass and former US President Martin Van Buren, who ran as a candidate for the Free Soil Party.Taylor was a reluctant politician, but his status as a political outsider appealed to many voters. He avoided taking clear positions on controversial issues during the campaign, particularly slavery, which was increasingly dividing the country.This allowed him to win support from both Northern and Southern voters.Taylor in the White HouseZachary Taylor took office on March 4, 1849, during a period of intense debate over the status of slavery in the newly acquired territories from the Mexican-American War.Although Taylor was a slaveholder himself, he opposed the expansion of slavery into the Western territories. He believed that the settlers in these regions should decide whether to allow slavery, a stance that angered many Southern leaders.One of the key challenges of Taylor's presidency was addressing the issue of California's admission to the Union. In 1849, California, spurred by the Gold Rush, sought to enter the Union as a free state.Taylor supported California's admission as a free state without forcing the issue of slavery into the debate, despite strong opposition from Southern politicians who feared losing political power if more free states were admitted.Taylor's refusal to support a compromise that would appease both Northern and Southern factions placed him at odds with many in Congress, particularly Southern leaders like Senator John C Calhoun.Taylor threatened to use military force to keep Southern states in the Union if they attempted secession, a stance that foreshadowed the eventual Civil War.Taylor's death during termZachary Taylor's presidency was cut short when he fell ill after attending a Fourth of July celebration in 1850. He died on July 9, 1850, just 16 months into his term, making him one of the shortest-serving US presidents.Taylor's death came at a critical moment in the nation's history, as the debate over slavery and sectionalism was reaching a boiling point.Following his death, US Vice President Millard Fillmore assumed the presidency and supported the Compromise of 1850, a package of bills that aimed to ease tensions between free and slave states.While the compromise temporarily calmed sectional tensions, it also delayed the inevitable conflict that would erupt into the Civil War.Taylor's family & legacyTaylor's legacy is often viewed through the lens of his military career rather than his brief presidency.As a soldier, Taylor was widely respected for his leadership and tactical acumen.As president, he is remembered for his firm stance against the expansion of slavery, despite the fact that he did not live to see the outcome of the debate that would define the nation's future.Zachary Taylor was married to Margaret Mackall Smith, and the couple had six children, including their daughter Sarah Knox Taylor, who briefly married future Confederate President Jefferson Davis.Despite his Southern roots and ownership of slaves, Taylor's opposition to the spread of slavery into new territories was a defining aspect of his political views.",

    "title": "CNN Senior Data Reporter: 'This Is What Gives Democrats Agita' [WATCH]",
    "content": "CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten raised concerns Monday over Kamala Harris' polling averages in critical battleground states, noting they are trailing significantly compared to Democratic candidates in previous election cycles.During an appearance on \"The Lead with Jake Tapper,\" Enten highlighted Harris' slipping support in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, three states that have played decisive roles in past presidential elections.Enten reported that Harris' leads in those three states have narrowed to just a single percentage point as of October, down from a 2-point advantage in September.Trump Fighting For America Collectable Gold Coin - Fight! - Must SeeThese numbers stand in stark contrast to the stronger leads held by both Joe Biden and former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at the same point in previous elections.On October 14 of both 2016 and 2020, Biden and Clinton were each leading in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin by an average of 8 points, according to Enten.\"I have never seen such consistently tight polling such as this across the battleground states in all the time I have been looking and covering politics,\" Enten said during the segment. He warned that these slim leads are causing significant concern within the Democratic Party. \"It looks like Harris is slightly ahead, though well within the margin of error. But compared to where we were 4 years ago and 8 years ago, at this point Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, an average across all three,\" Enten explained, emphasizing the difference from past Democratic performances.Enten went on to reference how the 2020 election played out, reminding viewers that even though Biden was polling ahead by 8 points at this stage in the race, he ultimately won these states by much smaller margins.Hillary Clinton, despite holding a similar 8-point lead in 2016, lost all three states to Donald Trump.\"Harris is up by 1 point across the three states, but Biden was up by 8, and Clinton was up by 8. I don't have to tell you that Hillary Clinton lost all three of these states. Joe Biden barely won all three of these states,\" Enten said, underscoring the challenges Democrats face.He added, \"Democrats have to ask themselves at this particular point, can Harris actually hold on given that Joe Biden barely did, and Hillary Clinton did not?\"Polling data has shown a widening gap between the numbers and actual results on election day in these critical states.In Wisconsin, for example, a FiveThirtyEight poll in November 2020 showed Biden leading Trump by 8.4 points, but he only narrowly won the state by a margin of 49.6% to 48.9%.Similarly, in Michigan, polls indicated Biden had a near 8-point lead, but he ultimately won by just 3 points.In Pennsylvania, Biden won with 50% of the vote compared to Trump's 48.8%, despite polling showing him ahead by nearly 5 points.Enten also pointed to a troubling scenario for Democrats. According to his analysis, if Trump manages to outperform in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan by even 1 point over his previous performance, it could result in him securing a commanding 312 electoral votes.As Harris continues to campaign, the Democratic Party will be closely monitoring these polling numbers in the Great Lakes region.The results in these key battleground states are likely to be crucial in determining the outcome of the 2024 presidential election.The opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of LifeZette.

    "title": "Darknet Activity Increases Ahead of 2024 Presidential Vote",
    "content": "A surge in cyber threat activity targeting the 2024 US Presidential election has been observed by security researchers.Compiled by FortiGuard Labs, Fortinet's cybersecurity research division, the report outlines key threats, including phishing scams, malicious domain registrations and the sale of sensitive US data on darknet forums.Phishing attacks designed to deceive voters are a primary concern. Researchers discovered that threat actors are selling phishing kits which impersonate US presidential candidates and their campaigns for $1260.These kits are used to collect personal information, including credit card details. Furthermore, over 1000 new domain names linked to the election have been registered since January 2024.Many of these sites are designed to look like legitimate fundraising platforms, such as the fraudulent \"secureactsbluescom,\" mimicking the nonprofit ActBlue.The darknet has also become a hotbed of election-related cyber activity. Billions of records, including Social Security numbers, email addresses and passwords, are being sold in these forums.FortiGuard researchers found that approximately 3% of darknet posts involve databases related to US business and government entities, heightening concerns about potential identity theft and account takeovers.A particularly alarming statistic is the availability of over 1.3 billion rows of usernames and passwords in \"combo lists,\" used for credential-stuffing attacks.\"While it may be difficult to use these records to commit the kind of fraud or attacks that would directly modify the outcome of an election it's certainly a cheap and simple exercise to simply highlight the possibility of their use as a way to instill distrust in the democratic process, and to potential affect and manipulate voter turnout,\" warned Bugcrowd founder Casey Ellis.Read more on cyber threats to the electoral process: NCSC Expands Election Cybersecurity to Safeguard Candidates and OfficialsRansomware attacks have also seen a 28% rise in 2024 compared to the previous year, with a marked focus on US government agencies. These attacks could disrupt the election process and further damage public trust in the system.To safeguard against these risks, Fortinet recommends several preventive measures:\"Election officials and political campaigns need to be investing in AI-driven threat intelligence, conduct regular security assessments, and enforce strict access controls,\" added Sectigo CTO, Nick France.\"Fostering collaboration among government agencies and cybersecurity experts is essential for a coordinated response to emerging threats,\" he said.As the election draws near, vigilance and proactive cybersecurity practices will be crucial in maintaining the integrity of the voting process.",

    "title": "TV News' Big Squeeze: Suddenly, Local and National Anchors All Play for Same Team, Stream and Screen",
    "content": "Fox Deportes, Telemundo to Team Up for Spanish-Language Super Bowl LIX Telecasts 1 day agoIn a bid to examine the difficulties Americans face in getting their hands on lifesaving drug narcan, NBC News in February turned to what would once be seen as an unlikely resource: reporters at many of its parent company's local stations.Over a three-week period, correspondents from WBAL in Baltimore, WDAN in Dayton, Ohio and WOWT in Omaha, among others, visited 64 drugstores in 15 states and Washington, D.C., all to determine whether the nasal spray that can help reverse the effects of an opioid overdose could be found easily by those who might desperately need it.Such cooperation \"is definitely a cultural change\" in relations between a media company's local and national news operations, says Valari Staab, the chairman of NBCUniversal's local stations, adding: \"In the past, the networks and stations have missed some real opportunities.\"With new economic pressures weighing on the media sector -- and the TV-news businesses they power -- national and local TV journalists may be working together even more closely than the ones at NBC. Paramount Global, Disney and NBCUniversal have all in recent years taken new steps to merge the business of their TV stations with that of their national newsgathering units. Such moves are quickly giving local reporters new opportunities to play on a bigger field while siphoning off some of the swagger from the national anchors and correspondents who have long stood at the top of the TV-news pecking order.With traditional ratings in decline and local ad dollars under pressure, there's little wonder that it's time to reorganize the troops. \"There's a massive focus on finding efficiencies,\" at media conglomerates, says John Harrison, leader of the Americas media and entertainment practice at EY.Indeed, in recent weeks, both ABC News and CBS News have cut staff, including popular anchors such as Jeff Glor, the co-anchor of CBS' Saturday-morning news program. Eventually, Harrison believes, the companies may rely on local reporters to dig up colorful details on the ground and tap national journalists to synthesize such color into a story that has resonance for broader audiences. The resulting story can be used in both local and national outlets.Local correspondents are popping up in unexpected places. \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" long a bastion for familiar contributors such as Mo Rocca and Lee Cowan, recently featured a report from Jennifer Mayerle of WCCO in Minneapolis, who visited the Greyhound Bus Museum in Hibbing, Minnesota. In the past, an appearance by a reporter from a local CBS station on the program has been exceedingly rare, according to a person familiar with the matter. NBC News, meanwhile, incorporated Jonathan Dienst, a veteran investigative correspondent for New York's WNBC, into special reports on the recent hush-money trial of former President Donald Trump. Dienst has contributed to the national news unit for years, but \"we began incorporating him more into specials on Trump reporting in ways we didn't previously,\" says Rebecca Blumenstein, president of editorial for NBC News, who works with Staab, the stations' chairman.While top network anchors like George Stephanopoulos, Lester Holt and Gayle King are treated like celebrities -- and typically make bigger salaries than many others -- executives believe viewers see little distinction between the anchors who lead national evening and morning news programs and their local counterparts.Audiences who watch New York's WABC, for example see \"no difference from  Robin Roberts to  Sade Baderinwa,\" says Debra OConnell, president of Disney Entertainment's News Group and Networks. \"They are, from a viewer perspective, one team.\" Indeed, Baderinwa in late August filled in on late-summer broadcasts of \"GMA.\"CBS News is testing the theory even more aggressively. After the 2024 presidential election, a new \"CBS Evening News\" will launch that is co-anchored by John Dickerson, a veteran CBS News anchor who specializes in politics, and Maurice DuBois, a king of the New York City news set who has anchored newscasts at the New York station WCBS for years. Lonnie Quinn, the WCBS weather reporter, will also play a sizable role.Yet viewers who have become accustomed to seeing an evening-news anchor jet off to trouble spots around the world may be in for a surprise should they tune in to the new program. \"It's all about who is the best possible person to be in Maui, to be in Israel, to be in Ukraine, and having that person be there, right?\" says Wendy McMahon, president and CEO of CBS' national news, local stations and syndication businesses. \"There could be times when - guess what? - it's a great political story and there's no one stronger than John Dickerson, or there's a huge story in New York and it makes sense for Maurice to be on there,\" she says. But a reporter at a CBS station in Denver or Pittsburgh might be the most knowledgeable operative for events that occur in those areas. \"We are always going to ask that question first: Who can do the very best job in service to our viewers, versus the optics of playing television?\" adds McMahon.During her tenure, McMahon overhauled CBS News in ways her predecessors might not have contemplated. Journalists at CBS News have been told that they are expected to contribute to all the unit's news operations, not just programs like \"CBS Mornings\" and \"CBS Evening News,\" says a person familiar with the business. National newsgathering has been put under the aegis of Adreinne Roark, an executive with experience primarily tied to management of local stations. The signature program on the company's live-streaming service is a so-called \"whip-around program\" that takes viewers to news stories bubbling up in regions around CBS' stations. The format relies in part on local- station personnel. A new unit devoted to news about health and wellness relies not only on Dr. Jon LaPook, CBS News' chief medical correspondent, but Stephanie Stahl, a medical reporter based at Philadelphia's KYW.Putting journalists from stations and CBS News together \"drives reach, drives impact, but also enables us to be really smart about, operationally, how we work together from an effectiveness perspective and an efficiency perspective,\" says McMahon.The strategy has drawn some scrutiny in recent days, with the national CBS News arm involved in a handful of gaffes. The Paramount Global unit addressed an eyebrow-raising interview between \"CBS Mornings\" co-anchor Tony Dokoupil and author Ta-Nehisi Coates during which Dokoupil suggested the author's book, \"The Message,\" which examines the state of relations between Israel and Palestinians \"would not be out of place in the backpack of an extremist.\" CBS News staffers were told the interview did not meet the unit's editorial standards, a decision that has drawn backlash. CBS News has also had to contend with questions about the recent interview of Vice President Kamala Harris on \"60 Minutes' after the candidate's response to a question from interviewer Bill Whitaker appeared to be different in a promo for the show than it was on the actual broadcast. It is not uncommon for news networks to edit segments for time constraints, and promos are typically much shorter than a full segment of content.\"Wendy is an outstanding, accomplished leader,\" said George Cheeks, the Paramount co-CEO who oversees CBS in a recent statement following the revelation of scrutiny around Dokoupil's interview. \"She and her leadership team are passionate advocates and stewards for CBS News standards; that won't change.\"None of those controversies lessens the pressure to consolidate forces. News at ABC, NBC and CBS once thrived on having only limited contact with viewers each day -- chiefly in the hours before the audience went to school or work, a few minutes in the evening, and another visit on Sunday. Now, all three networks are trying to set up 24/7 streaming hubs to fuel the broadband fortunes of their parents Paramount Global, Comcast and Disney. Suddenly, there's a need for fresh content across most of the day, not just a few parts of it.And in an era when more Americans are inclined to distrust traditional media, local journalists still command favor. Pew Research Center found in May that 71% of Americans feel local journalists cover the news accurately and 68% feel local media covers the most important stories and issues. A 2022 study by the same organization, however, revealed that half of U.S. adults believe that news organizations in general do a good job of covering the most important stories, report the news accurately and serve as a watchdog over elected leaders.In the past, a journalist who wanted to ply the trade on TV would have to start out at a small local station, work to a larger market, and then try to jump to a network. But the rise of streaming and tougher economics are making both sides part of the same team. Perhaps they should have been all along, suggests Andrew Heyward, a former CBS News president who studies the future of local journalism at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism at Arizona State University. \"To some degree, divisions over the years between network and local were artificial., It's based on someone's ego or corporate infrastructure or leadership teams,\" he says. From a journalism perspective, he adds, bringing the forces together \"makes a lot of sense.\"Besides, local stations have grown more ambitious in the streaming era, taking on projects that resemble those of national counterparts. \"I think the tired image of local news just doing fires and crime news is really out of date,\" says Heyward. \"Local stations are much more focused on enterprise reporting, and they are in a more competitive environment.\"The big media companies are putting new bets on local at a time when some important partners are not. Advertisers are seen putting their dollars elsewhere in months to come, particularly as streaming outlets like Hulu and Max make new outreach to small and regional marketers. \"We expect the two primary contributors of local TV broadcasters' revenue -- retransmission and core advertising -- will modestly decline over the next few years,\" says Rose Oberman, media and entertainment director for S&P Global Ratings, in a recent research note.One recent effort to fuse local stations and national reporting failed. E.W. Scripps in September said it would cut 200 jobs and scrap Scripps News, which distributed national news programming across the company's local stations and via streaming. \"Amidst an already difficult linear television advertising marketplace, many brands and agencies have decided that advertising around national news is just too risky for them given the polarized nature of this country, no matter the accolades and credentials a news organization like Scripps receives for its objectivity,\" said Adam Symons, Scripps' CEO, in a statement at the time. \"I vehemently disagree, but it is hurting Scripps News, along with every other national linear and digital news outlet.\"Using local reporters may add new qualities to the networks' national product, says Heyward. \"It's going to make the coverage more varied and less of that parachute-jump-in\" style that has a national correspondent fly into a place with which they are not familiar.Both ABC and CBS expect to add more original hours of programming to their streaming outlets, according to OConnell and McMahon, moves that are likely to accelerate the need for personnel. McMahon's willingness to weave local newsrooms into national news concepts is well documented, but OConnell keeps future strategic notions closer to the vest. The company has for years used some personnel for both local and national purposes, she says, as it has with Sam Champion, the popular weather journalist who works for WABC but makes appearances on national programs. Could some popular ABC News programs benefit from more faces from stations?\" We get our report card every day and our viewers are telling us what they prefer,\" she says. \"That's what we focus on.\"Tapping local newsrooms helps \"to double our resources and our reach,\" says NBC's Blumenstein, and the local touches the journalists bring make the reports \"feel very unique.\" The work to develop more connections between NBC News and local stations, she says, is \"just at the early stages here.\"",

    "title": "Trump again asks appeals court to move New York hush money case to federal court",
    "content": "(NEW YORK) -- Former President Donald Trump has again asked an appeals court to transfer his New York criminal hush money case to federal court, reigniting an effort to stall his sentencing or throw out his conviction on 34 felony courts.In a filing on late Monday, Trump's lawyers asked the New York-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to reconsider a lower court's September decision denying the former president's attempt to remove the state case to federal court.Defense lawyers argued in the filing that the jury in the case improperly saw evidence of Trump's official acts as president which would have been protected by the Supreme Court's July ruling on presidential immunity.\"This case presents complex first-impression issues relating to the Supremacy Clause, federal-officer removal, appearances of impropriety and conflicts in connection with an unprecedented and baseless prosecution of the leading candidate in the 2024 Presidential election, and the ability of future Presidents to serve the American people without fear of reprisal from hostile local officials,\" lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove wrote in the 99-page filing.Trump was found guilty in May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in order to boost his electoral prospects in the 2016 presidential election.In July, the Supreme Court ruled in a blockbuster decision that Trump is entitled to immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts undertaken while in office.Criminal or civil cases against federal officials can be removed to federal court if the officials can prove the case centers on official conduct. When Trump sought to remove his hush money case to federal court in 2023 by arguing that the allegations related to his official acts as president, U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein denied the move, writing that \"hush money paid to an adult film star is not related to a President's official acts.\"Judge Hellerstein then denied Trump's request to reconsider his decision in September, as Trump was seeking to delay his sentencing, because the former president failed to show \"good cause\" for why the issue should be examined again.\"Nothing in the Supreme Court's opinion affects my previous conclusion that the hush money payments were private, unofficial acts, outside the bounds of executive authority,\" Judge Hellerstein wrote.Trump is now appealing Hellerstein's September decision, which defense lawyers argue relied on a \"profoundly flawed analysis.\"Trump is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 26, after the New York judge overseeing the case, Juan Merchan, granted Trump's request to delay sentencing until after the November election.In their filing Monday, Trump's lawyers also aired grievances about an alleged conflict of interest by Judge Merchan and political motivations of the prosecutors, writing that witnesses \"concocted the type of false and implausible story President Trump's political opponents wanted to hear.\"If the effort to remove the case to federal court is successful, it could give Trump the authority to kill the prosecution if he is elected to the presidency in November. Unlike his federal criminal cases, Trump is unable to direct the prosecution or pardon himself if the case remains in state court.The removal attempt could also impact the timing of Trump's Nov. 26 sentencing if the motion remains unresolved by then.Separately, Judge Merchan is expected to issue a ruling on Trump's effort to throw out the conviction based on presidential immunity by Nov. 12.",

    "content": "The biggest banks staged a broad Wall Street rebound in the third quarter, as corporate clients got more comfortable issuing new debt and pursuing mergers while some traders recorded one of their best quarters in years.Goldman Sachs (GS) said Tuesday that its investment-banking fees were up 20% from the year-ago period. Bank of America reported its highest third-quarter trading revenue in more than a decade. And Citigroup's investment-banking fees were up 44%.Executives at these banks are optimistic that the start of an interest rate-cutting cycle at the Federal Reserve -- which last month reduced its benchmark rate by 50 basis points -- will mean more deals in the near future.\"My recent conversations with clients have been quite constructive,\" Goldman CEO David Solomon told analysts Tuesday. \"The beginning of the rate cut cycle has renewed optimism for a soft landing, which should spur increased economic activity.\"CEO Jane Fraser said in a statement that \"in a pivotal year, this quarter contains multiple proof points that we are moving in the right direction.\"Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan touted \"year-over-year growth in investment banking and asset management fees, as well as sales and trading revenue.\"Combined investment banking fees at Goldman, Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which reported its results last week, were $6.5 billion. That amounted to a 27% rise from a year earlier and 1% increase from the last quarter.Combined trading revenue for those same Wall Street giants was $23.4 billion, a 6% increase from a year earlier and a 3% increase sequentially.Another big Wall Street player, Morgan Stanley (MS), releases its third-quarter earnings Wednesday.The results thus far offer the latest sign that a two-year-long dealmaking drought appears to be ending, helping banks to cushion uneven results in their consumer operations. Overall profits at Bank of America and Citigroup fell when compared to the year-earlier period.Certainly there are some uncertainties that could upend that optimism, including unrest in the Middle East and the outcome of the 2024 US Presidential election in November.\"The big unknown, or the big factor that's out there remains, you know, more of the geopolitical issues, but also what happens with the US election, and we'll kind of have to see how that plays out,\" said Citigroup Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason.Goldman finds itself in a much stronger position than it was a year ago when its CEO was grappling with a slump in dealmaking, the costly exit from consumer lending, and a series of high-profile departures from the firm.Investment banking fees were $1.8 billion, up 20% from the year-ago period, as companies issued more debt and equity. Even its advisory fees were up slightly thanks to a revival in mergers and acquisitions.Goldman's trading revenue rose 2% year over year, driven primarily by a strong performance from its equities traders, while asset and wealth management revenue increased 16%.Fixed-income trading did not do as well. Revenues from that unit were down.Goldman's stock is up this year more than any of its other big-bank rivals. It was roughly flat in Tuesday morning trading.Bank of America also outperformed expectations for its Wall Street operations, as revenue from trading rose 12% and revenue from equity and debt issuance increased 16% and 37%, respectively.The bank's sales and trading revenue was up for its 10th consecutive quarter and reported its highest third quarter performance in more than a decade.\"For our clients, and whether that's institutional or individual investors, things feel pretty, pretty reasonable,\" Jim DeMare, president of Bank of America global markets business, told Yahoo Finance.\"The US economy has been surprisingly resistant, meaning a hard landing seems to be not a topic today and a soft landing with some kind of leaning towards a no-landing seems to be becoming popular,\" he added.Investment banking was definitely a bright spot for Citigroup, which helped the lender post a smaller-than-expected profit drop in the third quarter. Net income fell to $3.2 billion from $3.5 billion a year ago.Like Goldman, it did well in equities trading but trading of bonds fell.Its stock fell by more than 2% in Tuesday morning trading.\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.",

If using Siri, Alexa, or another voice-activated device, ask it to translate this article into your preferred language.In an effort to make every vote count, some areas in metro Atlanta are providing ballots in languages other than English. This story will cover metro Atlanta counties offering election materials in different languages. However, voters should note that some cities have decided to offer their election materials in various languages, too.During local elections, people can check with city officials to see if sample ballots and other election materials would be provided in different languages.RELATED: 11Alive 2024 election county-by-county voter guide | Fulton, Gwinnett, DeKalb, Cobb and ClaytonUnder the Voting Rights Act, Gwinnett County is federally obligated to provide election materials in Spanish.The law, known as Section 203, mandates that a county provide voting materials in a language other than English when at least 5% of the community's voting-age population speaks another language. Gwinnett County's Spanish-speaking population is the only community in the state that reaches this threshold.However, in 2021, Gwinnett County officials made a commitment and later included it in their budget to offer election materials in more languages.Deeming it an effort of language equity, Gwinnett County also offers election materials in the following languages:Click here to view the consolidated sample ballots for the General Election on Nov. 5 in Gwinnett County. You can view the ballot in Spanish online here and the ballot in Korean, Chinese and Vietnamese by clicking here.According to the Supervisor of Elections Office, ballots will only be offered in English and Spanish. After inserting their voter access card, voters can select their preferred language on the ballot marking device.DeKalb County in 2020 became the first Georgia county to translate voter materials in Spanish and Korean voluntarily.The DeKalb County Supervisor of Elections Office continues this effort by providing election materials in four languages:This is when voters can rely on a poll worker.Counties are encouraged to hire bilingual poll workers who are equipped and allowed to assist voters through the voting process. If voters need assistance, they are encouraged to ask a poll worker to explain the steps necessary to cast a ballot at their precinct.Another tip is to check out your sample ballot by going to the Secretary of State's Office and the My Voter Page section.

    "content": "Jonathan Alpert is a psychotherapist who practices in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Among his patients, he's seeing election-related anxiety tied to the race between Harris and Trump. Alpert told BI that some of his patients are backing Trump but are reluctant to tell others.This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Jonathan Alpert -- a psychotherapist and the author of \"Be Fearless: Change Your Life in 28 Days\" -- who is seeing an uptick in anxiety among his patients regarding the 2024 presidential election. Alpert is licensed to practice in New York, Washington, D.C., Connecticut, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, so some of his patients live in hotly-contested communities in the Philadelphia and Erie areas. This year, he's hearing a range of concerns from his patients regarding both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. And even though Trump has been in the public eye as a politician for nearly a decade, Alpert said that some of patients remain \"shy\" Trump voters, or voters who are afraid to reveal that they're supporting the former president for myriad reasons.This essay has been edited for length and clarity.With this election there seems to be even more polarization than in years past, even more misinformation, and lots of uncertainty in our society. This uncertainty leads to instability and fear about the future, resulting in heightened anxiety over who is elected the next leader.Furthermore, previous election controversies are leading to a lingering sense of unease. Many people feel that the election could lead to significant social upheaval or regression. There's also a contagion effect that cannot be ignored. Social circles, family dynamics, and online communities have created tribalism and a subsequent division in our society leading to more widespread feelings of anxiety.Some patients 'aren't happy' about Harris' ascension or Trump's candidacyAdd into the mix the de facto nomination of Harris following  Joe Biden dropping out of the race. Many people, although they are Democrats, aren't happy about the way in which Harris became the nominee and have their reservations about voting for her. They talk to me about their lessening by the day confidence in her abilities to lead and are concerned about her lack of depth and substance when asked benign questions about her policies.As for Trump, a significant source of peoples' anxiety around him stems from disbelief that someone they view as a bully could gain such popularity. We're not taught that meanness is a path to success, yet Trump's divisiveness resonates with many, suggesting a hunger for change. Whether loved or hated, Trump gives voice to many who feel unheard. This is what worked for him in 2016 and what he is aiming for in 2024.'I'm seeing a lot of shy or closeted Trump voters'These are people who have positive feelings towards Trump and favor his policies over those of Harris yet are not comfortable coming out with their choice to friends, family, or romantic partners. I see this play out in the lives of many of my patients.For some, they talk about assumptions made by others about their political affiliation. One patient talked to me about how everyone in her cooking class just assumes she is a liberal and hates Trump. In fact, she is not a liberal and doesn't hate Trump. She supports him. She sits in silence as the rest of the class bitches about Trump.Another patient talked about how he can't discuss with friends his frustration about the student-loan forgiveness program that he feels he shouldn't support since he didn't go to college. Any attempt he makes at having a reasonable conversation about this is quickly shot down and he is labeled a \"MAGA Republican.\" Truth is, he's a moderate Republican and works two jobs to make ends meet to support his family.There are many similar stories I've heard over the past few months. The result: These folks are overwhelmingly keeping quiet about their political beliefs and voting plans for the upcoming election and are closeted Trump supporters.What drives the 'shy' Trump voter phenomenon?For some, publicly supporting Trump could invite criticism or ostracism from friends, family, or colleagues who hold opposing views. These people fear judgment or social consequences, and this leads them to conceal their political beliefs.For many people, their political beliefs are often tied to personal identity. For closeted Trump supporters, maintaining a positive social image or protecting their personal and professional relationships can be a stronger motivator than expressing their true beliefs. People may feel torn between their personal beliefs and the need to conform to social norms or expectations.But by keeping political beliefs hidden, it can affect personal relationships. This secrecy can lead to a lack of genuine communication and potentially strain relationships with those who might be surprised or bothered if they discover their true beliefs later.A need to stop 'unhealthy thinking'My hope is that we can get to a place where Democrats and Republicans can be friends again and enjoy a dinner together despite their political differences. There was once a time when politicians duked it out in the halls of Congress but could leave it there.Many people yearn for the days of old such as when politicians like  John McCain and Biden -- who had entirely different political ideas -- were friends. People are longing for a time when being on different sides of the political aisle doesn't preclude you from being friends with someone. Demonizing someone just because they're from the opposing party is about as senseless and unhealthy as thinking \"all white people are privileged\" or \"all cops are bad.\" Statements such as these only add to the poisonous well of unhealthy thinking and anxiety that is so abundant in our society.Read the original article on Business Insider",

    "title": "Flood of Election-Related Cyber Activity Unleashed",
    "content": "Cyber-threat actors have ramped up their targeting of the 2024 US elections with a flood of malicious activity expected to peak over the next month, aimed at causing disruption to voters and the election process and requiring increased vigilance on the part of stakeholders.Specifically, attackers have bolstered election-related threat activity since the beginning of the year with an increase in the sale of phishing kits targeting US voters and campaign donors; the registration of more than 1,000 domains aimed at exploiting election-related content for malicious purposes; and increased ransomware activity targeting government entities, according to research from FortiGuard Labs Threat Research released today.Since the inception of Internet-related threats, cyber-threat actors have typically increased malicious activity ahead of elections, notes Derek Manky, chief security strategist and vice president of global threat intelligence at Fortinet. However, they aim to be especially disruptive during the current election cycle, requiring that all stakeholders be prepared to fend off malicious actors in the upcoming weeks to protect election outcomes.\"As the 2024 US presidential election approaches, it's critical to recognize and understand the cyber threats that may impact the integrity and trustworthiness of the election process and the welfare of the participating citizens,\" he says.Indeed, separate research has found that adversaries from Russia, China, and Iran in particular have been using cyber operations to stoke discord and influence election outcomes rather than make direct attacks on voting machines or other voter infrastructure. These more insidious tactics require a different type of vigilance on the part of defenders, the researchers noted.FortiGuard Labs' latest election-threat research is the result of analysis of threats gathered from January 2024 to August 2024 that may affect US-based entities and the electoral process. The researchers discovered several key areas of threat activity that have been on the rise.One is a significant increase in the availability of affordable phishing kits on the Dark Web designed to target voters and donors by impersonating the presidential candidates and their campaigns. Specifically, the researchers found kits for $1,260 created to impersonate US presidential candidates and to harvest personal information, including names, addresses, and credit card details.Part of the phishing activity around the current election cycle also includes an increase of highly convincing mobile scams that use phone calls, voicemails, or messaging services that leverage deepfake technology to spread misinformation, which can affect voter outcomes, notes Alex Quilici, CEO at YouMail.\"AI can now create highly convincing voice attacks that make it sound like a trusted figure, such as a candidate, urging you not to vote or spreading false information,\" he says. \"This kind of deception can seriously undermine public trust and disrupt the electoral process.\"Attackers also have registered more than 1,000 new potentially malicious domains since the beginning of 2024 that incorporate election-related content and candidates to lure unsuspecting targets and potentially conduct nefarious activities, the researchers noted. The two most-used hosting providers for these election-themed websites are AMAZON-02 and CLOUDFLARENET, demonstrating that attackers are leveraging known, reputable services to bolster the legitimacy of malicious domains.Another way cyberattackers can spread misinformation and disrupt the democratic process is through the use of people's personal information to directly target them, the researchers noted. Fortinet found that there currently is an abundance of this type of material on the Dark Web, with more than 1.3 billion rows of combo lists -- which include usernames, email addresses, and passwords -- of US citizens for sale for nefarious use.The availability of this data poses a considerable risk for credential-stuffing attacks that allow cybercriminals to gain unauthorized access to people's accounts. Overall, the availability of so much personal data of various election stakeholders creates potential indirect disruption in the voting process, notes Casey Ellis, founder and chief strategy officer at Bugcrowd.\"While it may be difficult to use these records to commit the kind of fraud or attacks that would directly modify the outcome of an election, it's certainly a cheap and simple exercise to simply highlight the possibility of their use as a way to instill distrust in the democratic process, and to potential affect and manipulate voter turnout,\" he says.FortiGuard Labs researchers also noted a 28% increase in ransomware attacks against the US government year-over-year based on observed leak sites. This type of activity also can threaten the integrity of the election process by undermining citizens' trust in the ability of the government to protect the personal data they collect from them.To ensure the US presidential election process runs smoothly for all that wish to participate, Fortinet offered some recommendations to prevent and mitigate attacks between now and election day. The researchers advised that individuals and organizations alike always remain vigilant for suspicious behavior or activity leading up to major election-related events and prioritize good cyber hygiene in general to reduce potential threats.Organizations, especially those related to the election or government agencies, should prioritize employee training and awareness about the cyber threats that exist that aim to disrupt the election process. Enforcing multifactor authentication and a strong password policy across both individuals' and organizations' online accounts also can protect against intrusion.Finally, any organization with a stake in the election also should install endpoint protection solutions, patch operating systems and Web servers, and update software regularly to ensure systems are as secure as possible, Fortinet recommended.",

    "content": "This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.Construction has an open secret when it comes to the number of workers lacking permanent legal status on jobsites.Immigrants entering the country illegally make up about 23% of the construction laborer workforce in the United States, according to a 2021 report from the Center for American Progress. A Pew Research Center study pegged that share at 15% for all workers in construction jobs.Those numbers underpin a tension in the construction sector where an industry that's starving for help sometimes rolls out the welcome mat to workers lacking the status to work in the country legally. Doing so can give contractors who are willing to look the other way a leg up on the competition, but it also opens the door to abuses by employers.\"Nobody benefits from having a large pool of undocumented workers in the construction industry,\" said Brian Turmail, vice president of public affairs and workforce at Associated General Contractors of America. \"It becomes too easy for those workers to be exploited by unscrupulous contractors who then underbid responsible contractors.\"As the 2024 presidential election draws near, the issue has taken on even more importance for construction executives looking for a way to legally expand their workforces.The construction industry will need to bring in nearly 454,000 new workers in 2025 on top of normal hiring trends to meet industry demand, according to Associated Builders and Contractors. That estimate also presumes construction spending growth slows significantly next year, even though other data indicates nonresidential construction planning should accelerate by mid-2025.For that reason, construction trade organizations continue to advocate for meaningful reform to the current immigration system. That means pushing for more programs to allow workers to lawfully enter the country and work in construction, said Anirban Basu, ABC chief economist.\"If we can figure out a way to deal with these 11  or 12 million undocumented migrants -- is there a pathway to, if not citizenship, at least a work visa? Can we bring them out of the shadows?\" said Basu. \"Can they be employed by a contractor without fear of penalty, either for the employee or the employer?\"One of those reforms is to raise the current cap of 66,000 visas issued annually under the H-2B visa program, said Kristen Swearingen, ABC vice president of legislative and political affairs.The H-2B visa program provides temporary foreign workers to industries like construction, helping to address labor shortages.\"Commonsense solutions to address the 12 million undocumented immigrants in the United States include expansion of H-2B visa and reforms to the overall program,\" said Swearingen. \"Currently, the H-2B cap is too low to meaningfully improve the massive shortage of workers in construction and other industries, and that cap should be based on economic need.\"In terms of the presidential election, both candidates have pledged to decrease illegal crossings at the border. But when it comes to making it easier for foreign-born nationals to immigrate legally for work, each has taken a different stance.Vice President Kamala Harris, if elected, is likely to continue the Biden administration's approach to expanding legal immigration pathways such as the H-2B visa program, said L.J. D'Arrigo, partner and leader of the immigration practice at Harris Beach, a Rochester, New York-based law firm.During Harris' time as vice president, the Department of Homeland Security announced a record allocation of 20,000 H-2B temporary nonagricultural workers visas for citizens of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Haiti, as part of almost 65,000 supplemental H-2B visas made available for fiscal year 2023.\"I think it's clearer to project what would happen under a Harris administration. I would expect that there would be at least a status quo in terms of H-2B visa allocation and availability,\" said D'Arrigo. \"Although Trump personally uses the H-2B visa program for his businesses, it's less clear on how he will approach the H-2B visa program based on his history of restricting legal immigration.\"During his administration, President Donald Trump nearly doubled the number of H-2B visas available in 2019. However, in June 2020, his administration suspended the program, saying it was to protect U.S. workers from job competition due to the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\"Little has been reported on what Trump's policy will likely be on 'legal immigration' in a second Trump term,\" said D'Arrigo. \"We have the benefit of forecasting what Trump immigration may look like in 2025 through the lens of Trump's prior administration. Under his administration, we witnessed a record-breaking number of visa denials, leaving U.S. businesses without the talent they need to succeed in a globally competitive economy.\"In addition to significant expansion to the H-2B visa program, AGC has asked Congress to enact legislation authorizing both the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and Temporary Protected Status programs.DACA grants deportation relief and work permits to young immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, often referred to as \"Dreamers.\" Trump attempted to end the DACA program in 2020, but Congress blocked the move. If re-elected, Trump will likely seek to end DACA again, said D'Arrigo.TPS provides temporary legal status to immigrants from countries under crisis. Trump would likely seek to roll back TPS designations as well.On the other hand, D'Arrigo anticipates a Harris administration to make DACA a high priority, as it has been for Biden's immigration policy.But just increasing the number of workers in the U.S. isn't enough to solve the issue for construction, said Basu.Opponents of immigration reform say bringing in more workers would reduce wages, according to the Center for Immigration Studies. However, for Basu, the key challenge remains finding workers with the specialized skills.\"I don't talk about worker shortages so much because I don't think it's really about a worker shortage,\" said Basu. \"It's about a skills shortage, a skilled worker shortage.\"Many of the people coming across the border lack the refined skill sets needed for the types of equipment, technologies and processes used in the U.S. construction industry, said Basu. So, while the influx of workers can help fill gaps in the short term, it does not address the core issue of specialized training.AGC is engaged with U.S. Reps. Morgan Luttrell, R-Texas, and Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., to craft bipartisan legislation to address a range of immigration and work authorization programs.AGC suggests doubling the funding for the Perkins Act, a federal funding program that supports career-technical education, and to boost federal post-secondary funding for construction education and training programs. Federal officials currently put about 80% of post-secondary funding into four-year degree programs even though only 38% of Americans will earn such a degree, said Turmail.Basu also highlighted the need to retain skilled foreign talent. He questions the logic of sending back talented individuals trained in U.S. universities to their home countries, arguing if they are \"gifted in science, technology, engineering or math, we need them here.\"\"There are a ton of kids coming from India, China and elsewhere to our world-class colleges and universities  They get their STEM degree, and then what do we do? We send them back to Seoul, Beijing, Delhi, Baku, or wherever it happens to be,\" said Basu. \"That is silly. I've said many times, let's build a wall to keep those people in.\"Improvements to training and comprehensive immigration reform remain equally critical to fix the workforce issue, according to AGC. Turmail highlights the need for both better border security and a legal pathway for immigrants already in the industry.",

    "content": "The film's social media team's response came after the Republican presidential candidate posted criticism of the movie on his social media platform Truth Social, alleging that the movie is defamatory and accusing the team of trying to hurt his chances to win the presidency.Newsweek reached out to the Trump campaign for comment via email outside of business hours.In his post, Trump wrote, \"A FAKE and CLASSLESS Movie written about me, called, The Apprentice (Do they even have the right to use that name without approval?), will hopefully 'bomb.\"He continued, \"It's a cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election, to try and hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country, 'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!'\"Trump continued to voice his disapproval of the way in which the film depicts his relationship with his first wife, the late Ivana Trump, and criticized the screenwriter, political journalist and author Gabe Sherman, calling him a \"lowlife and talentless hack.\"Director Ali Abbasi also responded to Trump's post on X and wrote, \"Thanks for getting back to us @realDonaldTrump. I am available to talk further if you want. Today is a tight day w a lot of press for #TheApprentice but i might be able to give you a call tomorrow.\"The Apprentice, written by Sherman purportedly based on \"records of real events\" and directed by Abbasi, was released on October 11 and stars Sebastian Stan as Trump, Jeremy Strong as Roy Cohn, Maria Bakalova as Ivana Trump, and more.The film, with a $16 million budget, focuses on Trump's life in New York in the 1970s and 1980s, and highlights his relationships with his lawyer Cohn and his first wife, according to Forbes.In a previous statement to Newsweek, Trump's campaign communications director Steven Cheung said, \"The filmmakers now readily admit they fabricated scenes and created fake stories to fit some deranged narrative about President Trump that is completely untrue. This garbage is pure fiction which sensationalizes lies that have been long debunked.\"He continued, \"This 'film' is pure malicious defamation, should never see the light of day, and doesn't even deserve a place in the straight-to-DVD section of a bargain bin at a soon-to-be-closed discount movie store, it belongs in a dumpster fire.\"Cheung told Variety in May that the campaign would be filing a lawsuit against the movie, following a previous lawsuit against the film from investor Dan Snyder, who objected to the film's portrayal of Trump.While speaking to the Associated Press about a potential Trump lawsuit, Abbasi said, \"I don't think they have a case. So now I'm back safe in Europe, now they can bring it on. I'm not afraid anymore.\"Although the film has received praise on X and a rating of 79 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, it has not been so successful at the box office.The film opened in the box office in 10th place, making $1.6 million in ticket sales, which is low in comparison to other newly released films including Terrifier 3, The Wild Robot, Joker: Folie à Deux, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, and more.",

    "content": "(NEW YORK) -- Former President Donald Trump has again asked an appeals court to transfer his New York criminal hush money case to federal court, reigniting an effort to stall his sentencing or throw out his conviction on 34 felony courts.In a filing on late Monday, Trump's lawyers asked the New York-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to reconsider a lower court's September decision denying the former president's attempt to remove the state case to federal court.Defense lawyers argued in the filing that the jury in the case improperly saw evidence of Trump's official acts as president which would have been protected by the Supreme Court's July ruling on presidential immunity.\"This case presents complex first-impression issues relating to the Supremacy Clause, federal-officer removal, appearances of impropriety and conflicts in connection with an unprecedented and baseless prosecution of the leading candidate in the 2024 Presidential election, and the ability of future Presidents to serve the American people without fear of reprisal from hostile local officials,\" lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove wrote in the 99-page filing.Trump was found guilty in May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in order to boost his electoral prospects in the 2016 presidential election.In July, the Supreme Court ruled in a blockbuster decision that Trump is entitled to immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts undertaken while in office.Criminal or civil cases against federal officials can be removed to federal court if the officials can prove the case centers on official conduct. When Trump sought to remove his hush money case to federal court in 2023 by arguing that the allegations related to his official acts as president, U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein denied the move, writing that \"hush money paid to an adult film star is not related to a President's official acts.\"Judge Hellerstein then denied Trump's request to reconsider his decision in September, as Trump was seeking to delay his sentencing, because the former president failed to show \"good cause\" for why the issue should be examined again.\"Nothing in the Supreme Court's opinion affects my previous conclusion that the hush money payments were private, unofficial acts, outside the bounds of executive authority,\" Judge Hellerstein wrote.Trump is now appealing Hellerstein's September decision, which defense lawyers argue relied on a \"profoundly flawed analysis.\"Trump is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 26, after the New York judge overseeing the case, Juan Merchan, granted Trump's request to delay sentencing until after the November election.In their filing Monday, Trump's lawyers also aired grievances about an alleged conflict of interest by Judge Merchan and political motivations of the prosecutors, writing that witnesses \"concocted the type of false and implausible story President Trump's political opponents wanted to hear.\"If the effort to remove the case to federal court is successful, it could give Trump the authority to kill the prosecution if he is elected to the presidency in November. Unlike his federal criminal cases, Trump is unable to direct the prosecution or pardon himself if the case remains in state court.The removal attempt could also impact the timing of Trump's Nov. 26 sentencing if the motion remains unresolved by then.Separately, Judge Merchan is expected to issue a ruling on Trump's effort to throw out the conviction based on presidential immunity by Nov. 12.",

    "title": "CNN Senior Data Reporter: 'This Is What Gives Democrats Agita' [WATCH]",
    "content": "CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten raised concerns Monday over Kamala Harris' polling averages in critical battleground states, noting they are trailing significantly compared to Democratic candidates in previous election cycles.During an appearance on \"The Lead with Jake Tapper,\" Enten highlighted Harris' slipping support in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, three states that have played decisive roles in past presidential elections.Enten reported that Harris' leads in those three states have narrowed to just a single percentage point as of October, down from a 2-point advantage in September.Trump Fighting For America Collectable Gold Coin - Fight! - Must SeeThese numbers stand in stark contrast to the stronger leads held by both Joe Biden and former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at the same point in previous elections.On October 14 of both 2016 and 2020, Biden and Clinton were each leading in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin by an average of 8 points, according to Enten.\"I have never seen such consistently tight polling such as this across the battleground states in all the time I have been looking and covering politics,\" Enten said during the segment. He warned that these slim leads are causing significant concern within the Democratic Party. \"It looks like Harris is slightly ahead, though well within the margin of error. But compared to where we were 4 years ago and 8 years ago, at this point Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, an average across all three,\" Enten explained, emphasizing the difference from past Democratic performances.Enten went on to reference how the 2020 election played out, reminding viewers that even though Biden was polling ahead by 8 points at this stage in the race, he ultimately won these states by much smaller margins.Hillary Clinton, despite holding a similar 8-point lead in 2016, lost all three states to Donald Trump.\"Harris is up by 1 point across the three states, but Biden was up by 8, and Clinton was up by 8. I don't have to tell you that Hillary Clinton lost all three of these states. Joe Biden barely won all three of these states,\" Enten said, underscoring the challenges Democrats face.He added, \"Democrats have to ask themselves at this particular point, can Harris actually hold on given that Joe Biden barely did, and Hillary Clinton did not?\"Polling data has shown a widening gap between the numbers and actual results on election day in these critical states.In Wisconsin, for example, a FiveThirtyEight poll in November 2020 showed Biden leading Trump by 8.4 points, but he only narrowly won the state by a margin of 49.6% to 48.9%.Similarly, in Michigan, polls indicated Biden had a near 8-point lead, but he ultimately won by just 3 points.In Pennsylvania, Biden won with 50% of the vote compared to Trump's 48.8%, despite polling showing him ahead by nearly 5 points.Enten also pointed to a troubling scenario for Democrats. According to his analysis, if Trump manages to outperform in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan by even 1 point over his previous performance, it could result in him securing a commanding 312 electoral votes.As Harris continues to campaign, the Democratic Party will be closely monitoring these polling numbers in the Great Lakes region.The results in these key battleground states are likely to be crucial in determining the outcome of the 2024 presidential election.The opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of Objectivist.

Specifics are to be determined by an internal audit. \"Based on its results, I believe that we'll be capable of meeting that 10-percent limit,\" he said. As for the report on the circumstances surrounding the May 15 assassination attempt against Prime Minister Robert Fico (Smer-SD), Sutaj Estok noted that it's being drafted by the Slovak Intelligence Service (SIS), he's not familiar with its details and has no access to the investigation file. \"The report is to be submitted to Parliament by the end of the year at the very latest,\" claimed the minister, who hopes that at least a part of it will be declassified for public. When asked about when the new House chair might be elected, a post that has been vacant since the 2024 presidential election in April due to internecine coalition disputes, Sutaj Estok replied that the coalition council is slated to discuss the issue before the parliamentary October session. mf",

    "content": "(NEW YORK) -- Former President Donald Trump has again asked an appeals court to transfer his New York criminal hush money case to federal court, reigniting an effort to stall his sentencing or throw out his conviction on 34 felony courts.In a filing on late Monday, Trump's lawyers asked the New York-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to reconsider a lower court's September decision denying the former president's attempt to remove the state case to federal court.Defense lawyers argued in the filing that the jury in the case improperly saw evidence of Trump's official acts as president which would have been protected by the Supreme Court's July ruling on presidential immunity.\"This case presents complex first-impression issues relating to the Supremacy Clause, federal-officer removal, appearances of impropriety and conflicts in connection with an unprecedented and baseless prosecution of the leading candidate in the 2024 Presidential election, and the ability of future Presidents to serve the American people without fear of reprisal from hostile local officials,\" lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove wrote in the 99-page filing.Trump was found guilty in May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in order to boost his electoral prospects in the 2016 presidential election.In July, the Supreme Court ruled in a blockbuster decision that Trump is entitled to immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts undertaken while in office.Criminal or civil cases against federal officials can be removed to federal court if the officials can prove the case centers on official conduct. When Trump sought to remove his hush money case to federal court in 2023 by arguing that the allegations related to his official acts as president, U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein denied the move, writing that \"hush money paid to an adult film star is not related to a President's official acts.\"Judge Hellerstein then denied Trump's request to reconsider his decision in September, as Trump was seeking to delay his sentencing, because the former president failed to show \"good cause\" for why the issue should be examined again.\"Nothing in the Supreme Court's opinion affects my previous conclusion that the hush money payments were private, unofficial acts, outside the bounds of executive authority,\" Judge Hellerstein wrote.Trump is now appealing Hellerstein's September decision, which defense lawyers argue relied on a \"profoundly flawed analysis.\"Trump is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 26, after the New York judge overseeing the case, Juan Merchan, granted Trump's request to delay sentencing until after the November election.In their filing Monday, Trump's lawyers also aired grievances about an alleged conflict of interest by Judge Merchan and political motivations of the prosecutors, writing that witnesses \"concocted the type of false and implausible story President Trump's political opponents wanted to hear.\"If the effort to remove the case to federal court is successful, it could give Trump the authority to kill the prosecution if he is elected to the presidency in November. Unlike his federal criminal cases, Trump is unable to direct the prosecution or pardon himself if the case remains in state court.The removal attempt could also impact the timing of Trump's Nov. 26 sentencing if the motion remains unresolved by then.Separately, Judge Merchan is expected to issue a ruling on Trump's effort to throw out the conviction based on presidential immunity by Nov. 12.",

    "content": "Fortinet® released its FortiGuard Labs Threat Intelligence Report: Threat Actors Targeting the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, which reveals and analyzes threats tied to U.S.-based entities, voters, and the electoral process. Key findings from the threat intelligence report include:* Phishing Scams Targeting Voters Leading Up to the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election: Threat actors are selling affordable phishing kits on the darknet designed to target voters and donors by impersonating the presidential candidates and their campaigns.* Malicious Domain Registrations on the Rise: More than 1,000 new potentially malicious domains have also been registered since the beginning of 2024 that follow particular patterns and incorporate election-related content and candidates, suggesting that threat actors are leveraging the heightened interest surrounding the election to lure unsuspecting targets and potentially conduct malicious activities.* Darknet Landscape: Billions of records from the U.S. are for sale on darknet forums, including Social Security numbers (SSNs), personally identifiable information (PII), and credentials that could be used in misinformation campaigns and lead to fraudulent activity, phishing scams, and account takeover; approximately 3% of the posts on darknet forums involve databases related to business and government entities.* Ransomware Landscape: FortiGuard Labs researchers noted a 28% increase in ransomware attacks against the U.S. government year-over-year based on observed leak sites.Derek Manky, Chief Security Strategist and VP of Global Threat Intelligence at Fortinet\"As the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches, it's critical to recognize and understand the cyberthreats that may impact the integrity and trustworthiness of the election process and the welfare of the participating citizens. Cyber adversaries, including state-sponsored actors and hacktivist groups, are increasingly active leading up to major events like elections. Remaining vigilant and identifying and analyzing potential cyberthreats and vulnerabilities is crucial for preparing and safeguarding against the lures and targeted cyberattacks that could take advantage of a heightened moment in time and even disrupt or influence electoral outcomes.\"Scams Targeting the U.S. 2024 Presidential Election Flood the DarknetCyber adversaries, including state-sponsored actors and hacktivist groups, are increasingly active in the lead-up to elections.The FortiGuard Labs research team observed threat actors selling distinct phishing kits for $1,260 each, created to impersonate U.S. presidential candidates. These kits are designed to harvest personal information, including names, addresses, and credit card (donation) details.Since January 2024, FortiGuard Labs researchers have also identified more than 1,000 newly registered domain names that incorporate election-related terms and references to prominent political figures. Fraudulent fundraising websites, including secureactsbluescom, meant to imitate the legitimate site for ActBlue (secureactbluecom), a nonprofit American fundraising platform and political action committee.The top two most-used hosting providers for these election-themed websites are AMAZON-02 and CLOUDFLARENET. The reliance on major hosting platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Cloudflare suggests that threat actors are leveraging these reputable services to enhance the legitimacy and resilience of their malicious domains.A notable concentration of domains is associated with a limited number of IP addresses, indicating a centralized approach by threat actors to efficiently manage multiple malicious domains to execute large-scale cyber campaigns.No Shortage of Personal Data Being Sold Aimed at the U.S.FortiGuard Labs analysis continues to show a significant number of diverse databases available on darknet forums targeting the U.S., including SSNs, usernames, email addresses, passwords, credit card data, date of birth, and other PII that could be used to challenge the integrity of the 2024 U.S. election. Specific highlights include:* Over 1.3 billion rows of combo lists, which include usernames, email addresses, and passwords, signify a considerable risk for credential-stuffing attacks. In such attacks, cybercriminals use these stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access to accounts, making it a valid and substantial security concern.* The discovery of 300,000 rows of credit card data, which include CVV, name, card number, expiration date, and date of birth, highlights potential financial fraud risks targeting voters and election officials.* Over 2 billion rows of user databases on the darknet indicate a heightened exposure to identity theft and targeted phishing attacks.* 10% of the posts on darknet forums are associated with SSN databases, which poses a significant threat by increasing the risk of personal data breaches.The U.S. Government Is an Increasingly Attractive TargetRansomware attacks targeting government agencies before an election can impact the electoral process and public trust in government institutions. Compared to 2023, the FortiGuard Labs research team observed a 28% spike in ransomware attacks against the U.S. government in 2024.The darknet has become a hub for U.S.-specific threats, where malicious actors trade sensitive information and can potentially develop strategies to exploit vulnerabilities. Approximately 3% of the posts on these forums involve databases related to business and government entities. These databases hold critical organizational data that is vulnerable to cyber exploits and are a prime target for threat actors as the elections come and go.Recommendations to Prevent and Mitigate Cyberattacks this Election SeasonCybersecurity measures are critical to safeguard the integrity of the U.S. 2024 presidential election. Following fundamental best practices can help prevent and mitigate the effects of cyber incidents. The full list of recommendations and best practices can be found in the report, but some key takeaways for citizens, business leaders, and election officials include:* Always remain vigilant for suspicious behavior or activity leading up to major events and prioritize good cyber hygiene.* Prioritize employee training and awareness.* Enforce multi-factor authentication and a strong-password policy.* Install endpoint protection solutions.* Patch operating systems and web servers and update software regularly.About the Fortinet FortiGuard Labs Election Security Report* This report provides an in-depth analysis of threats observed from January 2024 to August 2024. It examines the diverse array of cyberthreats that may affect U.S.-based entities and the electoral process.",

    "title": "Pelosi admits she hasn't spoken to Biden since forcing him to drop out",
    "content": "Nancy Pelosi has admitted she hasn't spoken to Joe Biden since she forced him to drop out of the 2024 presidential election. Pelosi was a key leader in getting Biden to drop out of the race in July, following his massive failure to combat Trump at a debate and amid fears he would not be able to lead the country given his age and state of mind.The former speaker of the House told the Guardian whether they had spoken since then, she said: ''Not since then, no. But I'm prayerful about it.' Pelosi said that while she considered the U.S. president a friend and politically-aligned ally, she knew that she had to do something to cut his time in the Oval Office short.'Elections are decisions. You decide to win. I decided a while ago that Donald Trump will never set foot in the White House again as president of the United States or in any other capacity. So when you make a decision, you have to make every decision in favor of winning... and the most important decision of all is the candidate.'She added: 'I have the greatest respect for him. I think he's one of the great consequential presidents of our country. I think his legacy had to be protected. I didn't see that happening in the course that it was on, the election was on.'Pelosi explained: 'My call was just to: Let's get on a better course. He will make the decision as to what that is. And he made that decision. But I think he has some unease because we've been friends for decades.'She said that she was keen to get Kamala Harris into the Oval Office in November. 'She's running on her strength, her knowledge of policy and strategy and presentation and the rest. And I think that's a different race than Hillary Clinton ran.'Pelosi added: 'I always thought America was more ready for a woman president than a woman speaker of the House. The Congress of the United States is not a glass ceiling there. It's a marble ceiling. And it was very hard to rise up there. But the public, I think, is better disposed. In Congress, they would say to me: 'Understand this, there's been a pecking order here for a long time of men who've been waiting for openings to happen and take their turn.' And I said: 'That's interesting. We've been waiting over 200 years.''The candidate are ramping up their campaigns, as November inches closer. One of Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris's top campaign advisors called publicly available polling 'horses***' just as her race with Donald Trump tightens. David Plouffe, a senior advisor to the Harris-Walz campaign and a former Barack Obama advisor, was adamant while speaking on the 'God Save America' podcast that the presidential race is closer than some surveys show.'I can't speak to the public polls. I spend very little time looking at them... most of them are horses***,' the strategist admitted. 'Some of them may be close but generally, I'd say any poll that shows Kamala Harris up four to five points in one of these seven states, ignore it,' he said referencing the critical battleground states. Any point that shows Donald Trump up like that - ignore it.'Want more stories like this from the Daily Mail? Hit the follow button above for more of the news you need.",

    "content": "The Founder of Glorious Word Power Ministry International, Rev. Isaac Owusu-Bempah, has reacted to a supposed threat by the Ashanti Regional Chairman of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), Bernard Antwi Boasiako, popularly known as Chairman Wontumi, not to step foot in Kumasi.Speaking to his congregation on October 13, 2024, Owusu-Bempah laughed at the suggestion that something might happen to him when he goes to Kumasi.He asserted that Wontumi was a nobody when he was roaming through the streets of Kumasi.\"I'm a Bantama boy, and so the day Chairman Wontumi said I can't step foot in Kumasi, he made me laugh. When I was going through the streets of Kumasi, Chairman Wontumi was a baby,\" he said in Twi.The pastor went on to refute a claim by the NPP Ashanti Regional chairman that he (Owusu-Bempah) has said in the past that Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia is going to win the 2024 presidential election.He said that he never anointed Dr. Bawumia, the presidential candidate of the NPP, as the next president of Ghana, as asserted by Wontumi.\"... I heard my little brother, Chairman Wontumi, say that he brought our vice president to my house and I made the vice president kneel, anointed him and said he (Dr. Bawumia) would be the next president. It is not true,\" he said.The pastor added, \"Even our vice president knows what Wontumi said is not the truth.\"What Wontumi said:Refuting allegations by Owusu-Bempah that the NPP was responsible for his arrest by the police in 2021 on Wontumi TV on Sunday, October 6, 2024, Chairman Wontumi stated that Rev. Owusu-Bempah contacted him after his arrest to explain the circumstances surrounding it, revealing that Agradaa had lodged a complaint against him.Chairman Wontumi therefore dismissed claims that some NPP leaders and elements were responsible for the man of God's arrest due to his refusal to support Dr. Bawumia's candidacy.\"I saw a video of him  claiming that the NPP was responsible for his arrest some time ago, not Agradaa, during an interview. He also stated that I urged him to leave Alan Kyerematen and support Bawumia's candidacy and that his refusal to do so is why some NPP leaders ordered his arrest.\"Mistakes can be forgiven because as humans we are bound to commit them, but when you lie or cheat, it cannot be forgiven. I don't even know Agradaa, and when the incident happened, I came on TV and radio to defend you. I received a call from Ernest Owusu-Bempah informing me of his arrest. I proceeded and spoke to him , and he narrated that he was arrested without knowing his offense or crime committed. It was when I started conducting my investigations into his arrest that he told me personally that Agradaa had lodged a case against him over an issue. So, I suggested to him to call Pastor Victor to intervene.\"...If today you are saying you are hurt and pained because NPP leaders ordered your arrest, then you are lying. As a man of God, you cannot peddle such lies,\" Chairman Wontumi said.Chairman Wontumi called Rev. Owusu-Bempah's bluff regarding his claims to reduce the NPP's chances of winning in the Ashanti Region, daring him to try.\"You claim our  votes will reduce drastically if you step foot in the Ashanti Region. I dare you to come. What can you do to reduce our votes in the region?\" he angrily said.BAI/AEWatch the latest episode of #SayItLoud on GhanaWeb TV below:Ghana's leading digital news platform, GhanaWeb, in conjunction with the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, is embarking on an aggressive campaign which is geared towards ensuring that parliament passes comprehensive legislation to guide organ harvesting, organ donation, and organ transplantation in the country.",

    "title": "Model Explains Why Debunking Election Myths Fails",
    "content": "When an election result is disputed, people who are skeptical about the outcome may be swayed by figures of authority who come down on one side or the other. Those figures can be independent monitors, political figures, or news organizations. However, these \"debunking\" efforts don't always have the desired effect, and in some cases, they can lead people to cling more tightly to their original position.Neuroscientists and political scientists at MIT and the University of California at Berkeley have now created a computational model that analyzes the factors that help to determine whether debunking efforts will persuade people to change their beliefs about the legitimacy of an election. Their findings suggest that while debunking fails much of the time, it can be successful under the right conditions.For instance, the model showed that successful debunking is more likely if people are less certain of their original beliefs and if they believe the authority is unbiased or strongly motivated by a desire for accuracy. It also helps when an authority comes out in support of a result that goes against a bias they are perceived to hold: for example, Fox News declaring that Joseph R. Biden had won in Arizona in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\"When people see an act of debunking, they treat it as a human action and understand it the way they understand human actions - that is, as something somebody did for their own reasons,\" says Rebecca Saxe, the John W. Jarve Professor of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, a member of MIT's McGovern Institute for Brain Research, and the senior author of the study. \"We've used a very simple, general model of how people understand other people's actions, and found that that's all you need to describe this complex phenomenon.\"The findings could have implications as the United States prepares for the presidential election taking place on Nov. 5, as they help to reveal the conditions that would be most likely to result in people accepting the election outcome.MIT graduate student Setayesh Radkani is the lead author of the paper, which appears today in a special election-themed issue of the journal PNAS Nexus . Marika Landau-Wells PhD '18, a former MIT postdoc who is now an assistant professor of political science at the University of California at Berkeley, is also an author of the study.Modeling motivationIn their work on election debunking, the MIT team took a novel approach, building on Saxe's extensive work studying \"theory of mind\" - how people think about the thoughts and motivations of other people.As part of her PhD thesis, Radkani has been developing a computational model of the cognitive processes that occur when people see others being punished by an authority. Not everyone interprets punitive actions the same way, depending on their previous beliefs about the action and the authority. Some may see the authority as acting legitimately to punish an act that was wrong, while others may see an authority overreaching to issue an unjust punishment.Last year, after participating in an MIT workshop on the topic of polarization in societies, Saxe and Radkani had the idea to apply the model to how people react to an authority attempting to sway their political beliefs. They enlisted Landau-Wells, who received her PhD in political science before working as a postdoc in Saxe's lab, to join their effort, and Landau suggested applying the model to debunking of beliefs regarding the legitimacy of an election result.The computational model created by Radkani is based on Bayesian inference, which allows the model to continually update its predictions of people's beliefs as they receive new information. This approach treats debunking as an action that a person undertakes for his or her own reasons. People who observe the authority's statement then make their own interpretation of why the person said what they did. Based on that interpretation, people may or may not change their own beliefs about the election result.Additionally, the model does not assume that any beliefs are necessarily incorrect or that any group of people is acting irrationally.\"The only assumption that we made is that there are two groups in the society that differ in their perspectives about a topic: One of them thinks that the election was stolen and the other group doesn't,\" Radkani says. \"Other than that, these groups are similar. They share their beliefs about the authority - what the different motives of the authority are and how motivated the authority is by each of those motives.\"The researchers modeled more than 200 different scenarios in which an authority attempts to debunk a belief held by one group regarding the validity of an election outcome.Each time they ran the model, the researchers altered the certainty levels of each group's original beliefs, and they also varied the groups' perceptions of the motivations of the authority. In some cases, groups believed the authority was motivated by promoting accuracy, and in others they did not. The researchers also altered the groups' perceptions of whether the authority was biased toward a particular viewpoint, and how strongly the groups believed in those perceptions.Building consensusIn each scenario, the researchers used the model to predict how each group would respond to a series of five statements made by an authority trying to convince them that the election had been legitimate. The researchers found that in most of the scenarios they looked at, beliefs remained polarized and in some cases became even further polarized. This polarization could also extend to new topics unrelated to the original context of the election, the researchers found.However, under some circumstances, the debunking was successful, and beliefs converged on an accepted outcome. This was more likely to happen when people were initially more uncertain about their original beliefs.\"When people are very, very certain, they become hard to move. So, in essence, a lot of this authority debunking doesn't matter,\" Landau-Wells says. \"However, there are a lot of people who are in this uncertain band. They have doubts, but they don't have firm beliefs. One of the lessons from this paper is that we're in a space where the model says you can affect people's beliefs and move them towards true things.\"Another factor that can lead to belief convergence is if people believe that the authority is unbiased and highly motivated by accuracy. Even more persuasive is when an authority makes a claim that goes against their perceived bias - for instance, Republican governors stating that elections in their states had been fair even though the Democratic candidate won.As the 2024 presidential election approaches, grassroots efforts have been made to train nonpartisan election observers who can vouch for whether an election was legitimate. These types of organizations may be well-positioned to help sway people who might have doubts about the election's legitimacy, the researchers say.\"They're trying to train to people to be independent, unbiased, and committed to the truth of the outcome more than anything else. Those are the types of entities that you want. We want them to succeed in being seen as independent. We want them to succeed as being seen as truthful, because in this space of uncertainty, those are the voices that can move people toward an accurate outcome,\" Landau-Wells says.The research was funded, in part, by the Patrick J.

    "title": "Kamala Set To Do Her First Formal Fox News Interview With Bret Baier [WATCH]",
    "content": "Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate in the 2024 presidential election, will sit down for her first formal interview on Fox News with the network's chief political anchor, Bret Baier.The interview will take place on Wednesday, October 16, in Pennsylvania, airing on Baier's \"Special Report\" at 6 p.m. ET.The interview marks a significant moment in Harris' media outreach as she has primarily appeared on more favorable platforms.Trump Fighting For America Collectable Gold Coin - Fight! - Must SeeBaier, who is anchoring his program from Pennsylvania that evening, will conduct the one-on-one conversation with Harris.The battleground state is crucial in the upcoming election, making it an ideal location for the high-profile interview.This appearance on Fox News is part of a broader media strategy for Harris, who has been increasing her visibility as the 2024 election approaches.Her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, has already made multiple appearances on the network.Just last Sunday, Walz appeared for the second consecutive week on \"Fox News Sunday.\"These interviews signal a concerted effort by the Democratic ticket to engage with a broader audience in the final stretch of the campaign.Harris' upcoming interview with Fox News follows a string of media appearances with other outlets.However, the vice president has faced criticism over her recent interview with CBS's \"60 Minutes.\"In that interview, Harris appeared to give two different answers to the same question about U.S. policy towards Israel. CBS aired both responses, which led to further scrutiny.Since then, Harris has participated in a series of more comfortable interviews, including appearances on ABC's \"The View,\" as well as shows hosted by Stephen Colbert and Howard Stern.Bret Baier co-led Fox News Channel's \"Democracy 2024\" coverage of both the Democratic and Republican National Conventions and has moderated multiple high-stakes political events.In addition to his role at Fox News, Baier has previously moderated town halls and debates with various political figures, including former President Donald Trump, who is Kamala Harris' main opponent in the 2024 election.The October 16 interview is expected to attract significant attention as Harris steps into a less familiar media landscape, offering the Democratic candidate an opportunity to reach voters who may not typically tune into her appearances on other networks.The interview comes at a critical time as Pennsylvania remains a pivotal battleground state.With both presidential campaigns focusing on key swing states, Harris' appearance on Fox News is part of a broader strategy to reach undecided voters and reinforce the importance of the state in the upcoming election.The opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of LifeZette.

    "title": "The Impending Betrayal of Ukraine | RUSI",
    "content": "Ukraine faces a precarious future amid waning Western support. The immediate peril comes from the 2024 US presidential election, but the fundamental problem has been the failure of Europe to commit to the defeat of Putin's invasion.The new NATO Secretary General, Mark Rutte, lost no time in visiting Kyiv after he assumed office, where he 'pledged continued support for Ukraine in its war with Russia'. Doubtless his words were sincerely intended, but he knows there are serious political headwinds across Europe and the US.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky senses this too as he briefs his 'Victory Plan' around European capitals following a mixed reception in Washington.The forthcoming presidential election in the US represents the point of maximum danger. A win by Donald Trump could see him placing a phone call to Russian President Vladimir Putin as early as 6 November. Any such call would set expectations of a negotiated settlement, with discussions possibly beginning in the early months of 2025.Nobody should want this war of 'meat grinder' savagery to continue a day longer than necessary. However, Zelensky would have much to fear from a deal negotiated by Trump. The 2020 Doha Accords with the Afghan Taliban have been described as the worst diplomatic agreement since Munich in 1938. Fortunately, Trump was prevented from reaching a similarly disastrous deal with Kim Jong-un of North Korea.In any such deal, Zelensky would be unlikely to secure the recovery of Crimea and the Donbas, reparations for the massive damage to his country, war crimes trials or membership of NATO. He might be able to bargain the Kursk salient in return for control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. But, without NATO membership and its Article 5 guarantee, there would be nothing to stop Putin from continuing the war after a couple of years of recovery and rearmament.Events since 7 October 2023 have done untold damage to Ukraine's prospects and to the West's much-vaunted rules-based international orderFor Europe, too, there would be peril. Both Georgia and Moldova look particularly fragile and vulnerable to Russian active measures or hybrid warfare. Even the Baltics would be justifiably nervous, in spite of their NATO status.However, it would be misleading to blame everything on Trump. There have been plenty of prior indications of trouble ahead.US support has always been too little, too late. Given the sheer scale of Washington's military support this might sound absurd, but President Joe Biden's hesitancy in allowing Storm Shadow missiles to be used against targets inside Russia is indicative of a general trend. As the head of a global superpower, Biden has always had one eye on ensuring that the war does not get out of hand and become nuclear. The result has been that Ukraine feels it has been given enough not to lose but not enough to win.In Europe the support has been varied. Some countries, such as the Baltics, the Scandinavian states, the UK and Poland, have done better than others. Hungary has been hostile, and may soon be joined by Slovakia and Austria. Germany has provided the most weapons but has been politically unreliable. Its refusal to supply Taurus missiles and its public debate about reducing its defence budget have sent all the wrong messages. German companies continue to retain significant interests in Russia, and the advance of Alternative for Germany in elections in Thuringia, Saxony and Brandenburg reminded Chancellor Olaf Scholz that there is little support for the war in Eastern Germany. President Emmanuel Macron of France, having been mercurial about Ukraine from the outset, received a similar jolt from the far left and far right in legislative elections in July.The most visible sign of a failure of collective determination to defeat Russia was the decision not to seize Russian financial assets frozen in Western banks, but instead to use them as collateral to raise a much smaller loan. Yes, there would have been a theoretical risk of undermining faith in the Western-dominated financial system, but few countries are yet ready to entrust their savings to Chinese or Indian banks. Furthermore, it would have sent a message to Putin not to invade other countries.Meanwhile, the crisis in the Middle East has diverted foreign policy and public attention. In Iraq and Afghanistan 20 years ago, the West demonstrated that it does not have the policy bandwidth to cope with two simultaneous campaigns. The events since 7 October 2023 have done untold damage to Ukraine's prospects and to the West's much-vaunted rules-based international order.A newly elected President Trump would rightly claim that, once again, the US has shouldered the main burden of Western interests with inadequate support from its NATO allies. He would point (correctly again) to the mounting military pressure on Ukraine, its difficulties in replacing front-line soldiers, and the effects on global food and fuel prices. With the war raging in the Levant, he would refer to the US being over-extended once again in 'forever wars'.A newly elected President Kamala Harris could be expected to follow the path trodden by Biden. She would inherit his caution at unduly provoking Putin and his reticence about Ukraine joining NATO. Furthermore, her freedom to supply Ukraine with additional weaponry could be restricted by the make-up of the two houses of Congress.This should have been Europe's war to manage. In spite of decades of discussion about European defence, it proved too convenient to rely on US largesseThere could be a third outcome to the election: a Harris victory that is contested by Trump. In such circumstances, we could see an absence of US foreign policy for a period of weeks or months.Barring a mutiny by Russian forces or a crisis in Moscow, the prospects for Ukraine (and therefore Europe) look grim. The irony is that Putin would claim victory in spite of his campaign having been a costly disaster.What would a betrayed Ukraine look like? At least it would retain some 82% of its territory. A guilty West would doubtless provide aid to rebuild infrastructure. It might be given a pathway to eventual EU membership (unless that option had been bargained away at the negotiating table), but joining the Western club may have lost its appeal at that point. Ukraine's corrupt oligarchs would re-emerge from hibernation. The old post-Soviet cynicism would replace the youthful enthusiasm of the Maidan generation. There would be antagonism towards those returning from abroad after avoiding the fight, and - of course - thousands of grieving families.This should have been Europe's war to manage. In spite of decades of discussion about European defence, it proved too convenient to rely on US largesse. This made Europe a prisoner of US electoral factors. It also caused Europe to shirk the difficult decisions that helping win the war entailed: the big increases in defence expenditure, the 24-hour working in ammunition factories, the hikes in food and energy costs and the political risks such as seizing frozen assets. What remains now for Europe is to secure a place at the negotiating table and to argue for NATO membership for Ukraine as part of any settlement.Failing that, the West will have years to repent the betrayal of the courageous Ukrainians, whose only crime was their wish to join the Western democratic order.The views expressed in this Commentary are the author's, and do not represent those of RUSI or any other institution.",

    "title": "Model reveals why debunking election misinformation often doesn't work",
    "content": "Caption: Scientists at MIT and the University of California at Berkeley have created a computational model that analyzes the factors that help to determine whether debunking efforts will persuade people to change their beliefs about the legitimacy of an election.When an election result is disputed, people who are skeptical about the outcome may be swayed by figures of authority who come down on one side or the other. Those figures can be independent monitors, political figures, or news organizations. However, these \"debunking\" efforts don't always have the desired effect, and in some cases, they can lead people to cling more tightly to their original position.Neuroscientists and political scientists at MIT and the University of California at Berkeley have now created a computational model that analyzes the factors that help to determine whether debunking efforts will persuade people to change their beliefs about the legitimacy of an election. Their findings suggest that while debunking fails much of the time, it can be successful under the right conditions.For instance, the model showed that successful debunking is more likely if people are less certain of their original beliefs and if they believe the authority is unbiased or strongly motivated by a desire for accuracy. It also helps when an authority comes out in support of a result that goes against a bias they are perceived to hold: for example, Fox News declaring that Joseph R. Biden had won in Arizona in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\"When people see an act of debunking, they treat it as a human action and understand it the way they understand human actions -- that is, as something somebody did for their own reasons,\" says Rebecca Saxe, the John W. Jarve Professor of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, a member of MIT's McGovern Institute for Brain Research, and the senior author of the study. \"We've used a very simple, general model of how people understand other people's actions, and found that that's all you need to describe this complex phenomenon.\"The findings could have implications as the United States prepares for the presidential election taking place on Nov. 5, as they help to reveal the conditions that would be most likely to result in people accepting the election outcome.MIT graduate student Setayesh Radkani is the lead author of the paper, which appears today in a special election-themed issue of the journal PNAS Nexus. Marika Landau-Wells PhD '18, a former MIT postdoc who is now an assistant professor of political science at the University of California at Berkeley, is also an author of the study.Modeling motivationIn their work on election debunking, the MIT team took a novel approach, building on Saxe's extensive work studying \"theory of mind\" -- how people think about the thoughts and motivations of other people.As part of her PhD thesis, Radkani has been developing a computational model of the cognitive processes that occur when people see others being punished by an authority. Not everyone interprets punitive actions the same way, depending on their previous beliefs about the action and the authority. Some may see the authority as acting legitimately to punish an act that was wrong, while others may see an authority overreaching to issue an unjust punishment.Last year, after participating in an MIT workshop on the topic of polarization in societies, Saxe and Radkani had the idea to apply the model to how people react to an authority attempting to sway their political beliefs. They enlisted Landau-Wells, who received her PhD in political science before working as a postdoc in Saxe's lab, to join their effort, and Landau suggested applying the model to debunking of beliefs regarding the legitimacy of an election result.The computational model created by Radkani is based on Bayesian inference, which allows the model to continually update its predictions of people's beliefs as they receive new information. This approach treats debunking as an action that a person undertakes for his or her own reasons. People who observe the authority's statement then make their own interpretation of why the person said what they did. Based on that interpretation, people may or may not change their own beliefs about the election result.Additionally, the model does not assume that any beliefs are necessarily incorrect or that any group of people is acting irrationally.\"The only assumption that we made is that there are two groups in the society that differ in their perspectives about a topic: One of them thinks that the election was stolen and the other group doesn't,\" Radkani says. \"Other than that, these groups are similar. They share their beliefs about the authority -- what the different motives of the authority are and how motivated the authority is by each of those motives.\"The researchers modeled more than 200 different scenarios in which an authority attempts to debunk a belief held by one group regarding the validity of an election outcome.Each time they ran the model, the researchers altered the certainty levels of each group's original beliefs, and they also varied the groups' perceptions of the motivations of the authority. In some cases, groups believed the authority was motivated by promoting accuracy, and in others they did not. The researchers also altered the groups' perceptions of whether the authority was biased toward a particular viewpoint, and how strongly the groups believed in those perceptions.Building consensusIn each scenario, the researchers used the model to predict how each group would respond to a series of five statements made by an authority trying to convince them that the election had been legitimate. The researchers found that in most of the scenarios they looked at, beliefs remained polarized and in some cases became even further polarized. This polarization could also extend to new topics unrelated to the original context of the election, the researchers found.However, under some circumstances, the debunking was successful, and beliefs converged on an accepted outcome. This was more likely to happen when people were initially more uncertain about their original beliefs.\"When people are very, very certain, they become hard to move. So, in essence, a lot of this authority debunking doesn't matter,\" Landau-Wells says. \"However, there are a lot of people who are in this uncertain band. They have doubts, but they don't have firm beliefs. One of the lessons from this paper is that we're in a space where the model says you can affect people's beliefs and move them towards true things.\"Another factor that can lead to belief convergence is if people believe that the authority is unbiased and highly motivated by accuracy. Even more persuasive is when an authority makes a claim that goes against their perceived bias -- for instance, Republican governors stating that elections in their states had been fair even though the Democratic candidate won.As the 2024 presidential election approaches, grassroots efforts have been made to train nonpartisan election observers who can vouch for whether an election was legitimate. These types of organizations may be well-positioned to help sway people who might have doubts about the election's legitimacy, the researchers say.\"They're trying to train to people to be independent, unbiased, and committed to the truth of the outcome more than anything else. Those are the types of entities that you want. We want them to succeed in being seen as independent. We want them to succeed as being seen as truthful, because in this space of uncertainty, those are the voices that can move people toward an accurate outcome,\" Landau-Wells says.The research was funded, in part, by the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation and the Guggenheim Foundation.",

    "title": "Trump again asks appeals court to move New York hush money case  to federal court",
    "content": "Former President Donald Trump has again asked an appeals court to transfer his New York criminal hush money case to federal court, reigniting an effort to stall his sentencing or throw out his conviction on 34 felony courts.In a filing on late Monday, Trump's lawyers asked the New York-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to reconsider a lower court's September decision denying the former president's attempt to remove the state case to federal court.Defense lawyers argued in the filing that the jury in the case improperly saw evidence of Trump's official acts as president which would have been protected by the Supreme Court's July ruling on presidential immunity.\"This case presents complex first-impression issues relating to the Supremacy Clause, federal-officer removal, appearances of impropriety and conflicts in connection with an unprecedented and baseless prosecution of the leading candidate in the 2024 Presidential election, and the ability of future Presidents to serve the American people without fear of reprisal from hostile local officials,\" lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove wrote in the 99-page filing.Trump was found guilty in May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in order to boost his electoral prospects in the 2016 presidential election.In July, the Supreme Court ruled in a blockbuster decision that Trump is entitled to immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts undertaken while in office.Criminal or civil cases against federal officials can be removed to federal court if the officials can prove the case centers on official conduct. When Trump sought to remove his hush money case to federal court in 2023 by arguing that the allegations related to his official acts as president, U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein denied the move, writing that \"hush money paid to an adult film star is not related to a President's official acts.\"Judge Hellerstein then denied Trump's request to reconsider his decision in September, as Trump was seeking to delay his sentencing, because the former president failed to show \"good cause\" for why the issue should be examined again.\"Nothing in the Supreme Court's opinion affects my previous conclusion that the hush money payments were private, unofficial acts, outside the bounds of executive authority,\" Judge Hellerstein wrote.Trump is now appealing Hellerstein's September decision, which defense lawyers argue relied on a \"profoundly flawed analysis.\"Trump is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 26, after the New York judge overseeing the case, Juan Merchan, granted Trump's request to delay sentencing until after the November election.In their filing Monday, Trump's lawyers also aired grievances about an alleged conflict of interest by Judge Merchan and political motivations of the prosecutors, writing that witnesses \"concocted the type of false and implausible story President Trump's political opponents wanted to hear.\"If the effort to remove the case to federal court is successful, it could give Trump the authority to kill the prosecution if he is elected to the presidency in November. Unlike his federal criminal cases, Trump is unable to direct the prosecution or pardon himself if the case remains in state court.The removal attempt could also impact the timing of Trump's Nov. 26 sentencing if the motion remains unresolved by then.Separately, Judge Merchan is expected to issue a ruling on Trump's effort to throw out the conviction based on presidential immunity by Nov. 12.",

    "content": "SUNNYVALE, Calif., Oct. 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --Derek Manky, Chief Security Strategist and VP of Global Threat Intelligence at Fortinet\"As the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches, it's critical to recognize and understand the cyberthreats that may impact the integrity and trustworthiness of the election process and the welfare of the participating citizens. Cyber adversaries, including state-sponsored actors and hacktivist groups, are increasingly active leading up to major events like elections. Remaining vigilant and identifying and analyzing potential cyberthreats and vulnerabilities is crucial for preparing and safeguarding against the lures and targeted cyberattacks that could take advantage of a heightened moment in time and even disrupt or influence electoral outcomes.\"News SummaryFortinet® FTNT, the global cybersecurity leader driving the convergence of networking and security, today released its FortiGuard Labs Threat Intelligence Report: Threat Actors Targeting the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, which reveals and analyzes threats tied to U.S.-based entities, voters, and the electoral process. Key findings from the threat intelligence report include:Phishing Scams Targeting Voters Leading Up to the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election: Threat actors are selling affordable phishing kits on the darknet designed to target voters and donors by impersonating the presidential candidates and their campaigns.Malicious Domain Registrations on the Rise: More than 1,000 new potentially malicious domains have also been registered since the beginning of 2024 that follow particular patterns and incorporate election-related content and candidates, suggesting that threat actors are leveraging the heightened interest surrounding the election to lure unsuspecting targets and potentially conduct malicious activities.Darknet Landscape: Billions of records from the U.S. are for sale on darknet forums, including Social Security numbers (SSNs), personally identifiable information (PII), and credentials that could be used in misinformation campaigns and lead to fraudulent activity, phishing scams, and account takeover; approximately 3% of the posts on darknet forums involve databases related to business and government entities.Ransomware Landscape: FortiGuard Labs researchers noted a 28% increase in ransomware attacks against the U.S. government year-over-year based on observed leak sites.Scams Targeting the U.S. 2024 Presidential Election Flood the DarknetCyber adversaries, including state-sponsored actors and hacktivist groups, are increasingly active in the lead-up to elections.The FortiGuard Labs research team observed threat actors selling distinct phishing kits for $1,260 each, created to impersonate U.S. presidential candidates. These kits are designed to harvest personal information, including names, addresses, and credit card (donation) details.Since January 2024, FortiGuard Labs researchers have also identified more than 1,000 newly registered domain names that incorporate election-related terms and references to prominent political figures. Fraudulent fundraising websites, including secureactsbluescom, meant to imitate the legitimate site for ActBlue (secureactbluecom), a nonprofit American fundraising platform and political action committee.The top two most-used hosting providers for these election-themed websites are AMAZON-02 and CLOUDFLARENET. The reliance on major hosting platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Cloudflare suggests that threat actors are leveraging these reputable services to enhance the legitimacy and resilience of their malicious domains.A notable concentration of domains is associated with a limited number of IP addresses, indicating a centralized approach by threat actors to efficiently manage multiple malicious domains to execute large-scale cyber campaigns.No Shortage of Personal Data Being Sold Aimed at the U.S.FortiGuard Labs analysis continues to show a significant number of diverse databases available on darknet forums targeting the U.S., including SSNs, usernames, email addresses, passwords, credit card data, date of birth, and other PII that could be used to challenge the integrity of the 2024 U.S. election. Specific highlights include:Over 1.3 billion rows of combo lists, which include usernames, email addresses, and passwords, signify a considerable risk for credential-stuffing attacks. In such attacks, cybercriminals use these stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access to accounts, making it a valid and substantial security concern.The discovery of 300,000 rows of credit card data, which include CVV, name, card number, expiration date, and date of birth, highlights potential financial fraud risks targeting voters and election officials.Over 2 billion rows of user databases on the darknet indicate a heightened exposure to identity theft and targeted phishing attacks.10% of the posts on darknet forums are associated with SSN databases, which poses a significant threat by increasing the risk of personal data breaches.The U.S. Government Is an Increasingly Attractive TargetRansomware attacks targeting government agencies before an election can impact the electoral process and public trust in government institutions. Compared to 2023, the FortiGuard Labs research team observed a 28% spike in ransomware attacks against the U.S. government in 2024.The darknet has become a hub for U.S.-specific threats, where malicious actors trade sensitive information and can potentially develop strategies to exploit vulnerabilities. Approximately 3% of the posts on these forums involve databases related to business and government entities. These databases hold critical organizational data that is vulnerable to cyber exploits and are a prime target for threat actors as the elections come and go.Recommendations to Prevent and Mitigate Cyberattacks this Election SeasonCybersecurity measures are critical to safeguard the integrity of the U.S. 2024 presidential election. Following fundamental best practices can help prevent and mitigate the effects of cyber incidents. The full list of recommendations and best practices can be found in the report, but some key takeaways for citizens, business leaders, and election officials include:Always remain vigilant for suspicious behavior or activity leading up to major events and prioritize good cyber hygiene.Prioritize employee training and awareness.Enforce multi-factor authentication and a strong-password policy.Install endpoint protection solutions.Patch operating systems and web servers and update software regularly.About the Fortinet FortiGuard Labs Election Security ReportThis report provides an in-depth analysis of threats observed from January 2024 to August 2024.

    "title": "Outrage In Italy As Illegal Immigrant Arrested For Raping And Impregnating 10-Year-Old",
    "content": "blueapples on XIn the months building up to the 2024 United States Presidential Election, the multitude of issues causing the rapid deterioration of the country have become somewhat distilled down to a singular crux: border security. Perhaps that is because Vice President Kamala Harris' role as the supposed 'Border Tsar' has allowed the rhetoric of her challengers to put the spotlight on her most profound failures or perhaps it's because a policy of open borders succinctly demonstrates the globalist agenda hellbent on eroding the sovereignty of the United States. In either case, immigration's ascent to the paramount focus of the election cycle demonstrates the existential threat it poses to the future of America as we know it.That existential threat is not unique to the United States though. Given that open borders have enabled the globalist agenda to infiltrate governments over the world, the maladies they infect nations with have reached pandemic proportions. The anguish of those ills has been illustrated once more in Italy, where a 28-year old asylum seeker has been accused of raping and impregnating a 10-year-old year in a migrant refuge center in the northern Italian region of Lombardy.The vile sexual assault is alleged to have taken place in San Colombano di Collio, Brescia at a refugee center located in a repurposed hotel. The policy of re-purposing hotels to serve as free housing for illegal immigrants is a policy that has become the hallmark of the Biden administration and liberal meccas who have labeled themselves as sanctuary cities in an effort to curry political favor with the globalist powers that be. The perils of the programs providing illegals with free housing at the taxpayer's expense have been chastised abroad for the same reasons that pillar of progressive immigration policy making has come under fire stateside.The same criticism has been echoed abroad as demonstrated by the outrage aimed at the Italian government in the wake of this latest high profile episode of endemic migrant crime. The center where the rape occurred presently houses 20 asylum seekers. The alleged rapist, a 28-year-old man from Bangladesh, was among the migrants housed at the center as were the victim and her mother, each from sub-Saharan Africa. The victim's mother alerted the officials running the center after she noticed a stark shift in her daughter's behavior and disposition. She was then taken to a local hospital where tests revealed that she was pregnant, prompting the 10-year-old to have an abortion soon thereafter.The alleged rapist was arrested and charged with aggravated sexual assault. He awaits trial in prison in Brescia, where he will continue to be a leach of taxpayers resources. Officials have transferred the victim and her mother to an isolated location where authorities say she can be better protected. The victim and her mother had been staying at the migrant refuge center previously while awaiting their request for international protection to be approved.Before the child was raped, the migrant center had already achieved ignominy in Italy. The facility took centerstage amidst protests against its conversion from a hotel going back to 2015. In the years since it's become a stepping stone for illegal immigrants to enter into the country, the vociferous opposition to it has largely been defeated through a war of attrition, the result of which left local resident demoralized until they ultimately accepted it becoming a cornerstone of their community.Despite the appalling attack, local community leaders still have come to the defense of the migrant center. The hotel's manager, Giovanni Cantoni, stated 'I get along very well with , better than with many Italians. And I have never, I repeat never, had any problems.' His sentiment was echoed by Don Battista Dassa, the priest of the local parish. 'If I hadn't read the newspaper, I wouldn't have known about this horrible event; in the four years that I've been here, I've never seen or heard anything problematic in the village because of migrants.\" the priest stated in an adamant defense of immigration policy that brought a child rapist into their community. Cantoni revealed that he was entirely unaware of the attack until the victim's mother reported it to him, highlighting his competency of management over the immigration center in San Colombano di Collio.Although the utter depravity of the rape has reignited outrage over illegal immigration in Italy, the incident is just another episode in an endless series of repugnance. In the last few years, the rise in rape cases across Italy has made the surge of crimes committed by illegals impossible to ignore. That culture shock is part of what led to Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni being elected to her office. Meloni campaigned on a promise to tackle illegal immigration head on, espousing much of the rhetoric echoed by Donald Trump during his 2024 presidential campaign. However, Meloni's promises have yet to be delivered as illegal entry into Italy rose by 47% in her first year in office. Although the Italian Prime Minister's platform has been met with the same kind of opposition to Trump's, her opposition's efforts to prevent her from delivering on her promise to stop the plague of illegal immigration into the country have finally started to falter.On Monday, Italy deported its first wave of illegal immigration into Albania. The mass deportation was enabled by an agreement between the two nations aimed at lessening the burden illegal immigrants have had on Italy. Notably, the agreement was forged between an EU member state in Italy and a non-EU nation in Albania. Policy experts from other countries are keen to assess the outcome of the agreement as it could serve as a template to advance similar initiatives elsewhere in the world.The logic behind the plan lies in the idea that immigrants deported to less desirable nations like Albania will be discouraged from seeking Italy as a primary destination. The agreement stipulates that migrants arriving in Italy will be taken by boat to the port town of Shengjin, where they will have their applications for asylum processed. After being processed, the illegal immigrants will be taken inland to the small town of Gjader where they will be isolated. However, under the terms of the agreement, no more than 3,000 illegal immigrants can be sent to Albania from Italy at a time.The rape of a 10-year-old girl by an illegal immigrant in Italy draws many parallels with the surge of migrant crime enabled by liberal policy making in the United States. In March, a 26-year-old Haitian migrant named Cory Alvarez was charged with raping a disabled 15-yea-old girl in a hotel that was also transformed into migrant housing in Rockland, Massachusetts. Alvarez was subsequently released on just $500 cash bond in July.Despite the utter lunacy of putting rapists back on the street, the practiced has become normalized, further emboldening criminals to illegally enter into the country given the lack of consequence. However, the tables have finally seemed to turn as immigration has remained the number one issue on voters' minds heading into the election. The cultural shift has put the Harris campaign and its Democratic allies on the defensive. Even stalwart Democratic figures like former president Bill Clinton have acknowledged that the lax immigration policy making led by Harris has enabled migrants to commit crimes like rape. When speaking to this point, Clinton admitted that the murder and attempted rape of Laken Riley could have been prevented if better vetting procedures were in place for illegal immigrants.Although Clinton's candid response may have been made out of relief that he was discussing a rape and murder that he wasn't implicated in for once, his Freudian slip was still an admission of the Democrat's failed immigration policies led by Harris. With the 2024 Presidential Election just weeks away, reconciling that failure may prove to be an impossible task. The futile effort of attempting to do so similarly reflects the irreconcilable failure that Kamala Harris' presidential candidacy has become.",

    "content": "San Francisco, Aug 20 (IANS) Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk on Tuesday said he is willing to serve the country after the US presidential candidate Donald Trump stated that he will consider the tech billionaire for a cabinet role or an advisory post if he wins the election in November.Musk posted \"I am willing to serve\" the country on X social media platform after Trump reportedly said he would welcome the billionaire to become part of the US administration once he is elected.The tech billionaire, albeit jokingly, even approved to lead the \"Department Of Government Efficiency (DOGE)\" in the new US government under Trump.\"That is the perfect name,\" he replied to a user who proposed the name of the ministry for Musk who has been supporting Trump on his social media platform.In an audio interview on X last week, Trump and Musk discussed a wide range of issues -- from immigration to the economy, education, climate change, Russia and Ukraine, the relationship with North Korea's Kim Jong Un, Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping in the context of the 2024 presidential election.Musk even tried to educate climate change sceptic Trump on greenhouse gas peril and renewable energy. Later, venture capitalist Vinod Khosla slammed Musk over his climate-talk tutorial, saying his thoughts about CO2 ppm (parts per million) levels and their consequences were simply \"dumb\".The X owner endorsed the former president against his Democrat rival, Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump said that illegal immigration saved his life while talking about the assassination attempt on him at an election rally. The interview broadcast was delayed by a cyber attack.The former president was permanently suspended from X in January 2021, when the social media platform was known as Twitter. The ban was lifted by Musk after he bought the platform.",

    "content": "Share this page on Facebook (opens in a new tab) Share this page on X (opens in a new tab) Share this page on LinkedIn (opens in a new tab) Share this page via Email Print this pageTeenage drug and alcohol use is on the decline and, for the first time in recent years, drug overdose deaths among teens have slightly decreased. Adolescent overdose fatalities first spiked with the onset of the pandemic, nearly doubling from 282 deaths in 2019 to 546 deaths in 2020. These deaths decreased from 721 in 2022 to 708 in 2023, a small reduction that marked a plateau and possibly the start of a decline in adolescent overdose deaths. While it is too early to determine what the direction of overdose deaths may be, factors that may have contributed to the small decline include a decrease in pandemic-related stressors along with policies aimed at reducing overdose deaths. Through the Biden-Harris Administration, naloxone was made available over the counter, access to substance use treatment and education was expanded, including in schools, and the Kids Online Health and Safety Task Force was launched, which aims to prevent teens from purchasing drugs via social media. With the 2024 Presidential election approaching and both candidates' plans to address the youth drug crisis differing widely, future policy efforts will depend on election outcomes.This issue brief analyzes CDC WONDER data - including provisional data from 2023 - and data from national surveys of adolescent youth to highlight trends in substance use and overdose deaths. It explores how and where teenagers receive substance use information and treatment and how school settings can be leveraged to enhance prevention measures. Lastly, it examines federal and state prevention efforts and social media's role in the drug crisis.Adolescent drug fatalities more than doubled in recent years - primarily due to opioids - but slightly decreased by the end of 2023. There were 708 adolescents drug fatalities in 2023, compared to 721 in 2022 (Figure 1). Additionally, a recent KFF analysis found that opioid-related deaths among adolescents decreased in the second half of 2023. Although these findings represent the first decrease in drug overdose fatalities in recent years, they remain more than twice as high as the number of adolescent overdose fatalities prior to the pandemic (708 deaths in 2023 vs. 282 deaths in 2019, Figure 1).Fentanyl overdose deaths increased by 2% from 2022 to 2023, marking the smallest annual increase in fentanyl deaths among adolescents since the pandemic began. The synthetic opioid, fentanyl, has largely driven the increase in adolescent drug fatalities since the pandemic began. In the first year of the pandemic, adolescent overdose deaths involving fentanyl increased by 177% (from 128 deaths in 2019 to 354 in 2020, Figure 1). While these deaths remain higher than pre-pandemic levels, the increase slowed to 2% from 2022 to 2023 (527 and 539 deaths, respectively).The share of all drug overdose deaths that involved fentanyl increased faster among adolescents than adults in recent years (Figure 2). Fentanyl deaths as a share of all adolescent drug overdose deaths increased significantly from 32% in 2018 to 65% in 2020. This increase marked the first time the share of drug fatalities involving fentanyl was higher among adolescents than adults (65% vs 62% in 2020). This gap has continued to slowly widen - in 2023, 76% and 69% of adolescent and adult drug fatalities involved fentanyl, respectively. While the share of fentanyl deaths increased more among adolescents than adults over time, the number and rates of these deaths remains much lower among adolescents compared to adults (539 vs. 72,000 deaths; and 2.1 vs. 27.6 deaths per 100,000 in 2023).Adolescents may obtain drugs through social media, and these drugs are often contaminated with fentanyl. In 2023, seven out of every ten counterfeit opioid pills were found by the Drug Enforcement Administration to contain a potentially deadly dose of the drug. Fentanyl is exceedingly lethal and is often used to lace drugs because it is cheap and highly potent. With the onset of the pandemic, fentanyl spread quickly into drug supplies and is often trafficked by U.S. citizens (although misinformation incorrectly links the spread of fentanyl to undocumented immigrants). Adolescent fentanyl overdoses are thought to be mostly accidental, as teens search for prescription opioids or other drugs, either for recreational or self-medication purposes, but instead encounter fentanyl-contaminated pills. Adolescents may acquire drugs through social media platforms, which are frequently scrutinized for lacking regulation around illegal drug sales. The National Crime Prevention Council estimates that eight in ten teen and young adult fentanyl overdose deaths are associated with social media contact.Despite the increase in drug overdose deaths among adolescents in recent years, their use of drugs and alcohol has slightly declined (Figure 3). In 2023, 10% of high school students reported ever using select illicit drugs, including cocaine, heroin, inhalants, methamphetamines, ecstasy, or hallucinogens, a slight decrease from 2017 (13%). Declines were also reported in opioid misuse (14% vs. 12%) and current alcohol use (30% vs. 22%) among high school students during the same period. Marijuana use has fluctuated, but ultimately decreased slightly since 2017 (20% vs. 17% in 2023). However, adolescent marijuana use may be linked to the onset of psychotic disorders, including depression and suicidality. Among high school students, the use of e-cigarettes declined from 14% in 2022 to 10% in 2023, although e-cigarettes remain the most often used tobacco product among this population in recent years. Factors that may have contributed to the overall decline in substance use among adolescents include public education initiatives and earlier intervention.As adolescent substance use and related deaths showed slight signs of improvement in 2023, so did adolescent mental health. The share of high school students reporting feelings of sadness and hopelessness - which can be indicative of depressive disorder - increased from 30% in 2013 to 42% in 2021, before slightly declining to 40% in 2023. The co-occurrence of poor mental health and substance use is common, with one in five youth who had a major depressive episode in the last year also having a substance use disorder. In a recent, CDC convenience sample survey of teens (ages 13 to 18) who used substances in the last 30 days, many teenagers reported using substances to cope with negative emotions. Although it is too early to know whether adolescent substance use and poor mental health will continue to decline, efforts to identify and harness the driving factors behind this change may help continue the downward trend.More than 6 in 10 adolescents report receiving information on drug and alcohol use disorder and prevention in school (Figure 4). This information is disseminated in multiple forms, including special substance use education classes, substance use-related films, lectures, and discussions outside of class, or substance use curricula integrated into health or physical education classes. A similar share of adolescents (63%) viewed messaging on substance use prevention outside of schools, while approximately half spoke with their parents on substance use harms (51%), and a small share participated in prevention programs outside of school settings (7%).In 2023, only 2 out of 10 adolescents with a substance use disorder received treatment in the past year. In 2023, 8.5% of adolescents (or 2.2 million) had a substance use disorder in the past year. Among these adolescents, 19.3% (or 423,000) received substance use disorder treatment in the past year.Adolescents face a number of barriers to substance use treatment, including limited access to residential treatment facilities and buprenorphine. Among the total adolescent population, treatment for any substance use issue was more commonly received in an outpatient setting (3.3%) (i.e. at a medical clinic, doctor's office, or therapist's office), followed by an inpatient setting (1.4%) (i.e. at a hospital or residential treatment center) in 2023. Many residential addiction treatment facilities do not accept adolescent patients, and among facilities that do, beds may not be immediately available. The number of treatment facilities by state varies greatly, as do costs. Additionally, few facilities provide buprenorphine, a medication that can reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings, to adolescents with opioid use disorder or discontinue it prior to discharge. Buprenorphine, a standard treatment for opioid use disorder is not approved for use by those under the age of 16, though it is recommended by the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. Still, some pediatricians feel uncomfortable prescribing it to adolescent patients.Recent federal efforts, including proposed bipartisan legislation, aim to strengthen youth substance use prevention programs in schools. The bipartisan Keeping Drugs Out of Schools Act was recently introduced, requesting federal authorization of 7 million dollars per year over 5 years for elementary, middle, and high schools to improve their drug prevention programs. The Biden-Harris administration also continues to respond to the youth drug crisis, most recently by allocating $94 million to community efforts to prevent youth overdoses via the Drug Free Communities Support Program, an initiative that often involves partnering with school districts to reduce youth substance use. Further, the Biden-Harris administration's Safer Communities Act facilitated expansions of behavioral health services in schools through Medicaid resources.Many states have policies allowing schools to stock naloxone (the opioid overdose reversal drug), an effort that is supported by the Biden-Harris administration, American Medical Association, and National Association of School Nurses. Most states have passed laws explicitly allowing schools to stock, naloxone, but only a few states, including Rhode Island and Washington, require it. Additionally, as of 2023, just over half of the nation's largest school districts reported they mandate stocking naloxone. Several school districts, including, most recently, Virginia's Loudon County School Board, have proposed or passed policies allowing students to carry and administer naloxone at school, after meeting certain requirements such as completing overdose-recognition training and obtaining written permission from their guardians. Some states, such as Washington and Oregon, have also passed legislation that integrates fentanyl education into school curricula. Among schools that do not stock naloxone, some worry that doing so will impact their image and label the school as having a drug problem, while others believe that there are more effective uses for limited school funds, as schools are fairly low frequency overdose locations.Outside of schools, federal and state lawmakers are attempting to address adolescent substance use through online safety legislation. At the federal level, accompanied by the Surgeon General's advisory on social media and youth mental health, the Biden-Harris Administration announced the Kids Online Health and Safety Task Force, which aims to enhance the health and safety of children on the internet. Similarly, the Kids Online Safety Act, a bill designed to increase regulation and accountability for social media companies, has been passed by the Senate, and President Biden stated he will sign it if it passes the House. Additionally, senators have introduced bipartisan legislation that aims to protect the privacy and wellbeing of children online. Multiple states have introduced legislation focused on media literacy, age verification, and the online distribution of controlled substances. Social media platforms are facing pressure from parents and lawmakers alike to increase regulation and to prevent online drug sales. These tech companies are protected by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which states that they are not liable for material posted on their platforms by third parties. In July of 2024, the Supreme Court turned away a case that would have warranted a thorough review of Section 230, thereby preserving the immunity of these social platforms. With mounting pressure, some social media companies are creating safety features to protect young users, including Meta's recently announced Teen Accounts feature.",

House Concurrent Resolution 203 would not recognize the election of a Democratic candidate for the presidency if the Republican candidates for president or vice president were \"assassinated, seriously injured during an assassination attempt, incarcerated, de facto eliminated or barred from the ballot in any states, or is the subject of legal actions that preclude their effective campaigning.\" The Resolution would also give the state attorney general and secretary of state the power to refuse to certify the state's electoral results if they \"determined\" there to have been \"election fraud or interference\" anywhere in the U.S.This action is just the latest of many through which West Virginia, while one of the smallest states in the U.S. in terms of both population and area, has played a significant role in American history, both reflecting and amplifying our defining debates and important issues.Subscribe and get unlimited access to our online magazine archive.Subscribe TodayThat role began with two crucial moments at the outset of the American Civil War. Even before West Virginia existed as a state, the region saw one of the most inciting actions in the nation's move toward civil war: abolitionist activist John Brown's raid on the federal arsenal at Harper's Ferry. From October 16-18, 1859, Brown and his party of 22 supporters captured and held the federal arsenal, hoping to arm enslaved people in the area and create a slave revolt across the southern states. While the arsenal was eventually retaken, both the raid and the subsequent trial and execution of Brown galvanized both anti- and pro-slavery forces, contributed directly to Abraham Lincoln's election as president in 1860, and has thus been defined by historians as an early action in the incipient Civil War.While Brown did not succeed in ending slavery in the area, the creation of West Virginia as a state was directly connected to the region's opposition to the broader slave system. While delegates to the Richmond (Virginia) convention of April 1861 voted for an Ordinance of Secession to join the emerging Confederate States of America, a significant majority of those delegates from the northwestern part of Virginia opposed secession and the Confederacy. In two consecutive conventions in Wheeling, first in May and then June 1861, representatives from this region voted to oppose secession and to separate from the rest of Virginia if need be. As the early events of the Civil War continued to play out, these representatives held a third convention in Wheeling, this one a Constitutional Convention; between November 1861 and February 1862 that meeting drafted a Constitution for a new state, West Virginia, that was formalized with the Constitution's ratification in May 1862 and admitted to the Union by President Lincoln in June 1863.Almost exactly half a century later, West Virginia was the site of another, very different rebellion. The nearly decade-long conflict that came to be known as the West Virginia Coal Wars (or Mine Wars) began with an extended labor action by mine workers, the Cabin Creek and Paint Creek strike of 1912-13. Organized by the labor leader Mary \"Mother Jones\" Jones and supported by the national United Mine Workers (UMW), the strikers advocated for better pay, safer conditions, and an end to discriminatory practices such as the requirement that they shop only at company-owned stores. When the mining companies refused to negotiate with the striking workers and instead hired armed agents of the Baldwin-Felts Detective Agency to put down the strike, the workers moved into union-supported \"coal camps\" and settled in for an extended labor action.The standoffs continued for years and culminated in one of the largest insurrections and most violent civil conflicts seen in America since the Civil War: the August 1921 \"Battle of Blair Mountain.\" Over a period of weeks, tens of thousands of striking miners fought a series of armed battles against thousands of lawmen and armed strikebreakers; the mining companies even hired private planes to drop bombs (many of them leftover from World War I) and poison gas on the strikers. When National Guard troops joined the forces opposing the strikers in early September, the conflict came to an end; nearly 1000 miners were indicted for murder and treason against the State of West Virginia, but most were acquitted. In the short term the conflict greatly weakened labor unions in the state, a trend seen across the 1920s in America; but in the long run the Coal Wars raised awareness and contributed to major victories for the United Mine Workers in and after the New Deal era of the 1930s.Later in the 20th century and into the 21st century, one groundbreaking and influential West Virginia politician came to represent the state's evolution on debates over civil rights. Robert C. Byrd (1917-2010) served three terms in the House of Representatives from 1953 to 1959 and then served as a Senator from West Virginia from 1959 until death in 2010, making him by far the longest-serving Senator in U.S. history (and the second-longest-serving member of Congress overall).Byrd began his political career in the early 1940s by organizing a new chapter of the Ku Klux Klan in the town of Sophia, West Virginia, and in 1944 wrote to the segregationist Mississippi Senator Theodore Bilbo \"I shall never fight in the armed forces with a negro by my side.\" When he first ran for political office shortly thereafter, a successful 1946 campaign for the West Virginia House of Delegates, it was with the encouragement of Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard Samuel Green.Yet by the end of his life, Byrd would call joining the Klan \"the greatest mistake I ever made,\" noting in a 2005 interview, \"I know now I was wrong. Intolerance had no place in America. I apologized a thousand times and don't mind apologizing over and over again. I can't erase what happened.\" His evolution on issues of race included both important individual actions, such as his efforts to integrate the U.S. Capitol Police for the first time since the Reconstruction period; and significant symbolic statements, such as his vocal support for the creation of the Martin Luther King Day federal holiday in 1983. As he told his staff at the time, \"I'm the only one in the Senate who must vote for this bill.\"In his final decades in the Senate, however, Byrd stood in the way of another emerging civil rights movement, becoming one of the federal government's most outspoken opponents of gay rights. In the debates over the Defense of Marriage Act, for example, he argued that \"the drive for same-sex marriage is, in effect, an effort to make a sneak attack on society by encoding this aberrant behavior in legal form before society itself has decided it should be legal.\" The West Virginia Senator became a key vote in support of that discriminatory federal law when it was passed in September 1996, one more way in which this small state has throughout its existence played a major role, for better and for worse, in reflecting and shaping American debates.Become a Saturday Evening Post member and enjoy unlimited access.

    "title": "Finnish capitalism at a tipping point: Resisting racism, austerity, and militarism | MR Online",
    "content": "Finland's 2023 parliamentary election saw the formation of a new government led by Peteri Orpo's National Coalition Party (NCP), with the True Finns as the main coalition partner. The NCP gained 20.8% of votes cast, the Finns came a close second (20.1% -- the strongest result since the party's founding), and the ruling Social Democrats led by Sanna Marin were knocked back into third place (19.9%). Two smaller parties -- the Swedish People's Party (RKP) and the Christian Democrats (KD) -- also joined the coalition, while the struggling agrarian Centre Party (having been part of the previous Marin government alongside the Greens, Left Alliance, and Swedish People's Party) went into opposition.Following the coalition negotiations, attention naturally centred on the issue of far-right racism. A far-right 'populist' party that achieved its electoral breakthrough in 2011 and spent two decades in opposition before joining Juha Sipilä's Centre-led cabinet in 2015 (and then returning to opposition following a 2017 split), the True Finns made their mark by ensuring that anti-immigrant policies were incorporated into the Orpo government programme. Such policies included higher income limits for foreign workers, tightened citizenship rules, and slashed quotas for refugees. Several Finns ministers made no secret of their overt hostility toward black and brown-skinned immigrants in particular, their far-right affiliations, and their pro-fascist or pro-Nazi sympathies.The Finns Party leader and current finance minister and deputy prime minister, Riikka Purra, has previously made a litany of racist and violent statements against immigrants (e.g., using the Finnish equivalent of the 'n-word') (Teivainen, 2023). Jussi Halla-aho, the former Finns leader, current speaker of the parliament, and 2024 presidential election candidate, is a militant racist with legal convictions for religious defamation who has called Islam a 'religion of paedophiles', claimed that thieving is a 'genetic trait' of Somalis, and stated his wish that pro-immigration female MPs be raped by foreigners (YLE, 2012). Soon after the election, Vilhelm Junnila, then minister of economic affairs, narrowly passed a vote of confidence but was forced to resign a few days later after it was revealed that he was a speaker at an event organized by violent fascists -- a veritable 'who's who' of neo-Nazis in Finland, including the now-banned Nordic Resistance Movement (Topping, 2023). Such racist scandals facing particular ministers have marred the government from virtually day one.In terms of building opposition to the most overtly racist dimensions of the Orpo-Purra programme, there have been numerous public protests and demonstrations. The largest was the 11,000-strong 'Me emme vaikene' (We are not silent) anti-racism protest held in Helsinki on 3 September 2023. Such mobilizations have played an important role in challenging what is rightly touted as one of the most right-wing administrations in Finland's history. But while early optimism was pervasive that the new government's small majority and tensions among its coalition partners would portend its downfall, these hopes quickly proved illusory.With the European Union economically and geopolitically squeezed between the United States and China plus the looming prospect of a second Trump presidency to the West and a victorious Putin to the East, Europe's far-right turn appears to be reaching an institutional tipping point (Varoufakis, 2024). In this unfolding epoch of capitalist catastrophe -- where the heightened political authoritarianism necessary to impose a renewed wave of economic austerity following the 2007-08 global financial crisis has tendentially eroded capitalism's representative political shell from within and paved the way for governing alliances between far-right racists and their neoliberal-centrist enablers, the left needs to decisively break with the terms of 'free markets' and 'liberal democracy' which have defined its accommodation to neoliberalism since the collapse of the Soviet Union.In the Finnish context, this break requires a clear rupture with liberal and centre-left opposition foregrounding the damage inflicted by the new government upon the country's 'progressive' international veneer. With their singular emphasis on combating the worst effects of anti-immigrant racism and the normalizing of far-right rhetoric, liberal anti-racism and anti-fascism factions entirely eschew the confrontation with underlying structural causes that is necessary for sustaining effective resistance. With this in mind, the current essay highlights two major drivers of the rise of the far-right that have the potential to underpin a revitalized counter-hegemonic politics of the left in Finland and elsewhere in Europe, namely those rooted in capitalist globalization's relentless march toward austerity and war.Unemployment and inflation are not caused by immigration. Immigrants and refugees do not have the power to alter market prices, under-pay, under-employ, or lay off workers. Such decisions are the prerogative of capitalist employers and the political parties that represent their collective interests by espousing the rhetoric of 'free markets'. Although multinational capital in particular claims to support the interests of foreign workers in the domestic labour market, this support is entirely secondary to its overarching commitment to advancing the forces of austerity, 'deregulation', and privatization. By undermining social solidarity and the welfare state, it is precisely these forces that have fuelled the underlying socio-economic discontent that enables anti-immigrant racism and xenophobic scapegoating to flourish.In the wake of the 1980s Reagan-Thatcher counter-revolution's crushing of organized labour and the neoliberal relaunch of European integration in the shadow of U.S.-led financial globalization, successive Finnish governments responded to the deep financial crisis of the 1990s by gradually dismantling the old postwar Nordic welfare state despite its enduring popularity. In its place, a neoliberal competition state was constructed under the aegis of the Ministry of Finance's central coordinating role in fashioning a national competitiveness strategy as the dominant mode of raison d'état (Kantola and Kananen, 2013; Ahlqvist and Moisio, 2014).These interests of dominant capital have received powerful expression in the Orpo government's economic strategy, where the NCP has led the way in championing a fiscal austerity programme that is radical by contemporary Finnish standards in the extent of its attacks on what remains of the labour movement and the welfare state. On the one hand, the Orpo government's programme entails a full-frontal assault on public provisions that mostly benefit the working class. In this regard, the government pushed forward €6 billion in cuts to public health, education, and welfare expenditure over the next four years -- including substantial reductions to and/or stricter means-testing for unemployment benefit, housing allowance, and social security.On the other hand, the programme is geared toward an all-out confrontation with the trade unions, encompassing direct attacks on workers' rights, attacks that threaten to undermine the effectiveness of the labour movement over the long term. These measures have ranged from a very unpopular policy to make the first day of sick leave unpaid to restrictions and fines for workers engaged in wildcat or sympathy strikes. They also encompass efforts to localize collective bargaining and afford employers greater leverage within the 'consensus-based' corporatist structures through which socio-economic policy in Finland is negotiated between big capital, labour, and the state (Ahponen, 2023).These attacks on workers' rights and the labour movement have not gone unnoticed by Finland's trade unions, which have sought to galvanize opposition to the government programme. The clearest expression of this tendency has been intermittent waves of political strike action (notably those from February-April 2024), which have showcased growing discontent with the government's neoliberal policies favouring austerity and labour market flexibilization while raising the prospect of a future general strike (YLE, 2024a). But while such actions underline the potential for building an alternative working-class politics rooted in collective struggle, solidarity, and organization amidst the severe 'cost of living' crisis confronting Finnish and European workers, the extent and results of this union mobilization have been far too constrained to threaten the survival of the government.Moreover, the left-leaning debate on opposing neoliberal austerity continues to sidestep the crucial question of the latter's structural causes rooted in capitalist globalization and particularly European integration as its concrete regional expression. This is especially the case in the wake of 'Brexit', where anti-globalization and anti-EU sentiment have become increasingly associated with the growing political salience of the 'Eurosceptic' far-right. But a strong argument can still be made that while the EU incorporates some commitments to minimal standards of employee protection, the free movement of workers, and international human rights law, its core institutions -- the single market and currency union -- amount to a thoroughly anti-democratic project of advancing 'free market' capitalism in the interests of big business. Since the mid-1980s, this project has overseen what is effectively a continent-wide structural adjustment programme, contributing to rising unemployment that has significantly weakened trade unions and facilitated the dismantling of national welfare states (Ryner and Cafruny, 2016; Carchedi, 2001; Patomäki, 2013).Although austerity is primarily implemented at the national level, the Finnish state's growing international obligations as an EU member state have played a major role in reinforcing the erosion of workers' rights and social protections. For example, European monetary and financial-market integration has since the 1990s played a key role in restructuring Finland's labour market by shaping the terms of the Finance Ministry's neoliberal competitiveness strategy premised on supply-side, 'beggar-thy-neighbour' policies. This is because the removal of national interest and exchange-rate policy mechanisms within the single market and eurozone result in an institutional loss of macroeconomic policy autonomy. This loss of policy autonomy, in turn, all but ensures that the burdens of macroeconomic adjustment fall squarely on wage restraint and flexibilization in the labour market. In short, all governments -- quite regardless of their political and ideological leanings -- are effectively bound to a policy of more-or-less competitive austerity, inducing tendencies toward a so-called 'race to the bottom'.Alongside this erosion of workers' rights and social protections, the EU's embrace of global and continent-wide free trade and capital mobility has resulted in a Europe that is grossly divided between a wealthy 'core' and a dependent 'periphery'. This latter point is well captured by the actions of the 'Troika' (the European Commission, European Central Bank, and International Monetary Fund) during the Greek sovereign debt crisis of the 2010s, which the Finnish government actively supported alongside the so-called 'Frugal Four' (Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Sweden) and other countries favouring EU budgetary restraint and tight fiscal policies in the eurozone (especially Germany and the UK). It is also illustrated by the unequal terms of EU enlargement in central and eastern Europe. Furthermore, instead of combating racism and Eurocentrism, the EU has promoted a 'Fortress Europe' that imposes grossly unequal terms of trade on underdeveloped countries in the global South and actively conspires against migrants seeking safe sanctuary from hunger, poverty, and war by crossing the Mediterranean.And by fuelling the rise of anti-immigrant racism, it is paradoxically EU support for free trade and capitalist globalization that has done the most damage to the progressive European ideal of international solidarity among peoples and nations. So long as this neoliberal policy programme implemented in various forms by successive Finnish governments is justified as necessary for advancing the European project, it will remain impossible to consistently oppose national and international pressures favouring competitive austerity.A revitalized working-class politics must therefore propose radical and concrete alternatives to the strongly neoliberal format taken by European integration since the 1980s. If European integration is to be salvaged, then there is no alternative but to oppose the EU's founding principle that labour mobility only matters as a complement to the mobility of capital. Ultimately, this means championing a politics of internationalism from below, one concerned with constitutionalizing workers' rights, the free movement of people, and the survival of the planet precisely by restricting the freedom of capitalists to move money and resources wherever they please, engage in free trade, and undermine trade unions through globalization.Alongside consistently opposing racism and austerity, defending the rights of migrants and refugees also means standing firm against the imperialist wars through which global capitalism and neo-colonialism kill and displace millions, particularly in the countries of the global South. This includes opposing the growing militarization of society, the use of weapons sales to buttress far-right, authoritarian and dictatorial regimes, and both direct and indirect armed interventions by hostile powers. Not only have militarization and war become major drivers of the global pool of displaced workers that has come to form the backbone of racist agitation in Finland and elsewhere, but they also exacerbate the conditions for far-right, neo-Nazi, and police violence against migrants, refugees, and their allies.But while it is the case that neoliberal austerity programmes have attracted growing, albeit inconsistent, criticism across Europe, consistent opposition to militarism and war has come under sustained and intense attack in the heated political climate following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Europe's political centre has converged around the American view that European leaders enabled the invasion by trading with Russia and appeasing Putin. Ukraine's need for self-defence has been exploited to shore up unconditional allegiance to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), lock in a renewed arms race, and deflect vital opposition to Russian imperialism away from support for peace, diplomacy, and human rights. There is a 'new McCarthyism' targeting peace activists, critics of Western foreign policy, and anyone voicing even mild doubts about a strategy of confrontation with Russia and/or China.In Finland, the issue of militarism has been further aggravated by the country's specific history of state formation, where tensions between Finnish national aspirations and Russian security interests have loomed large. After being elevated from a Swedish province (1150-1809) to an autonomous nation ('Grand Duchy') within the Russian Empire (1809-1917), Finnish national identity developed in opposition to its 'eastern' Other. As one former Finnish ambassador to the United Nations and Sweden puts it, \"Lutheran Finland with its western values and a legal system and administrative structure inherited from Sweden had no difficulty in marking its separateness from orthodox Russia, living under autocratic rule\" (Jakobson, 1987, p. 22).Amidst growing inter-imperial rivalry after 1870, a reciprocal process of enemy construction ensued as Finnish autonomy clashed with Russian imperial interests in maintaining autocracy at home and guarding against the threat of invasion posed by Germany's late industrialization. Despite Lenin's Bolsheviks being the first to recognize Finland's declaration of full independence in 1917 (following Tsarism's collapse in the throes of war and revolution), the Finnish Red Guards who took power in Helsinki in January 1918 were violently put down by General Carl Gustaf Mannerheim's White Army with the aid of a German expeditionary force. Russian fears that Finnish separatism could pave the way for a German invasion were confirmed, while Finnish nationalists came to regard \"Russia, Communist or otherwise, as the permanent enemy of Finland's freedom\" (Jakobson, 1987, p. 27).As each state's efforts to increase its security were perceived by the other as a security threat, both sides played a part in creating the enemy they claimed to be reacting to. It would take two Finnish-Soviet Wars (the Winter and Continuation wars) and several other tests before Stalin ultimately accepted Finnish independence and Finns learned to live with oscillating Soviet power. During the Cold War, Finland's militarily non-aligned foreign policy -- the Paasikivi-Kekkonen Doctrine of 'active neutrality' -- proved crucial to upholding this more harmonious geopolitical settlement. Even after the occupying Western powers revived post-fascist West Germany and integrated it into NATO in 1955 (leading the USSR to retaliate by announcing the Warsaw Pact the following week), Finland was able to successfully balance between East and West as the basis for retaining its independent statehood and building a universalist welfare state.In this context, the notion of 'Finlandisation' that became the West's conventional wisdom during the 1960s functioned primarily as an ideological stick for right-wing journalists and politicians. This was especially the case regarding German Christian Democratic (CDU/CSU) opposition to Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik, but Singleton (1981, p. 270) also cites a 1979 leading article in Britain's fearing,a Left-wing Labour government coming to power that would be prepared actually to cooperate with the Kremlin's plans for European 'Finlandisation'. Tony Wedgwood Benn in Downing Street, and Teddy Kennedy -- his equal in fatuity -- in the White House; from the Russian point of view that would represent a triumph of all the elements of Western intellectual and moral weaknesses.Within the terms of this critique of active neutrality as naïve subservience to Soviet aggrandisement in foreign policy as well as economics, politics, art, literature, and culture, Finnish President Urho Kekkonen was thus the archetypal 'Putin's Puppet' of his day -- representing the creeping Sovietization/Russification of the West. Such attitudes then provoked 'great resentment in Finland', where they were widely maligned as being 'based on ignorance of Finland's position vis-à-vis the Soviet Union' and as bearing 'no relationship to Finnish reality' (Singleton, 1981, p. 271).But with the collapse of Soviet 'state socialism' prefiguring the emergence of a greatly weakened and truncated capitalist Russia during the 'long 1990s' (1992-2007), the Finnish state's embrace of neoliberalism entailed an adaptation to American 'unipolar' hegemony via pivoting closer to the Western camp. Finland joined the EU in 1995 (along with Austria and Sweden) and cultivated a close partnership with NATO. As the foreign policy ideals associated with Nordic social democracy were gradually eclipsed by the geopolitics of 'free trade' and 'humanitarian intervention', this decades-long process culminated in the Marin government's decision to take Finland into NATO and the Orpo coalition's subsequent signing of a bilateral military pact with the U.S. in 2023 (Hakanen, 2023).This trajectory 'from neutral to NATO' raises serious questions about the small Finnish state's capacity to safeguard its security in a world of intensifying great-power competition. While Finland's drift toward NATO was permissible during the 'unipolar moment' of American hegemony in the 1990s and 2000s, the subsequent waning of this moment and Russia's growing independence from Washington in foreign policy make closer military alignment with the U.S. a potentially destabilizing step in the wrong direction. Amidst growing rivalry between Washington and Moscow, Helsinki's security looks very unlikely to be increased by the permanent military tension and the souring of diplomatic relations that will inevitably flow from being NATO's frontline country. Indeed, Finland's previous foreign policy of military non-alignment is ironically more -- rather than less -- relevant today than when the country began its drift toward NATO.Furthermore, there are already clear indications that 'NATO Finland' has shifted toward a decidedly more militaristic foreign policy, one according less weight to concerns over peacebuilding, human rights, and international law. This is particularly evident in relation to anti-colonial struggles, where the country has been complicit in the violent oppression of the Kurdish people by relaxing restrictions on arms exports to Turkey (a fellow NATO member state) (YLE, 2022). After finalizing a widely criticized €317 million arms deal with U.S.-ally Israel (for the 'David's Sling' air defence system), the Finnish government also abstained on a critical early UN vote over supporting a ceasefire to halt the genocide of Palestinians in Gaza, abstained in a subsequent vote supporting full Palestinian UN membership, and has since remained hostile to the growing Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement's calls to stem the rising tide of settler colonialism, anti-Palestinian racism, and scholasticide (Duong-Pedica, 2023; YLE, 2023; YLE, 2024b; YLE, 2024c).This foreign policy shift has proved especially unnerving given that Finland's NATO accession was rammed through the Eduskunta at breakneck speed amidst a significant curtailment of public debate. Rather than deliberating over the pros and cons of NATO and membership thereof, the focus remained squarely on Finland's old Russian enemy, which was represented in stark Manichean terms as an 'evil' adversary over which 'good' Ukraine and its Western allies could only triumph militarily (Lynch, 2023). In this context of visceral but decontextualized analogies between Finnish historical experience and the post-Euromaidan Ukrainian state's own failure to chart a viable strategic path between the twin perils of submitting to or suicidally resisting superior Russian power, a wide variety of arguments favouring negotiations to end the war or continuing with Finland's non-aligned foreign policy were summarily dismissed as 'pro-Putin', while protests opposing NATO accession tended to be marginal (numbering 500 people at best).Such curtailment of public debate amidst declining parliamentary accountability has only continued, for example, with the creation of the Helsinki Security Forum (HSF). Describing itself as a \"high-level, invitation-based event, bringing together over 200 decision-makers and international security and defence experts, and influencers,\" this secretive forum was first convened in 2022 by the Finnish Institute of International Affairs -- Finland's equivalent of the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations or British-based Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House).A world divided into rival military camps led by nuclear-armed great powers is no way forward for humanity. Such a world cannot provide the basis for lasting peace and security or address the existential emergency of climate change. Today, more than ever, a revitalized peace movement is needed to act as a political counterweight to pro-war hawks on both sides of Finland's eastern border. Such a movement could play a vital role in publicly advocating for an alternative vision of Finland as a neutral third force in world politics, one that is consistently committed to anti-colonial struggles, a revised post-Cold War security architecture (one more conducive to balancing the rights of small states with peaceful coexistence among the great powers), and greater European strategic autonomy vis-à-vis Washington. But in its absence, the far-right looks set to be the main beneficiary once the true costs and implications of NATO membership are revealed -- in a manner eerily reminiscent to how neoliberal free-market policies and institutions have spurred the growth of far-right Euroscepticism.By fusing a neoliberal economic programme with anti-immigrant social policy, the Orpo government represents an emerging political alliance between far-right racists and their neoliberal-centrist enablers. On the one hand, it embodies the waning of the 'post-political' neoliberal consensus epitomized by Clintonism in the U.S., Blairism in the UK, and 'Third Way' social democracy in Europe. Alongside supporting NATO expansion and the disastrous U.S.-led post-9/11 military interventions in the Global South carried out under the guise of the 'War on Terror', a large part of this neoliberal project during the 1990s and 2000s consisted of attempts to 'lock in' and 'constitutionalize' pro-market reforms by taking key issues about how the economy and society are governed out of politics.But since 2008, this neoliberal consensus has steadily lost much of its legitimacy in the context of a multidimensional crisis of global capitalism. In the decade from the global financial crisis to the global covid pandemic and beyond, various 'morbid symptoms' of this crisis have included massively growing economic inequality and social exclusion, a new wave of fiscal austerity eroding health, education, and social security, the rise of political leaders openly disdainful of globalization, growing recognition of the climate emergency, the return of 'stagflation' (rising unemployment and inflation), and the threat of nuclear war raised by the waning of American 'unipolar' hegemony.In this context of crisis, it has become harder and harder for political and corporate elites to mediate the tension between the requirements of global capital accumulation and the interests of the populations whose votes they need to stay in power. And although the 2010s saw the re-emergence of a fledgling socialist left, the main political beneficiary of this fracturing of neoliberal 'global governance' has been the far-right, with the dominant trend being a growing hyper-nationalist backlash that has increasingly upended the political system.Given this balance of political forces, what we are currently observing in country after country is a dialectical 'double act' between the waning neoliberal centre and the rising far right in all its possible combinations. This general tendency is the one that is currently playing out in Finland, albeit with its own national peculiarities and idiosyncrasies.If there is to be any hope of turning the tide, then it will be necessary to go beyond a one-sided focus on addressing the symptoms of far-right racism. This means beginning to unearth its deeper structural causes rooted in a global capitalist system whose endless prioritizing of profits from exploitation, war, and environmental destruction over human needs is driving working people -- and what remains of the 'middle class' -- into growing poverty, alienation, and destitution.",

    "content": "Administering an election is a balancing act that requires tabulating and releasing results as fast as possible, making it easy for as many voters as possible to participate, and keeping elections secure and voters confident in the process.Voters had plenty to argue about in the 1972 election, but they overwhelmingly agreed that when it came time to vote, they would do so in person on Election Day.The act of voting was largely a communal experience that year, when roughly 95% of voters went to their local polling places and completed and submitted their ballots in person on a single day, according to a census survey at the time.That number would fall gradually over the next 50 years as states provided Americans with more options on how and when to vote.Elections Elections Top 25: The people, places, races, dates and things to know By The Associated PressBy 2022, only about half of the electorate voted at the polls on Election Day. The share of people voting before Election Day spiked to more than 70% in 2020, and votes cast by mail surpassed those cast on Election Day for the first time ever. That year, many states enacted emergency measures to temporarily expand vote-by-mail options to protect voters from the spread of COVID-19.People are also reading...

Sometimes it refers explicitly to votes cast in person at local election offices or voting centers before Election Day.To avoid confusion, The Associated Press generally uses terms like \"advance voting\" or \"pre-Election Day voting\" to refer to that broader category and \"early in-person voting\" for the narrower one. \"Absentee voting\" usually refers to ballots cast by mail.What are the different types of advance voting?Voting before Election Day includes both voting by mail and in-person voting conducted before Election Day.Early in-person voting tends to mimic the experience of voting in person on Election Day, down to the type of voting equipment used and the locations serving as voting centers. The main difference is that the voting is conducted before Election Day. The length of early in-person voting periods varies by state.Mail voting can be further divided into at least two smaller categories: \"no-excuse absentee voting,\" where any voter may request a mail ballot for any reason, and \"excuse-required absentee voting,\" where only voters with a valid excuse as to why they cannot vote in person on Election Day may vote by mail.Requiring an excuse to vote absentee, such as travel or illness, used to be the norm in most states. Today, a shrinking handful of states still require voters to provide an authorized excuse.A third category of mail voting is a hybrid of mail voting and early in-person voting: in-person absentee voting, where a voter submits (and sometimes fills out) a mail ballot in person at an election office.A small but growing number of states conduct their elections predominantly by mail. Those states, plus a few others and the District of Columbia, automatically send every registered voter a ballot.When did advance voting begin?Variations of absentee voting and voting over multiple days have been part of American elections since the nation's founding. Today's system of mail voting and early in-person voting took root more than a century ago. In 1921, Louisiana paved the way for a formalized early in-person voting system when its constitution specified that \"the Legislature may provide a method by which absentee voting will be permitted other than by mail.\"Voting by mail is even older, but relatively few voters were allowed to take advantage of it as of 1972. Just two years later, Washington became the first state in the nation to allow any voter to request a mail ballot for any reason.By 2005, more than half the states adopted no-excuse absentee voting. Today, only Alabama, Mississippi and New Hampshire provide neither early in-person voting nor no-excuse absentee voting.Listen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our PodcastsDoes one political party use advance voting more than the other?Yes, but it wasn't always that way.Voting before Election Day grew more popular in both Democratic and Republican-controlled states after 1972. Although there was a partisan split in some states that sometimes varied from election to election, polling from Gallup shows that nationwide there was little partisan divide on advance voting between 2004 and 2016. But the survey showed that voters' plans to use early voting sharply diverged along party lines in the 2020 presidential election.AP's VoteCast survey of the 2020 electorate found a similar result, with additional details on how the choice of voting method divided the electorate. About two-thirds of the votes cast by mail in that election were for Democrat Joe Biden, compared with about one-third for Republican President Donald Trump. In contrast, Trump won about two-thirds of the in-person Election Day vote, compared with about one-third for Biden.When it came to early in-person voting, there was a near-even split, with Trump having only the slightest advantage.Government-politics Are males reluctant to vote for a woman? Harris' backers confronting question head on WILL WEISSERT and ZEKE MILLER Associated PressBiden overperformed among those casting votes before Election Day, especially among mail-in voters, even in many states that Trump won by a wide margin, VoteCast showed.\"This is just an across-the-board, national phenomenon,\" McDonald said.These patterns continued in the 2022 midterm elections, with Democrats accounting for the bulk of the mail vote, Republicans casting most of the Election Day vote and Republicans holding a small advantage in early in-person voting.McDonald noted that party behavior on pre-Election Day voting was, if anything, the opposite before 2020.\"People who voted by mail tended to be more Republican than the people who voted in-person early,\" he said, but those patterns \"were suddenly turned upside down\" during the pandemic.What led to the partisan split in advance voting?During the 2020 election, Trump repeatedly disparaged, politicized and undermined mail voting, going as far as to block funding to the U.S. Postal Service to thwart its ability to process mail ballots he claimed without evidence were susceptible to widespread tampering.Trump's messaging on mail balloting has been somewhat inconsistent. At times he has said \"absentee voting\" is \" good.\" But he also has claimed that mail voting is ripe for fraud, something not borne out by decades of mail voting conducted in every state. Trump himself has cast mail ballots on multiple occasions, including in the 2020 primaries.Trump's rhetoric seems to have taken a toll on Republican confidence in mail voting. An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in 2023 found that 58% of Republicans were not very or not at all confident that mail votes would be counted accurately, compared with 32% in 2018. Among Democrats, confidence in the counting of mail ballots increased, from 28% saying they were very or extremely confident in 2018 to 52% in 2023.What will advance voting look like in 2024?\"We need to wait and see how 2024 plays out before we make definitive statements about what the early voting is telling us\" about the election, McDonald said.Absentee voting in some states began as early as mid-September, and more than half the states began some type of voting by Oct. 1.Elections Doctor: Harris in 'excellent health.'

Presidential raceVice President Kamala Harris slammed Republican rival Donald Trump in Pennsylvania on Monday over the former president's comment that the US military should handle \"the enemy from within\" on Election Day. She portrayed Trump as dangerous and unstable following his remarks Sunday on Fox News, when he said he would call on US forces and the National Guard to suppress what he described as \"radical left lunatics.\" Trump, who incited violence to try to stay in power after the 2020 election, also said he isn't worried about his supporters' actions on November 5. Harris' campaign plans to seize on his remarks with a new ad that features Trump repeatedly invoking the phrase \"the enemy from within\" on the campaign trail.2. FEMAThe Federal Emergency Management Agency has resumed door-to-door neighborhood outreaches in some areas affected by Hurricane Helene after authorities arrested one man accused of making a threat against its employees. This comes after aid to several communities was paused in parts of North Carolina over the weekend due to reports of a truckload of militia, amid a backdrop of misinformation about responses to recent storms. Investigators later determined a 44-year-old man in possession of a handgun and rifle acted alone. FEMA has had to deal with a slew of threats and wild rumors about its latest relief efforts, which include an initial $750 payment to many victims. \"The contours of this misinformation are unlike anything we've seen before,\" a senior administration official told CNN last week.Video Ad FeedbackReported threats force FEMA to pause some aid operations in North Carolina02:54 - Source: CNN3. MedicareMedicare Advantage enrollees are encouraged to review their plans during open enrollment, which begins today and runs until December 7. Health experts say insurers are making a flurry of changes that could leave some senior citizens hunting for new policies, paying more out of pocket or getting skimpier supplemental benefits. For example, more than 16 million enrollees this year are in plans with no deductible for any drug. But in 2025, more than 45% of these members will be subject to a deductible for at least some drugs -- particularly brand-name or specialty medications -- if they stay in the same plan. Some insurers are also cutting back on allowances for dental, hearing and vision benefits.4. Israeli hostagesThe parents of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, an Israeli-American murdered by Hamas militants in Gaza in August, described the \"crushing blow\" of losing their son and say they fear that other families will receive the same \"devastating news\" unless world leaders take urgent action to secure the release of the remaining hostages. In the interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, both parents were wearing stickers with \"374\" written on them to mark the number of days that have passed since the hostages were taken to Gaza by Hamas. As part of its escalated offensive against the militant group in the enclave, the Israeli military has ordered civilians to leave and blocked all food from entering northern Gaza. The UN has warned that Israel is effectively sealing off the area and may be carrying out a \"large-scale forced transfer\" of civilians, which it said would amount to a war crime.Video Ad Feedback'We were in battle': Parents of murdered Israeli-American hostage speak to CNN01:37 - Source: CNN5. La NiñaA weak La Niña is expected to develop ahead of winter and affect temperatures, precipitation and snow across the US. La Niña is a natural climate pattern that influences global weather marked by cooler-than-average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. If this year's La Niña ends up rather weak, winter is expected to be warmer than normal across almost the entire southern half of the US and much of the East. This could mean some winter storms in parts of the East end up wetter, rather than snowier. It's a complete flip from winter 2023, which favored a wetter South and a drier North. Last winter's pattern was the warmest on record for the Lower 48 because it was dominated by La Niña's counterpart El Niño in a world also warming due to fossil fuel pollution.HAPPENING LATEREarly voting begins in Georgia todayTwo critical battleground states in the 2024 presidential election -- Georgia and North Carolina -- are kicking off early in-person voting this week.

    "content": "Nancy Pelosi has admitted she has not spoken to Joe Biden since she forced him to withdraw from the 2024 presidential election.Pelosi was a key leader in getting Biden to drop out of the race in July after his widespread failure to challenge Trump in a debate and amid fears that he could not help the country given his age and state of mind could lead.The former Speaker of the House of Representatives told the Guardian that although she considered the US president a friend and political ally, she knew she had to help him.'Elections are decisions. You decide to win. I decided some time ago that Donald Trump will never again set foot in the White House as President of the United States or in any other capacity.\"So when you make a decision, you have to make every decision in favor of winning... and the most important decision of all is the candidate.\"Nancy Pelosi (pictured) has admitted she has not spoken to Joe Biden since she forced him to withdraw from the 2024 presidential electionPelosi was a key leader in the unseating of Joe Biden (pictured) in JulyShe added: \"I have the utmost respect for him. I think he is one of the great consistent presidents of our country.\"I think his legacy needed to be protected. I didn't see that happening during the time the election was going on. My appeal was simply: \"Let's chart a better course.\"He will decide what that is. And he made that decision. But I think he's a little uncomfortable because we've been friends for decades.\"She said she would like to get Kamala Harris into the Oval Office in November.'She runs on her strength, her knowledge of policy and strategy and presentation and the rest.

The United States Congress is not a glass ceiling there. It's a marble ceiling. And it was very difficult to rise there.'But I think the public is in a better mood.

    "title": "The parties' coalitions are changing right before Election Day. Nobody knows what comes next.",
    "content": "The Democratic and Republican Parties' coalitions are undergoing a seismic change just weeks before Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump face off against each other.What comes after Election Day is anyone's guess.Harris is over-performing with seniors, sparking speculation she could even win a demographic that has traditionally leaned Republican. Trump, meanwhile, is eating into Democrats' edge with Black and Hispanic voters, particularly males, eroding a gap that has sunk past GOP presidential contenders.The 2024 presidential election therefore marks not just a key race to see who leads the country but also one of the first contests under what could be brand new dynamics for the parties. Gone, at least for now, are the days of Republicans banking on the support older voters -- some of the nation's most reliable ballot punchers -- and Democrats' proclamations that demography is destiny.\"The trend lines are that we can't take voters for granted, neither party can take voters for granted. The coalitions are shifting,\" said Jamal Simmons, a Democratic strategist and former communications director for Harris' vice-presidential office.Poll after poll suggests voter preferences are altering with little time to suss out what the changes mean.A CNN/SSRS poll released last month showed Harris leading Trump 50-46 among voters 65 years old and up. No Democratic presidential contender has carried that group since Al Gore in 2000.Meanwhile, a recent Pew poll showed Trump getting 14% support among Black voters and 38% support among Hispanic voters, compared to 79% and 54% for Harris, respectively. In 2020, President Joe Biden won 87% support from Black voters and 65% support from Latinos.Those numbers are even starker when divided by gender.Biden won 79% support from Black men and 59% support among Hispanic men four years ago. In the pew poll, those numbers dropped to 72% support for Harris from Black men and 53% support for her from Hispanic men.The shifting numbers have the campaigns and outside operatives scrambling to figure out why voter preferences are changing the way they are and how long after Nov. 5 that shift will continue.Strategists in both parties speculated that seniors defecting to Harris are motivated by temperament and healthcare, potentially spooked by the Jan. 6, 2021, riot on Capitol Hill and repeated Democratic attacks that Republicans will go after long-coveted entitlement programs.\"One is, is that Democrats have done a lot for seniors. Thirty-five-dollar insulin, $2,000 cap on prescription drugs, negotiating with Medicare, etc., etc. They have an advantage on voters trust them on Social Security and Medicare more than Republicans. And I think that there's a qualitative thing, which is, I don't think for seniors, Trump is their type of Republican. They don't like his behavior,\" said John Anzalone, a Democratic pollster who conducts surveys for both Harris' campaign and AARP.Black and Latino voters, meanwhile, are thought to be leaning more on economic arguments than racial ones that Democrats had long deployed. Those voters, experts said, defied traditional thinking of voters with uniquely strong cultural concerns and instead taking into account similar concerns as white working-class voters.\"What you're seeing is this transformation of things like race and ethnicity, where Black and brown voters are increasingly becoming more Republican for reasons that are clearly not racial,\" said Mike Madrid, a GOP strategist who studies and writes about Latino voting patterns. \"This peculiar interaction between race, economic class and diplomas or college education...are happening in very unique ways that are reshaping the coalitions.\"\"The Democratic Party is becoming more white, it's becoming less diverse, and where it's concentrating voters is with college-educated white progressives who are much more insulated to the economy and economic shocks and things like inflation and recessions. Those aren't issues for them. What is, is abortion rights, gun control, marriage equality,\" he said.Economic frustrations are thought to be particularly motivating among men, with whom Trump is consolidating support.\"Democrats have to talk about issues that are important to men, which are very often economic issues, particularly around aspirations. Men want to be able to take care of their families, be contributors to society, and have the standing that comes with a good job or a good business,\" Simmons said.Each candidate is putting in work to stem their losses.Trump has boasted of his plan to end taxes on Social Security income, and Harris is waging a full court media blitz to bring Black men back into the fold, appearing on key radio shows and deploying former President Barack Obama to deliver a stern message to those potentially wary of electing a female president.The country will only have to wait mere weeks to see if those efforts will pay off -- for this election. Even the most veteran operatives aren't sure what happens from Nov. 6 onward.Trump has said this will be his last race, and his singular hold on the GOP may not be replicated, meaning the day after he leaves the stage -- whenever that happens -- could mark a watershed political moment.\"I think you're asking the right questions. I just don't have all the right answers,\" GOP pollster Whit Ayres said when asked what comes next. \"I am loathe to try to give a prediction about what a party would look like without a figure that has so dominated the party for the last eight years.\"Some strategists think the dynamics will snap back -- with seniors going back to Republicans and voters of color coming home to the Democratic Party, arguing that the unique personalities in this year's race are driving the movement, as seen by more traditional trends playing out in some down-ballot races.\"If he goes away, if we beat him, I think that this whole thing starts lining back up long as you have a strong Democratic nominee,\" said Democratic strategist Chuck Rocha. \"I don't see all the opportunities once Donald Trump is gone, because the Donald Trump phenomenon is only happening with Donald Trump.\"\"I think Trump is seen as better on the economy among a subset of younger voters than most Republicans. So, I think it will be challenging for Republicans writ large to mimic that success,\" added a source familiar with the Harris campaign's thinking.Others disagreed, noting that the trends that are producing the changes, such as a rise in populism, were bubbling up prior to Trump and will outlive his political career.\"I don't think Trump is the driver of this,\" Madrid said. \"These dynamics began before him.\"I don't think it's as clear as to say one group is going to benefit over the other. I think what we're seeing is the movement of all these pieces away from a right-left spectrum to a top-down spectrum,\" he added.Still others predicted a whole new ballgame.Trump has undoubtedly altered America's politics, and, as seen by the failures of some of his primary rivals, his personal brand is difficult to replicate -- meaning without him on a ticket, the country might simply be staring into the political unknown.\"Floodgates open up for there to be competition among subgroups. I absolutely believe that. I think all bets are off. And it just depends on who the candidates are on both sides,\" Anzalone said. \"There may be no snapping back.\"",

    "content": "As many as 11 per cent women voters switched their support from Donald Trump to Kamala Harris after she took over the Democratic Party's reins in the 2024 US presidential election, according to a survey by KFF.After trailing for months, the Democrats found an upsurge in support as well as fundraising when President Joe Biden announced he would step down as the party's presumed nominee and endorsed Harris. Soon, the Democrats formally anointed Harris and she soon closed in the gap with Trump.The survey by KFF (formerly the Kaiser Family Foundation) tracked the views of women from June to September and found that, after Harris took over the baton from Biden, 11 per cent of women voters switched their allegiance from Trump to Harris.Of these women who switched their support from Trump to Harris, 25 per cent said they find Harris better than Trump and the rest mentioned her personal characteristics such as her age and experience as reasons for switching support, according to an analysis of the survey's findings by The New York Times.The survey further found that about two-thirds of women voters (64 per cent) are now satisfied with their options for president.Harris ramped up support on economy among womenHarris now leads by 7 per cent when it comes to women voters' trust in her ability to best address the rising household costs, according to the KFF survey.On this front, while Harris polled 46 per cent, Trump polled 39 per cent. For comparison, Biden and Trump were almost even in June.Inflation remains the top issue among women voters (36 per cent) and it ranks matters even more for sub-groups like Black women (51 per cent) and Hispanic women (41 per cent). Harris leads on the issue in these critical sub-groups.A slim majority of Hispanic women said Harris is more trusted on the economy, compared with 35 per cent supporting Trump, and Black women also trust her on economy by a much wider margin, according to The Times.Abortion now biggest issue among young womenAbortion is now the biggest issue for women aged under 30, according to the KFF survey.Four in 10 women voters (39 per cent) under 30 now say that abortion is the most important electoral issue for them, which is almost double compared to June (20 per cent), as per the survey.The Times' analysis sand that women have grown to trust Harris' stand on reproductive rights.Moreover, the centrality of the 2024 US presidential election to abortion and reproductive rights has also increased among women.Women voters are now 11 per cent more likely to say that this election will have a major impact on access to abortion and reproductive health care in the United States (65 per cent compared to 54 per cent, according to the KFF survey.",

    "title": "Memo to Kamala Harris: You gave the tools to beat Donald Trump: Use them",
    "content": "As the dangerous 2024 presidential election heads into the final, decisive weeks, convicted felon and constant liar Donald Trump is laying on more lies laced with doom and gloom and Vice President Kamala Harris needs to go more on the attack against the monster who has gained back some of the support from her replacement for aging Joe Biden and a spirited start that could be burning out.This turn of events worries many of us who think that she needs to pound Trump into the ground and get nasty and really mad.Leading the charge for more aggression by Harris is the Ragin' Cajun James Carville, the master strategist who helped steer Bill Clinton into the the presidency.\"Time is short, really short,\" Carville tells Maureen Dowd of The New York Times. \"She (and her team) need to be more aggressive. They don't strike me as having any kind of a killer instinct. They let one fat pitch after another go by. I'm scared to death. They have to hit hard -- pronto. Her campaign is still in Wilmington.\"Carville says Harris is trying too hard to be Joe Biden instead of Kamala Harris.Dowd seems to agree . She writes:Kamala spent a week answering questions on \"60 Minutes\" and \"The View\" and on the shows of Stephen Colbert and Howard Stern. And she didn't move the needle.\"She needs to stop answering questions and start asking questions,\" Carville said. He thinks that, for her closing message, she should put the issue of Jan. 6 and who won the election on the back burner.Instead, he said, she should ask: \"How dare JD Vance say with a straight face that Trump is the father of Obamacare when Trump tried to kill it 50 times?\"She should display pictures of right-wing judges who Trump could appoint to the Supreme Court, and ask if Americans are ready for an even more fanatical court.She should ask: \"Do you know how destructive tariffs can be? They will kill your freaking jobs.\"She should say she's going to end the Trump tax cuts for the rich and ask voters if they would rather use those trillion-plus dollars to help young people afford their first home.In other words, he said: \"She should scare the crap out of voters. You know, Trump is just taunting us, having a rally at Madison Square Garden just like the Nazis did in 1939.\"Black men and young Black men have to think about what they have at stake in the election. Donald Trump tells you that you have nothing to lose. Well, you have health insurance you could lose, you have a job you could lose.\"Other Democratic strategists I talked to agreed that Harris needs to let her guard down, cut loose and turn on the afterburners. Mainly, her pitch is that she's not Donald Trump. And that's an excellent pitch.But she needs to make the case for herself more assertively.It's hard to understand why she didn't sit down with a yellow pad or laptop long ago and decide why she wanted to be president, what her top priorities would be and how she would get that stuff done. The Vision Thing. Even when getting softballs from supportive TV hosts, Harris at times seemed unsure of how to answer.She didn't learn to tack to the center in bright blue California. When asked on \"The View\" whether she would have done anything different than Joe Biden, she said \"there is not a thing that comes to mind\" -- a flub if you want to convey change.Harris should distance herself from Biden when she needs to; she should just admit what we all know, that the border policy was bollixed up and that Biden was not tough enough with the execrable Bibi.Another Times columnist, Paul Krugman, says Trump is \"unmoored ih time\" and to be called down more for is non-stop lies:But don't tell Donald Trump. On Thursday, in the course of a rambling, at times incoherent speech to the Detroit Economic Club, he declared, \"We don't have electricity. In California, you have brownouts or blackouts every week. And blackouts, I mean, the place is stone cold broke, no electricity.\" This isn't true, it wasn't true when he made similar assertions last year, and 39 million Californians can tell you that it isn't true. But in Trump's mind, apparently, that long-ago electricity crisis never ended.:There's an obvious parallel with Trump's language on crime. In big cities, he has asserted, \"You can't walk across the street to get a loaf of bread. You get shot. You get mugged. You get raped. You get whatever it may be.\"Now, there was a time when America's big cities were quite dangerous. I remember the days when major parts of New York were more or less no-go zones. But that was long ago. There was a huge decline in the national murder rate between the early 1990s and the mid-2010s; a surge during Trump's last year in office seems to be fading away. New York's transformation into one of the safest places in America has been especially spectacular: The city had 83 percent fewer murders last year than it did in 1990, and neither I nor my neighbors seem terrified about crossing the street to buy bread at my local bodega.No doubt much of what Trump says about crime is a cynical attempt to stir up fear for political gain. That's certainly true of some of his other untrue assertions, like his false claims that the Biden administration is refusing to aid Republican regions devastated by hurricanes and has diverted disaster funding to migrants. I don't know whether Trump is aware that he's wrong to claim that all of the jobs created under President Biden have gone to \"illegal migrants,\" but I'm fairly sure that he doesn't care whether what he's saying is true.But it's hard to escape the sense that there's more than cynical calculation going on in some of Trump's whoppers, that he may actually believe some of what he's saying because he has become unmoored in time. On crime, for example, my guess is that in Trump's mind it's still 1989, the year he took out a full-page ad demanding that New York State bring back the death penalty after the rape of a woman who had been jogging in Central Park, for which five teenagers were wrongfully convicted.Electricity supply and urban crime aren't the only issues on which Trump's image of America seems stuck in the past. During his Detroit speech, the former president did something unusual for a candidate one might have expected to flatter the voters in an important swing state: He insulted the city that was hosting him, declaring that if Kamala Harris wins, \"Our whole country will end up being like Detroit.\"Actually, that would be great if true: Detroit has been experiencing a major economic revival, so much so that it has become a role model for struggling cities around the world and has been praised for its startup ecosystem. But I doubt that Trump knows or cares about any of that, and in his mind Detroit is probably still the poster child for the industrial Midwest's economic struggles around, say, 2010.The point is that there's a pattern here. As many observers have noted, Trump routinely peddles a grim picture of America that has little to do with reality. What I haven't seen noted as much is that his imaginary dystopia seems to be, in large part, a pastiche assembled from past episodes of dysfunction. These episodes apparently became lodged in his brain, and perhaps because he's someone who is not known for being interested in the details and who lives in a bubble of wealth and privilege, they never left.The thing is, Trump is fond of denigrating his opponents' cognitive capacity. He has called Harris \"mentally disabled\" and a \"dummy.\" He has called for CBS to lose its broadcasting rights over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with her -- one that was edited in a routine way -- in which Harris, a former prosecutor, came across as, well, pretty smart, whatever you may think of her policies.But what would Trump say about an opponent who, like him, seems stuck in the past, who routinely describes America in ways that suggest that he doesn't know what year it is?Harris should hammer Trump hard for his lies on crime. As a prosecutor, she put criminals like him in prison and thatis where he belongs and that is where he belongs. She needs to tell America how she can get rid of the abuses of Trump and his clan of MAGA Maggots.The house cleaning begins with defeating Trump in this year's election but the more will have to be done and Harris must convince that she is the one to do it. Most of us think she can but she must get direct and mean tell voters that she is mad as hell and is determined to make it better.",

    "title": "Donald Trump Asks Appeal Court For Second Chance",
    "content": "A judge \"ignored key evidence\" while refusing to transfer Donald Trump's hush money case to a federal court, his lawyers have complained.The former president's legal team are asking an appeal court to overrule the September 3 decision of federal judge Alvin Hellerstein, who refused to transfer the case.They want the case transferred to federal court so that Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, can claim presidential immunity. This is their second time asking the appeal court to intervene after Hellerstein's ruling.Trump faced trial in New York City on 34 counts of falsifying business records for $130,000 of hush money payments made to former adult film actor Stormy Daniels.Daniels was paid in the run up to the 2016 election to keep secret an alleged affair she had with Trump a decade earlier. Trump denies any sexual involvement with Daniels.Trump is due to be sentenced on November 26 before New York Superior Court judge, Juan Merchan.Hellerstein had rejected the argument that the Supreme Court's July 1 decision on presidential immunity should strike down the hush money case.Trump's lawyers have now taken a case to a New York federal appeal court, arguing that Hellerstein had ignored key facts.Their filing on Monday states that Hellerstein's September 3 ruling \"misapplied binding precedent and statutory removal procedure, ignored key evidence...and misapprehended the obligation of federal courts to provide an unbiased federal forum.\"Part of their argument for a venue change is Trump's desire to lift a gag order placed on during the hush money trial. It prohibits him from criticizing witnesses, jurors and court staff.Trump broke the gag order ten times during the trial and was fined $10,000 in total.In their latest filing, his lawyers state that there is a \"need to protect the integrity of the 2024 Presidential election by providing President Trump with a federal forum to seek prompt relief from an unconstitutional gag order that improperly restricts his campaign speech.\"They also argue that federal law should preempt state law when dealing with a federal officer such as the president and, once transferred to federal court, Trump should then be allowed to claim immunity.\"President Trump's removal notice more than adequately raises the 'colorable' defenses of preemption and federal immunity,\" they stated in a previous court filing.In his ruling, Hellerstein strongly rejected their claim that Trump's alleged hush money payments to Daniels were presidential acts and therefore came under the Supreme Court's decision on presidential immunity.\"Nothing in the Supreme Court's opinion affects my previous conclusion that the hush money payments were private, unofficial acts, outside the bounds of executive authority,\" he wrote.",

CBS aired both responses, which led to further scrutiny.Since then, Harris has participated in a series of more comfortable interviews, including appearances on ABC's \"The View,\" as well as shows hosted by Stephen Colbert and Howard Stern.Bret Baier co-led Fox News Channel's \"Democracy 2024\" coverage of both the Democratic and Republican National Conventions and has moderated multiple high-stakes political events.In addition to his role at Fox News, Baier has previously moderated town halls and debates with various political figures, including former President Donald Trump, who is Kamala Harris' main opponent in the 2024 election.The October 16 interview is expected to attract significant attention as Harris steps into a less familiar media landscape, offering the Democratic candidate an opportunity to reach voters who may not typically tune into her appearances on other networks.The interview comes at a critical time as Pennsylvania remains a pivotal battleground state.With both presidential campaigns focusing on key swing states, Harris' appearance on Fox News is part of a broader strategy to reach undecided voters and reinforce the importance of the state in the upcoming election.The opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of Objectivist.

    "content": "Administering an election is a balancing act that requires tabulating and releasing results as fast as possible, making it easy for as many voters as possible to participate, and keeping elections secure and voters confident in the process.Voters had plenty to argue about in the 1972 election, but they overwhelmingly agreed that when it came time to vote, they would do so in person on Election Day.The act of voting was largely a communal experience that year, when roughly 95% of voters went to their local polling places and completed and submitted their ballots in person on a single day, according to a census survey at the time.That number would fall gradually over the next 50 years as states provided Americans with more options on how and when to vote.Elections Top 25: The people, places, races, dates and things to know By The Associated PressBy 2022, only about half of the electorate voted at the polls on Election Day.

Yet it is highly politicized as voting in the 2024 presidential election is already underway.What is advance voting?Advance voting refers to the range of options that people have to vote before Election Day, whether by mail or in person at an election facility.The term \"early voting\" can refer collectively to all voting that takes place before Election Day. Sometimes it refers explicitly to votes cast in person at local election offices or voting centers before Election Day.To avoid confusion, The Associated Press generally uses terms like \"advance voting\" or \"pre-Election Day voting\" to refer to that broader category and \"early in-person voting\" for the narrower one. \"Absentee voting\" usually refers to ballots cast by mail.What are the different types of advance voting?Voting before Election Day includes both voting by mail and in-person voting conducted before Election Day.Early in-person voting tends to mimic the experience of voting in person on Election Day, down to the type of voting equipment used and the locations serving as voting centers. The main difference is that the voting is conducted before Election Day. The length of early in-person voting periods varies by state.Mail voting can be further divided into at least two smaller categories: \"no-excuse absentee voting,\" where any voter may request a mail ballot for any reason, and \"excuse-required absentee voting,\" where only voters with a valid excuse as to why they cannot vote in person on Election Day may vote by mail.Requiring an excuse to vote absentee, such as travel or illness, used to be the norm in most states. Today, a shrinking handful of states still require voters to provide an authorized excuse.A third category of mail voting is a hybrid of mail voting and early in-person voting: in-person absentee voting, where a voter submits (and sometimes fills out) a mail ballot in person at an election office.A small but growing number of states conduct their elections predominantly by mail. Those states, plus a few others and the District of Columbia, automatically send every registered voter a ballot.When did advance voting begin?Variations of absentee voting and voting over multiple days have been part of American elections since the nation's founding. Today's system of mail voting and early in-person voting took root more than a century ago. In 1921, Louisiana paved the way for a formalized early in-person voting system when its constitution specified that \"the Legislature may provide a method by which absentee voting will be permitted other than by mail.\"Voting by mail is even older, but relatively few voters were allowed to take advantage of it as of 1972. Just two years later, Washington became the first state in the nation to allow any voter to request a mail ballot for any reason.By 2005, more than half the states adopted no-excuse absentee voting. Today, only Alabama, Mississippi and New Hampshire provide neither early in-person voting nor no-excuse absentee voting.Does one political party use advance voting more than the other?Yes, but it wasn't always that way.Voting before Election Day grew more popular in both Democratic and Republican-controlled states after 1972. Although there was a partisan split in some states that sometimes varied from election to election, polling from Gallup shows that nationwide there was little partisan divide on advance voting between 2004 and 2016. But the survey showed that voters' plans to use early voting sharply diverged along party lines in the 2020 presidential election.AP's VoteCast survey of the 2020 electorate found a similar result, with additional details on how the choice of voting method divided the electorate. About two-thirds of the votes cast by mail in that election were for Democrat Joe Biden, compared with about one-third for Republican President Donald Trump. In contrast, Trump won about two-thirds of the in-person Election Day vote, compared with about one-third for Biden.When it came to early in-person voting, there was a near-even split, with Trump having only the slightest advantage.Government-politics Are males reluctant to vote for a woman? Harris' backers confronting question head on WILL WEISSERT and ZEKE MILLER Associated PressBiden overperformed among those casting votes before Election Day, especially among mail-in voters, even in many states that Trump won by a wide margin, VoteCast showed.\"This is just an across-the-board, national phenomenon,\" McDonald said.These patterns continued in the 2022 midterm elections, with Democrats accounting for the bulk of the mail vote, Republicans casting most of the Election Day vote and Republicans holding a small advantage in early in-person voting.McDonald noted that party behavior on pre-Election Day voting was, if anything, the opposite before 2020.\"People who voted by mail tended to be more Republican than the people who voted in-person early,\" he said, but those patterns \"were suddenly turned upside down\" during the pandemic.What led to the partisan split in advance voting?During the 2020 election, Trump repeatedly disparaged, politicized and undermined mail voting, going as far as to block funding to the U.S. Postal Service to thwart its ability to process mail ballots he claimed without evidence were susceptible to widespread tampering.Trump's messaging on mail balloting has been somewhat inconsistent. At times he has said \"absentee voting\" is \" good.\" But he also has claimed that mail voting is ripe for fraud, something not borne out by decades of mail voting conducted in every state. Trump himself has cast mail ballots on multiple occasions, including in the 2020 primaries.Trump's rhetoric seems to have taken a toll on Republican confidence in mail voting. An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in 2023 found that 58% of Republicans were not very or not at all confident that mail votes would be counted accurately, compared with 32% in 2018. Among Democrats, confidence in the counting of mail ballots increased, from 28% saying they were very or extremely confident in 2018 to 52% in 2023.What will advance voting look like in 2024?\"We need to wait and see how 2024 plays out before we make definitive statements about what the early voting is telling us\" about the election, McDonald said.Absentee voting in some states began as early as mid-September, and more than half the states began some type of voting by Oct. 1.Doctor: Harris in 'excellent health.'

    "title": "Donald Trump slams film 'The Apprentice' as director fires back",
    "content": "Former US President Donald Trump has taken to social media to voice his anger over the new film The Apprentice, which opened in theatres on 11 October.Directed by Ali Abbasi, the movie focuses on Trump's rise as a real estate tycoon in New York City. It also portrays his relationship with controversial lawyer Roy Cohn.Trump's reaction? He labelled it \"a politically disgusting hatchet job\" and didn't hold back in his criticism.But the director had a response of his own, showing he's ready to talk about the film, despite Trump's objections, according to Variety.Taking to Truth Social, Trump wrote a scathing post.He called the film \"a FAKE and CLASSLESS Movie\" and expressing disbelief that they could use the name The Apprentice.Trump seemed particularly concerned about the timing of the movie's release, just before the 2024 US Presidential Election.\"It's a cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job, put out right before the 2024 Presidential Election. It is trying to hurt the Greatest Political Movement in the History of our Country.Trump's first wife, Ivana, is played by Borat 2 actress Maria Bakalova. Despite Trump's tirade, Abbasi has not shied away from addressing the former president's comments.\"I'm available to talk further if you want,\" Abbasi responded on X (formerly Twitter).He added that his day was packed with press for The Apprentice, but he would try to make time for Trump the next day.It's a bold move, considering Trump's harsh criticism.Trump did not stop there. In his post, he also had a few choice words for the film's writer, Gabe Sherman. He called Gabe \"a lowlife and talentless hack\".Trump defended his relationship with his former wife, Ivana, calling her \"a kind and wonderful person\" and claimed that Sherman ignored the truth in the film's portrayal of her.The film has stirred up controversy since its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year, according to Forbes.Even before its release, Trump's campaign was already calling it \"garbage\" and \"pure fiction\".They threatened to file a lawsuit over what they called the film's \"blatantly false assertions.\"The campaign's chief spokesperson, Steven Cheung, went as far as to call it \"election interference\" by \"Hollywood elites.\" He further fanned the flames of Trump's claims of political bias in the film industry.Abbasi, on the other hand, seemed unbothered. At the Cannes press conference, he offered to meet Trump in person and even screen the film for him.\"I don't necessarily think this is a movie he would dislike,\" he said. \"I think he would be surprised, you know?\"As of now, The Apprentice continues its theatrical run, with viewers and critics weighing in on whether it's a fair portrayal or a politically charged piece of cinema.It remains to be seen whether Trump will take up Abbasi's offer.The film compares to local narratives by echoing familiar themes of political drama and media portrayal.It reminds us once again that the line between entertainment and politics often blurs across the world.Let us know by clicking on the comment tab below this article or by emailing info@thesouthafrican.com or sending a WhatsApp to 060 011 021 1.",

(YouTube/RuPaulsDragRace)Former RuPaul's Drag Race judge Santino Rice has been slammed by queens and winners of the franchise after endorsing Donald Trump for the US presidency.Best known for appearing as a contestant on Bravo's Project Runway in 2005 and then as one of RuPaul's regular right hand-judges on Drag Race from seasons 1 to 6 (with a guest spot on season 7), Santino Rice has largely slipped from the public consciousness since 2015.Every now and again, though, Rice pops up to make a statement or two - and his latest hasn't gone down well with fellow Drag Race alumni.\"I would love to see an intelligent and capable woman President some day, Kamala Harris is not her,\" Rice wrote on X (formerly Twitter).\"There's only one obvious candidate to rebuild America and stabilize the rest of the world and that is President Donald J. Trump.\"Multiple queens have slammed Rice's statement, including Drag Race UK winner The Vivienne.Fellow UK-based winner Lawrence Chaney also reacted to the post, telling Rice to, \"Sashay away\" in reference to Drag Race's iconic phrase.Rice's X profile contains several posts in support of Trump and slamming Harris, including one saying that calling Harris \"r*tarded\" is \"offensive to r*tards\". He also shared several AI-generated images of Kamala Harris holding a gun in her mouth.He is also opposed to vaccines, having previously claimed, \"there's no difference between injecting disinfectant and a random vaccine.\"Trump's campaign has included multiple attacks on the LGBTQ+ community, including the baseless claim that Democratic nominee Kamala Harris was \"conducting trangender operations on illegal aliens\" in prison.A far-right faction of the Republican party also has a proposed manifesto named Project 2025, which claims that one of the biggest problems facing the US today is the \"toxic normalisation of transgenderism with drag queens and pornography invading school libraries\".Project 2025, published by the hardline right-wing Heritage Foundation, pledges to strip away anti-discrimination policies, making it easier to target and discriminate against LGBTQ+ people.",

    "content": "Administering an election is a balancing act that requires tabulating and releasing results as fast as possible, making it easy for as many voters as possible to participate, and keeping elections secure and voters confident in the process.Voters had plenty to argue about in the 1972 election, but they overwhelmingly agreed that when it came time to vote, they would do so in person on Election Day.The act of voting was largely a communal experience that year, when roughly 95% of voters went to their local polling places and completed and submitted their ballots in person on a single day, according to a census survey at the time.That number would fall gradually over the next 50 years as states provided Americans with more options on how and when to vote.By 2022, only about half of the electorate voted at the polls on Election Day. The share of people voting before Election Day spiked to more than 70% in 2020, and votes cast by mail surpassed those cast on Election Day for the first time ever. That year, many states enacted emergency measures to temporarily expand vote-by-mail options to protect voters from the spread of COVID-19.\"We've been on an upward trend of early voting over time as more states have adopted early voting options and voters have embraced them,\" said University of Florida political science professor Michael McDonald, who tracks voter turnout and early voting. \"That's resulted in a greater share of early votes being cast each election cycle.\"For most of that time, advance voting was a nonpartisan feature of elections, but a deep chasm formed between the parties on advance voting during and since the 2020 presidential election.Voting before Election Day is much more common today than it was roughly 50 years ago. Yet it is highly politicized as voting in the 2024 presidential election is already underway.What is advance voting?Advance voting refers to the range of options that people have to vote before Election Day, whether by mail or in person at an election facility.The term \"early voting\" can refer collectively to all voting that takes place before Election Day. Sometimes it refers explicitly to votes cast in person at local election offices or voting centers before Election Day.To avoid confusion, The Associated Press generally uses terms like \"advance voting\" or \"pre-Election Day voting\" to refer to that broader category and \"early in-person voting\" for the narrower one. \"Absentee voting\" usually refers to ballots cast by mail.What are the different types of advance voting?Voting before Election Day includes both voting by mail and in-person voting conducted before Election Day.Early in-person voting tends to mimic the experience of voting in person on Election Day, down to the type of voting equipment used and the locations serving as voting centers. The main difference is that the voting is conducted before Election Day. The length of early in-person voting periods varies by state.Mail voting can be further divided into at least two smaller categories: \"no-excuse absentee voting,\" where any voter may request a mail ballot for any reason, and \"excuse-required absentee voting,\" where only voters with a valid excuse as to why they cannot vote in person on Election Day may vote by mail.Requiring an excuse to vote absentee, such as travel or illness, used to be the norm in most states. Today, a shrinking handful of states still require voters to provide an authorized excuse.A third category of mail voting is a hybrid of mail voting and early in-person voting: in-person absentee voting, where a voter submits (and sometimes fills out) a mail ballot in person at an election office.A small but growing number of states conduct their elections predominantly by mail. Those states, plus a few others and the District of Columbia, automatically send every registered voter a ballot.When did advance voting begin?Variations of absentee voting and voting over multiple days have been part of American elections since the nation's founding. Today's system of mail voting and early in-person voting took root more than a century ago. In 1921, Louisiana paved the way for a formalized early in-person voting system when its constitution specified that \"the Legislature may provide a method by which absentee voting will be permitted other than by mail.\"Voting by mail is even older, but relatively few voters were allowed to take advantage of it as of 1972. Just two years later, Washington became the first state in the nation to allow any voter to request a mail ballot for any reason.By 2005, more than half the states adopted no-excuse absentee voting. Today, only Alabama, Mississippi and New Hampshire provide neither early in-person voting nor no-excuse absentee voting.Listen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our PodcastsDoes one political party use advance voting more than the other?Yes, but it wasn't always that way.Voting before Election Day grew more popular in both Democratic and Republican-controlled states after 1972. Although there was a partisan split in some states that sometimes varied from election to election, polling from Gallup shows that nationwide there was little partisan divide on advance voting between 2004 and 2016. But the survey showed that voters' plans to use early voting sharply diverged along party lines in the 2020 presidential election.AP's VoteCast survey of the 2020 electorate found a similar result, with additional details on how the choice of voting method divided the electorate. About two-thirds of the votes cast by mail in that election were for Democrat Joe Biden, compared with about one-third for Republican President Donald Trump. In contrast, Trump won about two-thirds of the in-person Election Day vote, compared with about one-third for Biden.When it came to early in-person voting, there was a near-even split, with Trump having only the slightest advantage.Biden overperformed among those casting votes before Election Day, especially among mail-in voters, even in many states that Trump won by a wide margin, VoteCast showed.\"This is just an across-the-board, national phenomenon,\" McDonald said.These patterns continued in the 2022 midterm elections, with Democrats accounting for the bulk of the mail vote, Republicans casting most of the Election Day vote and Republicans holding a small advantage in early in-person voting.McDonald noted that party behavior on pre-Election Day voting was, if anything, the opposite before 2020.\"People who voted by mail tended to be more Republican than the people who voted in-person early,\" he said, but those patterns \"were suddenly turned upside down\" during the pandemic.What led to the partisan split in advance voting?During the 2020 election, Trump repeatedly disparaged, politicized and undermined mail voting, going as far as to block funding to the U.S. Postal Service to thwart its ability to process mail ballots he claimed without evidence were susceptible to widespread tampering.Trump's messaging on mail balloting has been somewhat inconsistent. At times he has said \"absentee voting\" is \" good.\" But he also has claimed that mail voting is ripe for fraud, something not borne out by decades of mail voting conducted in every state. Trump himself has cast mail ballots on multiple occasions, including in the 2020 primaries.Trump's rhetoric seems to have taken a toll on Republican confidence in mail voting. An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in 2023 found that 58% of Republicans were not very or not at all confident that mail votes would be counted accurately, compared with 32% in 2018. Among Democrats, confidence in the counting of mail ballots increased, from 28% saying they were very or extremely confident in 2018 to 52% in 2023.What will advance voting look like in 2024?\"We need to wait and see how 2024 plays out before we make definitive statements about what the early voting is telling us\" about the election, McDonald said.Absentee voting in some states began as early as mid-September, and more than half the states began some type of voting by Oct. 1.Get Government & Politics updates in your inbox!Stay up-to-date on the latest in local and national government and political topics with our newsletter.Sign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.",

Remember, those who don't meet tax due dates could face penalties and interest that will accrue until the situation is resolved.Vice President Kamala Harris slammed Republican rival Donald Trump in Pennsylvania on Monday over the former president's comment that the US military should handle \"the enemy from within\" on Election Day. She portrayed Trump as dangerous and unstable following his remarks Sunday on Fox News, when he said he would call on US forces and the National Guard to suppress what he described as \"radical left lunatics.\" Trump, who incited violence to try to stay in power after the 2020 election, also said he isn't worried about his supporters' actions on November 5. Harris' campaign plans to seize on his remarks with a new ad that features Trump repeatedly invoking the phrase \"the enemy from within\" on the campaign trail.The Federal Emergency Management Agency has resumed door-to-door neighborhood outreaches in some areas affected by Hurricane Helene after authorities arrested one man accused of making a threat against its employees. This comes after aid to several communities was paused in parts of North Carolina over the weekend due to reports of a truckload of militia, amid a backdrop of misinformation about responses to recent storms. Investigators later determined a 44-year-old man in possession of a handgun and rifle acted alone. FEMA has had to deal with a slew of threats and wild rumors about its latest relief efforts, which include an initial $750 payment to many victims. \"The contours of this misinformation are unlike anything we've seen before,\" a senior administration official told CNN last week.Medicare Advantage enrollees are encouraged to review their plans during open enrollment, which begins today and runs until December 7. Health experts say insurers are making a flurry of changes that could leave some senior citizens hunting for new policies, paying more out of pocket or getting skimpier supplemental benefits. For example, more than 16 million enrollees this year are in plans with no deductible for any drug. But in 2025, more than 45% of these members will be subject to a deductible for at least some drugs -- particularly brand-name or specialty medications -- if they stay in the same plan. Some insurers are also cutting back on allowances for dental, hearing and vision benefits.The parents of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, an Israeli-American murdered by Hamas militants in Gaza in August, described the \"crushing blow\" of losing their son and say they fear that other families will receive the same \"devastating news\" unless world leaders take urgent action to secure the release of the remaining hostages. In the interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, both parents were wearing stickers with \"374\" written on them to mark the number of days that have passed since the hostages were taken to Gaza by Hamas. As part of its escalated offensive against the militant group in the enclave, the Israeli military has ordered civilians to leave and blocked all food from entering northern Gaza. The UN has warned that Israel is effectively sealing off the area and may be carrying out a \"large-scale forced transfer\" of civilians, which it said would amount to a war crime.A weak La Niña is expected to develop ahead of winter and affect temperatures, precipitation and snow across the US. La Niña is a natural climate pattern that influences global weather marked by cooler-than-average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. If this year's La Niña ends up rather weak, winter is expected to be warmer than normal across almost the entire southern half of the US and much of the East. This could mean some winter storms in parts of the East end up wetter, rather than snowier. It's a complete flip from winter 2023, which favored a wetter South and a drier North. Last winter's pattern was the warmest on record for the Lower 48 because it was dominated by La Niña's counterpart El Niño in a world also warming due to fossil fuel pollution.Early voting begins in Georgia todayTwo critical battleground states in the 2024 presidential election -- Georgia and North Carolina -- are kicking off early in-person voting this week.

    "content": "Administering an election is a balancing act that requires tabulating and releasing results as fast as possible, making it easy for as many voters as possible to participate, and keeping elections secure and voters confident in the process.Voters had plenty to argue about in the 1972 election, but they overwhelmingly agreed that when it came time to vote, they would do so in person on Election Day.The act of voting was largely a communal experience that year, when roughly 95% of voters went to their local polling places and completed and submitted their ballots in person on a single day, according to a census survey at the time.That number would fall gradually over the next 50 years as states provided Americans with more options on how and when to vote.Elections Elections Top 25: The people, places, races, dates and things to know By The Associated PressBy 2022, only about half of the electorate voted at the polls on Election Day. The share of people voting before Election Day spiked to more than 70% in 2020, and votes cast by mail surpassed those cast on Election Day for the first time ever. That year, many states enacted emergency measures to temporarily expand vote-by-mail options to protect voters from the spread of COVID-19.People are also reading...

Yet it is highly politicized as voting in the 2024 presidential election is already underway.What is advance voting?Advance voting refers to the range of options that people have to vote before Election Day, whether by mail or in person at an election facility.The term \"early voting\" can refer collectively to all voting that takes place before Election Day. Sometimes it refers explicitly to votes cast in person at local election offices or voting centers before Election Day.To avoid confusion, The Associated Press generally uses terms like \"advance voting\" or \"pre-Election Day voting\" to refer to that broader category and \"early in-person voting\" for the narrower one. \"Absentee voting\" usually refers to ballots cast by mail.What are the different types of advance voting?Voting before Election Day includes both voting by mail and in-person voting conducted before Election Day.Early in-person voting tends to mimic the experience of voting in person on Election Day, down to the type of voting equipment used and the locations serving as voting centers. The main difference is that the voting is conducted before Election Day. The length of early in-person voting periods varies by state.Mail voting can be further divided into at least two smaller categories: \"no-excuse absentee voting,\" where any voter may request a mail ballot for any reason, and \"excuse-required absentee voting,\" where only voters with a valid excuse as to why they cannot vote in person on Election Day may vote by mail.Requiring an excuse to vote absentee, such as travel or illness, used to be the norm in most states. Today, a shrinking handful of states still require voters to provide an authorized excuse.A third category of mail voting is a hybrid of mail voting and early in-person voting: in-person absentee voting, where a voter submits (and sometimes fills out) a mail ballot in person at an election office.A small but growing number of states conduct their elections predominantly by mail. Those states, plus a few others and the District of Columbia, automatically send every registered voter a ballot.When did advance voting begin?Variations of absentee voting and voting over multiple days have been part of American elections since the nation's founding. Today's system of mail voting and early in-person voting took root more than a century ago. In 1921, Louisiana paved the way for a formalized early in-person voting system when its constitution specified that \"the Legislature may provide a method by which absentee voting will be permitted other than by mail.\"Voting by mail is even older, but relatively few voters were allowed to take advantage of it as of 1972. Just two years later, Washington became the first state in the nation to allow any voter to request a mail ballot for any reason.By 2005, more than half the states adopted no-excuse absentee voting. Today, only Alabama, Mississippi and New Hampshire provide neither early in-person voting nor no-excuse absentee voting.Listen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our PodcastsDoes one political party use advance voting more than the other?Yes, but it wasn't always that way.Voting before Election Day grew more popular in both Democratic and Republican-controlled states after 1972. Although there was a partisan split in some states that sometimes varied from election to election, polling from Gallup shows that nationwide there was little partisan divide on advance voting between 2004 and 2016. But the survey showed that voters' plans to use early voting sharply diverged along party lines in the 2020 presidential election.AP's VoteCast survey of the 2020 electorate found a similar result, with additional details on how the choice of voting method divided the electorate. About two-thirds of the votes cast by mail in that election were for Democrat Joe Biden, compared with about one-third for Republican President Donald Trump. In contrast, Trump won about two-thirds of the in-person Election Day vote, compared with about one-third for Biden.When it came to early in-person voting, there was a near-even split, with Trump having only the slightest advantage.Elections Are males reluctant to vote for a woman? Harris' backers confronting question head on WILL WEISSERT and ZEKE MILLER Associated PressBiden overperformed among those casting votes before Election Day, especially among mail-in voters, even in many states that Trump won by a wide margin, VoteCast showed.\"This is just an across-the-board, national phenomenon,\" McDonald said.These patterns continued in the 2022 midterm elections, with Democrats accounting for the bulk of the mail vote, Republicans casting most of the Election Day vote and Republicans holding a small advantage in early in-person voting.McDonald noted that party behavior on pre-Election Day voting was, if anything, the opposite before 2020.\"People who voted by mail tended to be more Republican than the people who voted in-person early,\" he said, but those patterns \"were suddenly turned upside down\" during the pandemic.What led to the partisan split in advance voting?During the 2020 election, Trump repeatedly disparaged, politicized and undermined mail voting, going as far as to block funding to the U.S. Postal Service to thwart its ability to process mail ballots he claimed without evidence were susceptible to widespread tampering.Trump's messaging on mail balloting has been somewhat inconsistent. At times he has said \"absentee voting\" is \" good.\" But he also has claimed that mail voting is ripe for fraud, something not borne out by decades of mail voting conducted in every state. Trump himself has cast mail ballots on multiple occasions, including in the 2020 primaries.Trump's rhetoric seems to have taken a toll on Republican confidence in mail voting. An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in 2023 found that 58% of Republicans were not very or not at all confident that mail votes would be counted accurately, compared with 32% in 2018. Among Democrats, confidence in the counting of mail ballots increased, from 28% saying they were very or extremely confident in 2018 to 52% in 2023.What will advance voting look like in 2024?\"We need to wait and see how 2024 plays out before we make definitive statements about what the early voting is telling us\" about the election, McDonald said.Absentee voting in some states began as early as mid-September, and more than half the states began some type of voting by Oct. 1.Elections Doctor: Harris in 'excellent health.'

The length of early in-person voting periods varies by state.Mail voting can be further divided into at least two smaller categories: \"no-excuse absentee voting,\" where any voter may request a mail ballot for any reason, and \"excuse-required absentee voting,\" where only voters with a valid excuse as to why they cannot vote in person on Election Day may vote by mail.Requiring an excuse to vote absentee, such as travel or illness, used to be the norm in most states. Today, a shrinking handful of states still require voters to provide an authorized excuse.A third category of mail voting is a hybrid of mail voting and early in-person voting: in-person absentee voting, where a voter submits (and sometimes fills out) a mail ballot in person at an election office.A small but growing number of states conduct their elections predominantly by mail. Those states, plus a few others and the District of Columbia, automatically send every registered voter a ballot.When did advance voting begin?Variations of absentee voting and voting over multiple days have been part of American elections since the nation's founding. Today's system of mail voting and early in-person voting took root more than a century ago. In 1921, Louisiana paved the way for a formalized early in-person voting system when its constitution specified that \"the Legislature may provide a method by which absentee voting will be permitted other than by mail.\"Voting by mail is even older, but relatively few voters were allowed to take advantage of it as of 1972. Just two years later, Washington became the first state in the nation to allow any voter to request a mail ballot for any reason.By 2005, more than half the states adopted no-excuse absentee voting. Today, only Alabama, Mississippi and New Hampshire provide neither early in-person voting nor no-excuse absentee voting.Does one political party use advance voting more than the other?Yes, but it wasn't always that way.Voting before Election Day grew more popular in both Democratic and Republican-controlled states after 1972. Although there was a partisan split in some states that sometimes varied from election to election, polling from Gallup shows that nationwide there was little partisan divide on advance voting between 2004 and 2016. But the survey showed that voters' plans to use early voting sharply diverged along party lines in the 2020 presidential election.AP's VoteCast survey of the 2020 electorate found a similar result, with additional details on how the choice of voting method divided the electorate. About two-thirds of the votes cast by mail in that election were for Democrat Joe Biden, compared with about one-third for Republican President Donald Trump. In contrast, Trump won about two-thirds of the in-person Election Day vote, compared with about one-third for Biden.When it came to early in-person voting, there was a near-even split, with Trump having only the slightest advantage.Government-politics Are males reluctant to vote for a woman?

At times he has said \"absentee voting\" is \" good.\" But he also has claimed that mail voting is ripe for fraud, something not borne out by decades of mail voting conducted in every state. Trump himself has cast mail ballots on multiple occasions, including in the 2020 primaries.Trump's rhetoric seems to have taken a toll on Republican confidence in mail voting. An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in 2023 found that 58% of Republicans were not very or not at all confident that mail votes would be counted accurately, compared with 32% in 2018. Among Democrats, confidence in the counting of mail ballots increased, from 28% saying they were very or extremely confident in 2018 to 52% in 2023.What will advance voting look like in 2024?\"We need to wait and see how 2024 plays out before we make definitive statements about what the early voting is telling us\" about the election, McDonald said.Absentee voting in some states began as early as mid-September, and more than half the states began some type of voting by Oct. 1.Elections Doctor: Harris in 'excellent health.'

    "content": "(CNN) -- Most taxpayers filed their 2023 returns by the official deadline in mid-April, or they applied for an extension, giving them until today to file their returns. Remember, those who don't meet tax due dates could face penalties and interest that will accrue until the situation is resolved.Vice President Kamala Harris slammed Republican rival Donald Trump in Pennsylvania on Monday over the former president's comment that the US military should handle \"the enemy from within\" on Election Day. She portrayed Trump as dangerous and unstable following his remarks Sunday on Fox News, when he said he would call on US forces and the National Guard to suppress what he described as \"radical left lunatics.\" Trump, who incited violence to try to stay in power after the 2020 election, also said he isn't worried about his supporters' actions on November 5. Harris' campaign plans to seize on his remarks with a new ad that features Trump repeatedly invoking the phrase \"the enemy from within\" on the campaign trail.The Federal Emergency Management Agency has resumed door-to-door neighborhood outreaches in some areas affected by Hurricane Helene after authorities arrested one man accused of making a threat against its employees. This comes after aid to several communities was paused in parts of North Carolina over the weekend due to reports of a truckload of militia, amid a backdrop of misinformation about responses to recent storms. Investigators later determined a 44-year-old man in possession of a handgun and rifle acted alone. FEMA has had to deal with a slew of threats and wild rumors about its latest relief efforts, which include an initial $750 payment to many victims. \"The contours of this misinformation are unlike anything we've seen before,\" a senior administration official told CNN last week.Medicare Advantage enrollees are encouraged to review their plans during open enrollment, which begins today and runs until December 7. Health experts say insurers are making a flurry of changes that could leave some senior citizens hunting for new policies, paying more out of pocket or getting skimpier supplemental benefits. For example, more than 16 million enrollees this year are in plans with no deductible for any drug. But in 2025, more than 45% of these members will be subject to a deductible for at least some drugs -- particularly brand-name or specialty medications -- if they stay in the same plan. Some insurers are also cutting back on allowances for dental, hearing and vision benefits.The parents of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, an Israeli-American murdered by Hamas militants in Gaza in August, described the \"crushing blow\" of losing their son and say they fear that other families will receive the same \"devastating news\" unless world leaders take urgent action to secure the release of the remaining hostages. In the interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, both parents were wearing stickers with \"374\" written on them to mark the number of days that have passed since the hostages were taken to Gaza by Hamas. As part of its escalated offensive against the militant group in the enclave, the Israeli military has ordered civilians to leave and blocked all food from entering northern Gaza. The UN has warned that Israel is effectively sealing off the area and may be carrying out a \"large-scale forced transfer\" of civilians, which it said would amount to a war crime.A weak La Niña is expected to develop ahead of winter and affect temperatures, precipitation and snow across the US. La Niña is a natural climate pattern that influences global weather marked by cooler-than-average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. If this year's La Niña ends up rather weak, winter is expected to be warmer than normal across almost the entire southern half of the US and much of the East. This could mean some winter storms in parts of the East end up wetter, rather than snowier. It's a complete flip from winter 2023, which favored a wetter South and a drier North. Last winter's pattern was the warmest on record for the Lower 48 because it was dominated by La Niña's counterpart El Niño in a world also warming due to fossil fuel pollution.Early voting begins in Georgia todayTwo critical battleground states in the 2024 presidential election -- Georgia and North Carolina -- are kicking off early in-person voting this week.
