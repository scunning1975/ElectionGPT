This shift follows Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, concluding a four-day tour of five battleground states.

However, no agreement has been reached yet between Trump, NBC, and Harris’s team regarding this debate. The only confirmed debate so far is scheduled for Sept. 10 in Philadelphia, which could set the stage for a potential showdown in Grand Rapids. If the debate takes place, it would bring Trump back to Michigan, a critical swing state where he last rallied supporters."}]}

Tom Barcellos, a lifelong farmer and president of the Lower Tule River Irrigation District, supports Republican policies and voices his frustration with the Democratic super-majority in both Sacramento and the federal government. The federal government controls a major water delivery system that supplies agricultural water to the San Joaquin Valley, where many farmers have grown frustrated with drought conditions and policies protecting endangered fish. Despite Harris’s time as a U.S. senator and California’s attorney general, she has not been significantly linked to water issues, according to both farmers and environmental advocates."}]}

Sanders’s concern follows Trump’s false claims that Harris has been using artificial intelligence to create fake images of thousands of attendees at her rallies, even going as far as to state that “nobody” showed up at a recent event in Detroit. Sanders accused Trump of laying the groundwork to convince his supporters that election results in key states like Pennsylvania and Michigan are fraudulent. He warned that if Trump could convince his base that thousands of rally-goers didn’t exist, he could do the same with election returns. Despite efforts from Trump’s allies to focus on Harris’s progressive stances during her 2020 primary run and her record in the Biden administration, these attempts have been largely unsuccessful."}]}

The poll has Harris at 47% and Trump at 44%, marking the fourth consecutive week where Harris has held the lead. With third-party candidates, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., on the ballot, Harris’s lead increases by two points. Harris’s lead is also growing in YouGov/Economist surveys, and a Reuters/Ipsos poll shows her leading Trump by one point when voters can express uncertainty about their choice. A New York Times/Siena poll found that 64% of voters are now paying closer attention to the race following the June 27 Biden-Trump debate. However, questions remain about the impact of Harris’s gender and race on voters, with 32% of Americans viewing these factors as either helpful or harmful, compared to 24% who see them as positive."}]}
