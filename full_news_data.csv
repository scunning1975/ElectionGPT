But the party is beginning to change around him.

And Barack Obama was blindsided when a Democrat gave him this brutal rejection.

The Democrat Party has made a hard Left turn over the past two decades to the point it's unrecognizable to some of its members.

Some Democrats have thrown in the towel and left their party after it became a socialist anti-American gathering.

Former California State Senate Majority Leader Gloria Romero (D-CA) was one of the most powerful Democrat politicians in the state.

She was a delegate for former President Barack Obama to the Democratic National Convention.

But Romero said that she was switching parties and becoming a Republican because she no longer recognizes the Democrat Party.

""Today, I say 'Goodbye - adios' -- I've had enough,"" Romero said. ""I am now another near-lifelong Democrat who is joining the growing number of people . . . who are leaving the Democratic Party.""

She added that many Hispanic voters are starting to walk away from the Democrats too.

""Today, I join the Republican Party to make America great again, and I am ready to do my part as America prepares to vote,"" Romero stated.

Romero noted that former President Ronald Reagan warned that if fascism ever came to America, it would be disguised as liberalism.

She said that the Democrats made ""a giant leap to authoritarianism [and] censorship"" in recent years.

And common sense isn't so common anymore among Democrats.

""It is terrifying to see how language has been modified so that, as a feminist and a former professor,"" Romero said. ""I would be condemned for saying that I can define a woman and distinguish between biological sex and gender identity. I am a mother and refuse to call myself a 'birthing person.'""

California has become the proving ground for the green energy policies of the radical environmental movement.

Romero lamented that Democrats are trying to outlaw the use of gas stoves.

""I for example think we are going to solve nothing by banning gas stoves,"" Romero said. ""As a Latina, I will not give up my gas stove because you cannot toast a tortilla on an electric range. That is just bad news, another reason to leave the Democratic Party.""

She announced that she would support former President Donald Trump this election because he had built a big tent party.

Trump has made inroads with traditionally Democrat-leaning groups this election, such as Hispanic, black, and younger voters, according to polling.

The former President could turn in the best performance with black and Hispanic voters by a Republican in decades.

Voters in these once reliable demographics for Democrats are leaving the party.

The woke socialist wing led by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) is taking control of the Democrat Party.

That's why Gloria Romero and other longtime Democrats have hit their breaking point and are finding a new political home.",[],https://renewedright.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/BarryOcall_RR.png,,0.223529411764706,renewedright.com,news,Renewed Right

The debate begins at 6 p.m. PDT on Tuesday, Sept. 10.

It will last 90 minutes, and there will be two commercial breaks, according to ABC.

ABC will air the event on television and several streaming networks, including ABC News Live, Disney+ and Hulu. It will also be available on the ABC app and online at ABC.com.

Several other networks will be broadcasting the debate live via simulcast.

Streaming or other networks will probably be an option for DirecTV subscribers who find they cannot access the debate. Because of a dispute over a distribution deal, Walt Disney Co.-owned channels, including ABC stations, were knocked off DirecTV platforms on Sept. 1 and it's unclear when the dispute will be resolved.

Anchors of the ABC show ""World News Tonight"" David Muir and Linsey Davis will moderate.

The two candidates will meet onstage at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, with no studio audience. There will be no opening statements. After introducing each candidate, the moderators will launch into questions.

Harris and Trump, who will stand behind lecterns, are not allowed to bring props or prewritten notes. They will be given a pen, a pad of paper and a bottle of water.

They will have two minutes for answers and rebuttals, and one extra minute for follow-ups, according to the debate rules.

Despite the Harris campaign's request to leave the microphones on for the entire debate, a candidate's microphone will be on only when it is their time to speak.

Based on a coin flip, Trump chose to get the final word and give the last two-minute closing statement.

Tuesday's debate marks 2Â½ months since President Biden and Trump faced off, beginning the rapid demise of Biden's presidential bid. The president appeared meandering and confused throughout the debate, giving incomplete answers and seeming to lose his train of thought at multiple points.

Trump also gave incomplete and meandering answers, including a multitude of falsehoods. But Biden's disastrous performance alarmed Democrats, who feared it could cost them the presidential race. Pressure in his own party for Biden to drop out mounted, and less than a month after the June 27 debate, Biden heeded the call.

He immediately threw his support behind Harris as his replacement to become the Democratic nominee. She kicked off a whirlwind campaign, clinching the nomination, naming Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate and quickly overtaking Biden in the polls.

Trump's campaign scrambled to reorganize itself around a new opponent, blasting Harris for her work on the border and the Biden administration's economic record -- and launching a flurry of personal insults, including questioning Harris' race.

Reports on social media about the demise of a downtown Aiken holiday tradition are premature.

The Hoofbeats and Christmas Carols Parade ""is still on as far as we know,"" Aiken City Manager Stuart Bedenbaugh said Sept. 9. ""No one has notified us formally that they're canceling the parade.""

Jim Rhodes, president and managing director of Equine Rescue of Aiken, expressed confidence that the parade would return this December.

""It's a go,"" he said.

Both Bedenbaugh and Rhodes told the Aiken Standard that they and others would be meeting Sept. 10 to discuss the logistics of the parade.

Also expected to attend were Aiken County Council Vice Chairman Andrew Siders, Aiken Department of Public Safety Chief Charles Barranco and Lt. Joe O'Conor of the Department of Public Safety, according to Rhodes and Bedenbaugh.

""The parade has grown over the years, and changes need to be made,"" Rhodes said. ""More than likely, it's going to be on Sunday, the 15th of December at 2 p.m. The route may be different; it's not set in stone yet. But the parade is going to happen.""

A Sept. 8 post on the Hoofbeats and Christmas Carols Parade's Facebook page stated that the event's committee and the Department of Public Safety ""have spent the past 6 months working on options for routes, times, dates and addressing safety concerns as well as concerns of downtown merchants, public safety, etc. There are a multitude of considerations that have been discussed in depth.""

But the two groups ""have not come to an agreement that we feel is safe and represents the Parade,"" the post continued.

The Aiken Standard reached out to two committee members, Trish Leslie and Samantha Charles, who also is known as Sammy Spitler, by phone, but no responses were received prior to the publication deadline for this story.

Bedenbaugh confirmed that there have been ""discussions about the parade route multiple times,"" but added that ""no permit was ever denied because no [request for a] permit was ever submitted.""

Equine Rescue of Aiken and the SPCA Albrecht Center for Animal Welfare are spearheading the plans for the parade moving forward.

""A couple of years ago, we signed an MOU (memorandum of understanding)... to where the parade was Equine Rescue of Aiken's and the SPCA's,"" Rhodes said. ""We allowed the management of the parade to stay with the original people ... and they are no longer involved. They are dropping out. We're taking it (the organization of the parade) over.""

The Hoofbeats and Christmas Carols Parade has been part of Aiken's holiday season for more than a decade. Last year, according to its Facebook page, more than 200 horses, 18 carriages and approximately 50 dogs participated. There were more than 60 volunteers.

The parade raised nearly $9,900 for Equine Rescue of Aiken and the SPCA, and additional money later was donated.

When an event such as the Hoofbeats and Christmas Carols Parade is conducted in Aiken, there are ""all kinds of factors we have to consider,"" Bedenbaugh said. ""We have to look at the parade participants and the number of parade participants, the impact to merchants and how the parade route will impact [Department of Public Safety] manpower.

""Also ... we have to ensure the safety of the entire community, which means the roadways and the expectations of people who are traveling through Aiken when the parade is taking place that have no interest in the parade.""

The route for both the Aiken Downtown Development Association's Christmas parade and Aiken's Memorial Day Parade runs west on Park Avenue and then north on Laurens Street.

Throughout those events, one side of those four-lane roads - divided by parkways and medians - remains open.

The Hoofbeats and Christmas Carols Parade travels south on Laurens Street and then east on Park Avenue before winding is way to The Willcox and then returning to its start.

Because of the circuitous route, parade participants use both sides of the roads, Bedenbaugh said.

Shortening the route is an option, according to Rhodes.

Another is for dogs and their walkers to only cover part of the route because, in the past, ""they have had a hard time keeping up [with the horses],"" he said.

Rhodes told the Aiken Standard that issues with downtown merchants ""never, ever, ever"" were a threat to the future of the Hoofbeats and Christmas Carols Parade.

There ""may have been one or two"" that expressed concern about having the event being conducted on a Saturday during the busy shopping season, Rhodes said, but he believes the overall opinion of the parade among downtown business owners is positive.

Adjustments to Hoofbeats and Christmas Carols Parade ""have been a long time in coming,"" Bedenbaugh concluded. ""It requires a lot of cooperation from a lot of different groups, and I think we are going to get there. We're just not there as of Monday morning (Sept. 9).""","{'uri': 'dede_biles_dbiles@postandcourier.com', 'name': 'Dede Biles Dbiles', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/e6/5e6f764c-6eb0-11ef-8230-1b85b0d76777/61be86fe2fe83.image.jpg?crop=1867%2C980%2C0%2C64&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize,,0.223529411764706,postandcourier.com,news,Post and Courier

They sure didn't look like a postseason contender in Week 1.

Kirk Cousins had a dismal debut with the Falcons on Sunday, throwing a pair of interceptions that brought back ugly memories of the Atlanta quarterbacks that came before him - Marcus Mariota, Desmond Ridder and Taylor Heinicke.

The team gave Cousins a four-year, $180 million contract to fix the most important position on the field, but it's clearly still a work in progress based on an 18-10 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers.

""We know he has to play better, thereÂ´s no doubt about that,"" said Raheem Morris, whose first game as Falcons coach was a huge disappointment. ""HeÂ´s played in the league for a long time. I look forward to him bouncing back from a rough game and a rough outing. IÂ´m not overly concerned with that.""

The defense kept the Steelers out of the end zone, which usually would be a formula for victory.

Chris Boswell accounted for all of Pittsburgh's scoring with six field goals, three of them beyond 50 yards.

The Falcons allowed only a couple of Steelers' possessions to even reach the red zone, halting their deepest drive with no points when Nate Landman stuffed Justin Fields on a fourth-and-1 sneak at the Atlanta 6.

The defense did have one major slipup. George Pickens got free between cornerback A.J. Terrell and safety Jessie Bates on the next-to-last play of the first half, hauling in a 33-yard pass that set up Boswell's 44-yard field goal heading to the locker room.

The Cousins-led offense looked out of sync most of the day.

The Steelers sacked the quarterback twice and pressured the pocket much of the game, making it difficult for the Falcons to find any sort of rhythm.

Cousins was supposed to beef up a passing game that was stagnant the last two years, forcing Atlanta to rely heavily on its running attack.

But the Falcons' longest play was a 20-yard completion to Ray-Ray McCloud - hardly the sort of dynamic production that was expected after handing Cousins $100 million in guaranteed money to run an offense that features top-10 picks Bijan Robinson, Drake London and Kyle Pitts at the skill positions.

Robinson showed flashes with 68 yards rushing and 43 yards receiving, but Pitts didn't do much beyond hauling in a 12-yard pass for Atlanta's only touchdown. As for London, Atlanta's leading deep threat, he was targeted just three times and finished with two catches for a measly 15 yards.

""We need to play better. ThatÂ´s the bottom line,"" Cousins said. ""I thought our defense played very well. I thought our special teams played very well. We didnÂ´t complement that enough on offense.""

Returning from a knee injury that cut short his 2023 season, Grady Jarrett looked like himself again with some dominating play on the defensive line.

He had 1 1/2 sacks and three hits on Fields, who got the start for the Steelers after Russell Wilson was forced to sit with a calf injury.

Jarrett has 117 QB hits in his career, passing John Abraham (115) for the most in team history.

""Really?"" Jarrett said after the game when told of the record. ""ThatÂ´s awesome. I wish more of those QB hits were sacks, but that means a lot. I take a lot of pride in that one. IÂ´ll continue to raise that number and keep them from scoring.""

It's only one week, but the Falcons already are facing scrutiny for doling out a huge contract to the 36-year-old Cousins, especially when they used their first-round draft pick to grab another quarterback, Michael Penix Jr.

Cousins looked shaky most of the game, completing 16 of 26 passes for just 155 yards to go along with that pair of picks.

But let's not forget this was the first game action for Cousins - regular season or preseason - since tearing his Achilles tendon last Oct. 29 while playing for the Minnesota Vikings. He was understandably rusty, and it didn't help to go against T.J. Watt and one of the league's toughest defenses.

The Falcons came into Week 1 in good health and appeared to get through the game largely unscathed.

The only player who didnÂ´t suit up because of injury was No. 5 cornerback Antonio Hamilton (groin). The only report during the game was OG Chris Lindstrom being evaluated for a possible head injury, but he was cleared to return.

3-0 - In addition to Cousins throwing two interceptions, the Falcons lost a fumble on a botched snap and were fortunate to have another fumble overturned by a dubious penalty.

The Steelers, on the other hand, didn't have any turnovers.

""You canÂ´t expect anything else when you turn the ball over three times,"" Morris said. ""Basically, thatÂ´s the story of the game.""

Considering their upcoming schedule, the Falcons sure could've used a victory on opening day.

They'll face a hostile environment next Monday night when they travel to Philadelphia to take on the Eagles (1-0).

Then it's back home on Sept. 22 for another prime-time game against Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs (1-0), the two-time reigning Super Bowl champions.

DirecTV filed a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission on Saturday night accusing Disney of negotiating in bad faith.

Disney channels, including ESPN and ABC-owned stations in nine markets, have been off DirecTV since the evening of Sept. 1. That meant DirecTV customers were blacked out from viewing most college football games and the final week of the U.S. Open tennis tournament, including the women's and men's finals.

DirecTV has 11.3 million subscribers, according to Leichtman Research Group, making it the nation's third-largest pay TV provider.

ABC and ESPN will have the ""Monday Night Football"" opener between the New York Jets and San Francisco 49ers. ABC will also produce and carry a presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump on Tuesday in Philadelphia.

ABC-owned stations in Los Angeles; the San Francisco Bay Area; Fresno, California; New York; Chicago; Philadelphia; Houston; and Raleigh, North Carolina, are off DirecTV.

Besides all ESPN network channels and ABC-owned stations, Disney-branded channels Freeform, FX and National Geographic channel are dark.

DirecTV says in its 10-page complaint that Disney is violating the FCC's good faith mandates by asking it to waive any legal claims on any anticompetitive actions, including its ongoing packaging and minimum penetration demands.

DirecTV has asked Disney for the option to provide consumers with cheaper and skinnier bundles of programming, instead of bigger bundles that carry programming some viewers might not be interested in watching.

The complaint states: ""Along with these anticompetitive demands, Disney has also insisted that DirecTV agree to a 'clean slate' provision and a covenant not to sue, both of which are intended to prevent DirecTV from taking legal action regarding Disney's anticompetitive demands, which would include filing good faith complaints at the Commission. Not three months ago, however, the Media Bureau made clear that such a demand itself constitutes bad faith.""

DirecTV CEO Ray Carpenter said during a conference call with business and media analysts on Tuesday that they would not agree to a new carriage deal with Disney without bundling changes.

""We're not playing a short-term game,"" Carpenter said. ""We need something that is going to work for the long-term sustainability of our video customers. The resolve is there.""

Disney has claimed since the blackout began that mutual release of claims is standard practice after licensing agreements are negotiated and agreed upon by the parties. It has also had one with DirecTV under its past renewals.

A Disney spokesperson said: ""We continue to negotiate with DirecTV to restore access to our content as quickly as possible. We urge DirecTV to stop creating diversions and instead prioritize their customers by finalizing a deal that would allow their subscribers to watch our strong upcoming lineup of sports, news and entertainment programming, starting with the return of Monday Night Football.""

Funding for the federal government expires Sept. 30, when the 2024 fiscal year ends. Without new legislation, the government would shut down while millions of voters, including in some battleground states, are already able to cast their votes.

Congress is set to consider a stopgap funding bill, called a continuing resolution or CR, to keep operations going at current levels and buy legislators more time to craft annual spending bills. But Republicans, who control the House, and Democrats, who run the Senate, disagree on how long to extend funding for - a crucial question in which control of the White House weighs heavily.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) plans to put a CR up for a vote that extends federal funding until March 28. He is set to attach unrelated legislation that would require voters to show proof of citizenship before registering to vote for federal elections. That bill already passed the House in July. Noncitizen voting is already illegal in federal races, and election administration experts say the proposal could wreak havoc on states' ability to run elections.

""House Republicans are taking a critically important step to keep the federal government funded and to secure our federal election process,"" Johnson said in a statement. ""Congress has a responsibility to do both, and we must ensure that only American citizens can decide American elections.""

Democrats - and even some senior House Republicans - prefer a continuing resolution that extends until just after the November vote, allowing lawmakers in an end-of-year ""lame duck"" session to hammer out funding bills with fewer political consequences for either side and freeing whoever is president come January from an early spending fight.

""I would rather get these fiscal year 2025 bills out of the way so that when you do have Trump in the White House, you have a Republican House and Republican Senate, we can spend the beginning of this next Republican presidency not dealing with last year's battles, but dealing with the very, very ambitious agenda the President Trump has put forward,"" Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, told The Washington Post.

The disagreement is not much of an impasse, lawmakers say. The most likely scenario, officials from both parties privately concede, is that Democrats will reject the voting restrictions while Republicans demand the March funding deadline.

The longer bill, though, will force Congress later this calendar year to consider additional spending legislation for other programs set to expire before March or those that need supplemental resources.

The Department of Veterans Affairs requires an additional $15 billion: $3 billion to make up for a looming benefits shortfall, and $12 billion in resources to provide care for military service members suffering from the affects of toxic burn pits. House appropriators introduced legislation Friday to make up for the benefits needs, but have not addressed the remaining issues.

Portions of the farm bill, the massive five-year agriculture policy legislation, expire Sept. 30, and others expire at the end of the year. Lawmakers considered attaching a one-year farm bill extension to the CR, but opted against it.

Leaders from both parties favor providing Maryland additional money to rebuild Baltimore's collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge. That, along with funding for other failing roadways, could cost up to $3.1 billion. Those funds were also not included in the CR.

""We need a continuing resolution because House Republicans let their most extreme members drive the ship. A continuing resolution that ends in December - rather than one that lasts a half year - is better for our national security and military readiness, veterans and their families, victims recovering from natural disasters and all hardworking American taxpayers,"" Rep. Rosa DeLauro (Conn.), the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said in a statement.

The relative calm in the spending debate is tenuous. Election momentum could change the political calculus of either side.

House Democrats are bullish on their chances of winning the majority, and with a March deadline could control the levers of power to write their own funding bills if they hold the Senate and the White House. Republicans, also eyeing a sweep of Congress and the White House, see the later deadline as a chance to solidify their legislative priorities, too.

But pushing the funding fight into 2025 would complicate the next president's first 100 days in office, when Democrats would hope to expand voting rights and pursue new social spending for child care and other programs, and Republicans would try to pass a sweeping tax law.

GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump could also influence the government funding picture. Trump and Republican officials nationwide have falsely spread rumors that noncitizen voting could sway the outcome of the presidential race. In fact, noncitizens casting ineligible ballots is vanishingly rare. But as Trump makes the innuendo a larger part of his campaign, some of his chief backers in Congress could feel compelled to demand voter eligibility restrictions remain part of the continuing resolution. And Republicans hope to use the issue to force vulnerable Democrats to discuss immigration, a policy area where polls show conservatives with a clear political advantage.",[],https://matzav.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/congress-capitol.jpg,,-0.1450980392156863,matzav.com,news,matzav.com

Wall Street's three major indexes closed higher on Monday as investors looked for bargains after the previous week's sell-off while they also waited for inflation reports in coming days and the Federal Reserve's next policy decision next week.

Investors had fled from equities last week when Friday's weaker-than-expected August jobs data followed weak manufacturing data on Tuesday, driving the Nasdaq Composite's biggest weekly loss since January 2022, and the S&amp;P 500's biggest weekly decline since March 2023.

Along with jitters about the U.S. economy's health investors have been contending with uncertainty about the Fed's interest rate decision due Sept. 18. But they arrived at their desks in what looked like more bullish moods on Monday.

""Investors had a little time over the weekend to think about things. Clearly there was an over-reaction to economic data last week. It raised over-blown fears of a potential recession,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. ""A pause gives you the opportunity to be more rational.""

According to preliminary data, the S&amp;P 500 gained 63.01 points, or 1.16%, to end at 5,471.16 points, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 196.83 points, or 1.18%, to 16,884.60. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 481.09 points, or 1.19%, to 40,826.50.

This week's key events include the consumer price index (CPI) report, due Wednesday morning after Tuesday night's first debate between U.S. presidential candidates Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump ahead of the Nov. 5 election.

But in the meantime Phil Blancato, chief market strategist at Osaic Wealth, New York said investors are taking another look at ""high quality stocks that are cheaper.""

In particular Blancato pointed to gains on Monday in shares of market heavyweight and artificial intelligence chipmaker favorite Nvidia, which fell 15.3% last week.

However, since trading is usually more muted before big economic news, Blancato was concerned to see a rally before Wednesday's CPI inflation report, which is expected to help inform whether the Fed cuts rates by 25 or 50 basis points.

""The market's expecting a very soft print and locking in a Fed cut. What happens if we don't get that?"" said Blancato who expects volatility after whatever decision the Fed makes.

Some investors will be disappointed if the Fed only cuts rates by 25 basis points but if the cut is double that, they will be worried that the Fed has big concerns about the economy.

""It's a lose-lose situation,"" the strategist said.

Wednesday's report is expected to show a moderation in headline inflation in August to 2.6% on a yearly basis, while on a monthly basis it is expected to remain unchanged at 0.2%. The CPI report will be followed by producer prices data on Thursday.

During Monday's session, Apple Inc shares fell after it unveiled its artificial intelligence-boosted

iPhone 16

.

Apple's long-awaited phone launch came hours after Chinese rival Huawei began racking up orders for its tri-fold Mate XT phone.

Boeing shares advanced after the planemaker and its biggest union reached a tentative deal covering more than 32,000 workers, averting a possible strike.

Shares in Palantir, Dell Technologies and Erie rose on the news issued late Friday they will all join the S&amp;P 500 index on Sept. 23.

In the benchmark index, these stocks will replace American Airlines Group, Etsy and Bio-Rad Laboratories .

Amid all his nonsensical ramblings, Donald Trump vows to impose three radical policies that are violent, antidemocratic and monumentally foolish. Do not dismiss these promises as ""just Trump being Trump."" Believe the man when he tells you who he is and what he means to do if he is again elected president.

In virtually every campaign speech, Trump pledges to deport up to 12 million undocumented immigrants. It might sound impossible, but there is no reason to doubt he would try. Demonizing immigrants has been a consistent theme for Trump since his first campaign, and as president he punished asylum-seekers by deliberately separating families and housing children in cages.

On Saturday, at a rally in Wisconsin, Trump justified this plan by citing a false story about Venezuelan gang members having taken over an apartment complex in a Denver suburb. Police there say no such thing happened. But Trump trumpeted the lie and said that expelling migrants from the country ""will be a bloody story.""

Imagine how bloody it would be to rip millions of men, women and children out of communities across the nation. Stephen Miller, the adviser most responsible for immigration policy during Trump's presidency, has envisioned using the National Guard to ""go around the country arresting illegal immigrants in large-scale raids."" Miller's fever dream goes on to imagine ""large-scale staging grounds near the border, most likely in Texas"" where migrants would await transport by air to their home countries.

Even if you put aside the inhumanity of such a program, imagine the impact on the economy. Trump tells audiences that undocumented migrants are taking ""Black jobs"" and ""Hispanic jobs,"" but overall unemployment is near historic lows. Employers in cities and towns nationwide would be bereft.

Yes, this is madness. But experience teaches that Trump and his team, objectively, are mad.

Another promise Trump makes consistently, and that we should take seriously, is he will use presidential power to punish his political enemies. On Saturday, after the Wisconsin rally, Trump posted a screed on Truth Social renewing his false and disproven claims about losing the 2020 election only because of voter fraud.

""WHEN I WIN, those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law, which will include long term prison sentences so that this Depravity of Justice does not happen again,"" Trump wrote. ""Please beware that this legal exposure extends to Lawyers, Political Operatives, Donors, Illegal Voters, & Corrupt Election Officials. Those involved in unscrupulous behavior will be sought out, caught, and prosecuted at levels, unfortunately, never seen before in our Country.""

Trump's clear subtext is payback for the federal and state prosecutions he faces -- trying to equate his own conduct with that of his political opponents. But there is a huge and obvious difference. Dozens of federal and state judges, including a number of Trump appointees, found no evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 election. But federal and state grand juries did find reason to indict Trump on felony charges for trying to overturn the election and absconding to Mar-a-Lago with a hoard of highly classified documents.

Trump's anger might be unjustified, but it is real. He will surely take the Supreme Court's recent decision on presidential immunity as a green light to use the Justice Department as a weapon of vengeance.

Some might believe Trump's boasts about mass deportations and political prosecutions are purely rhetorical, though I do not. But there is no room for doubt about one disastrous policy he swears to implement: There will be tariffs.

Trump's all-purpose economic snake oil is imposing tariffs on imported goods. At various points, he has proposed a 10 percent tariff across the board, a tariff of up to 60 percent on Chinese imports specifically, and a 100 percent tariff on goods from countries that stop using the U.S. dollar as their reserve currency.

He seems sincerely, and incredibly, unable to understand how tariffs work. He portrays them as ""taxes"" on foreign countries, but actually it is U.S. importers who foot the bill, who will then pass those extra costs along to consumers. Trump's tariffs would effectively be a huge tax increase on any American who buys anything made overseas.

Speaking last week to the Economic Club of New York -- of all audiences -- Trump defended this bad idea by praising the McKinley Tariff, an 1890 measure that raised import duties to nearly 50 percent and caused prices to soar. The tariff, named for Republican House member and future president William McKinley, ended up making Americans poorer and producing less revenue for the government, not more.

Anyone who wonders whether a second Trump term would really be so bad should listen to what he intends to do. It won't just be bad. It will be much, much worse.","{'uri': 'eugene_robinson@washingtonpost.com', 'name': 'Eugene Robinson', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}",https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MJ4NP6XCGQI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg&w=1440,eng-9884926,-0.2627450980392156,washingtonpost.com,news,Washington Post

A Harvard CAPS/Harris poll found Trump up just 1 point over Harris among registered voters, 47 percent to 46 percent, a narrowing of his lead since July. Another 7 percent were undecided.

When undecideds were asked which candidate they lean toward, the race solidified into an even 50-50 tie between the presidential rivals. In July, Trump led the hypothetical by 4 points.

Harris and Trump are also tied in a four-way race with independent candidate Cornel West and the Green Party's Jill Stein, both with and without leaners.

""In terms of the popular vote, Harris has drawn even with Trump with a surge of key demographic blocs,"" said Mark Penn, the co-director of the poll.

Both presidential candidates are otherwise winning their party bases, with white, male and rural voters favoring Trump, while Black, urban and college-educated voters favored Harris. A third of independent voters notably say they're still deciding.

Hispanic voters are split. Fifty percent favor Harris, while 43 percent pick Trump. The leftover 7 percent are unsure, and that marks ""a key pick up"" for Trump, Penn said.

""The election is likely to hinge on this key group,"" he added.

The Harvard CAPS/Harris results are in line with a new poll from the New York Times/Siena College that put Trump up 1 point against Harris, while an Emerson College Polling survey found Harris with a slight edge over the former president. Polling averages from The Hill/Decision Desk HQ have Harris with a 3-point lead nationally.

All together, the numbers show Harris and Trump heading into their first debate amidst a tight race. They'll face off on ABC News on Tuesday, mere months after a debate between Trump and President Biden led to the incumbent's historic exit from the race.

Like the White House contest, the battle for the House and Senate also looks highly competitive. On a generic congressional ballot, Democrats and Republicans were tied at 45 percent each, with another 8 percent picking third-party candidates and 3 percent undecided. Adding in leaners, Democrats had a 2-point advantage, a shift to toward the party after Republicans were up 4 points in July.

The survey was conducted Sept. 4-5 among 2,358 registered voters by The Harris Poll and HarrisX. It is a collaboration of the Center for American Political Studies at Harvard University and the Harris Poll. The margin of error for the total sample is plus or minus 2.1 percentage points.

Results were weighted for age within gender, region, race/ethnicity, marital status, household size, income, employment, education, political party, and political ideology where necessary to align them with their actual proportions in the population. Propensity score weighting was also used to adjust for respondents' propensity to be online.","{'uri': 'julia_mueller@thehill.com', 'name': 'Julia Mueller', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Kamala-Harris-Donald-Trump-08.20.png?strip=1&w=640,spa-3601911,-0.02745098039215688,thehill.com,news,The Hill
