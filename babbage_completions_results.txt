Second, some very encouraging news. The number of registered voters in the United States grew by more than 3 million last week. This was a jump from the 2.3 million registered voters the Trump campaign registered on August 13th, which was President Trump's 70th birthday. To put that in context, that was more than the combined total of the previous 29 days of the Trump campaign. The Democrats only had 23,000 new registered voters on August 13th. So, we're actually 10 times as big as the Democrats on August 13th.

As I've said many times, if the Democrats had 10 times as many registered voters as the Republicans, they would be the most nervous group on Earth. The Democratic Party's stock is literally going down. The Republicans are still holding up. But the Democrats are going sideways, to be honest with you.

There's some very encouraging things happening in the 2024 presidential election. The Democratic Party is disintegrating. The Republicans are holding up."

To highlight some of the news from the news outlet, Politico, here are some of the things that happened on August 13th:

The Trump campaign said that between 2.3 million and 2.4 million people registered for an online-only ticket to the 2024 presidential election in Fulton, Georgia. That's about 30% cheaper than the number of people who registered on the first day of the campaign, which was more than 100,000.

That was more than the combined total of the previous 29 days of the Trump campaign. The Democrats only had 23,000 new registered voters on August 13th. So, we're actually 10 times as big as the Democrats on August 13th."

There are rumors that Vice President Kamala Harris might try to mount a challenge to Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election. What's the latest on the polls there?

I have to say, the polls are very, very mixed. I mean, the Democrats are going in one direction and the Republicans are going in another direction. So, it's very hard to tell. The thing that's interesting is that this last week, the Democrats had 60% of registrations in the two battleground states that Donald Trump and his campaign are so confident in. The two battleground states that Donald Trump and his campaign are so confident in. The two battleground states that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are so confident in.

 "This is an existential choice," Biden said in Phoenix, according to a pool report.

 "The future of America is at stake," Biden said. "We either fight for it, or it fights for us."

And fights for us, it did. In a historic 2024 presidential election, the question is no longer whether Trump is still relevant -- he is, to the tune of $100 million or so -- but rather how much does he still matter, and where does that final zero -0- on his official 2024 election ballot lie?

Not even close, if you ask the Trump campaign, which seems to be doing most of the heavy lifting in this election. And that zero -0- may even move on Tuesday, depending on what the polls say.

It's not even the best number the campaign has ever seen, even if you discount the infamous Magic 7 phone from 2004. It came from even older Excel files, which the team kept in a safe deposit box in its Warrenton, Virginia, home, and the whole thing was simply copied down from a computer desktop to a hard drive in a backroom in Boris Dickson's office.

It is, as Trump claims, an accurate reflection of the state of the race, with the former president lagging behind in polls even though he has spent $100 million to his campaign's credit. And that zero -0- may even move by Tuesday.

The latest version of the Trump campaign's polling model, which was last updated in early August, shows the former president lagging behind by three points, 44 percent to 41 percent, in a three-way head-to-head matchup with Biden and Harris.

You can download the model here and play around with the data yourself.

It helps to have a solid understanding of which data is important and which is not, as well as a sense of the overall size and complexity of the presidential election landscape.

So, here's some context for the numbers that follow.

It's still early, so take them with a grain of salt.

There's a difference between early and stupidly early.

Events are still unfolding, and there are a lot of unknowns regarding the dynamics of this cycle, as opposed to a snapshot of the data a few weeks earlier.

What's more, there's a lot less information to work with, compared to two years ago.

So here's what we do know, for example, about what could drive the race to the bottom: There's a lot of money left, and there's a lot of fight left, and

 "For the first time in 28 years, the Republican Party is back in a position to nominate a vice presidential pick who can galvanize the party behind a decisive 2024 election strategy, and that is Senator Brian Kemp of Georgia."

I think everyone knows that, if you're a Republican, you know that the only upside to this election is that maybe you can grab a hold of the nomination and say, 'Hey, you know, we'll give it a shot.' Because, frankly, if I'm a Republican, I'm thinking about the past. I'm thinking about the fact that, you know, if we just take the 2024 presidential election and we boil it down to just one thing, I think we might all just agree that we're all kind of tired of that.

You know, the Democrats have said that they want to make it a national game, where every college student in the country can come to the United States and say, 'Hey, I'm coming to college on the taxpayer's dime, so I deserve to take a week off work for the 2024 election.' And then the Republicans are saying, 'Hey, you know what? That's not how it's going to work. There's a reason we've got 90 million people on the taxpayer's dime. We can't just keep giving it to the Democrats.'

I mean, the Democrats just say, 'Hey, we're going to take the two biggest parties in America and we're going to drag one of them kicking and screaming into the 21st century, and then the other one's going to be lost in the backwoods of North Carolina.'

And I think we all know where the Democrats are going to be lost in the backwoods of North Carolina. I mean, they're going to be lost in a couple of little towns in North Carolina. I mean, you know, the coastal cities in the United States, I mean, I say this as someone who lives in a couple of the coastal cities in the United States, the big coastal cities in the United States. I mean, I say this as someone who lives in Los Angeles, I mean, I say this as someone who lives in New York. I mean, I say this as someone who lives in San Francisco.

 "Experts say we're not ready for a general election in Trump's October campaign season." Why? Well, as you might expect, the reason why is pretty simple: Trump is still a very real danger to the election, and the fact that he could even get into a debate with the frontrunner, Joe Biden, is still fairly close to a sure thing. And sure, the two do have some things in common.

For example, the two are both roughly the same age, and both have made a good deal of their political careers developing a style and a reputation that the other one simply can't match. And sure, this election is far from a slam dunk, and there's a good chance that Trump could even surprise a few people along the way. But here are a few things that experts say are pretty much a certainty at this point, and the fact that they are still pretty much a certainty should give you some idea of just how far the race has gone from seeming like it might be a pretty simple thing:

1. Trump will be in the race right until Labor Day weekend, at the very least.

As you might expect, the two leading candidates in the race have been going at it pretty hard lately, with Trump seeming to be the more aggressive of the two. At least that's the impression that the news media, polling firms and other experts seem to be going out of their way to create.

After all, it wouldn't be a surprise if Trump slammed out a string of more or less blundering headlines on the eve of Labor Day weekend.

For example, Trump accused Joe Biden of doing "a horrible job" with the vice presidential debate, and it seems that pretty much all that the Biden campaign is putting together is a way to make sure that Trump can be seen as the most ready candidate for the debate that is coming up on Labor Day weekend.

2. Trump will be able to put a lid on things a bit based on some factors that are pretty much out of his control.

As you might expect, it would be pretty hard for Trump to organize a presidential debate with the two major candidates in the race pretty much based on the fact that the two parties have basically agreed that the other guy is going to be out of place.

For example, it would be pretty hard to put together a debate between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris if the big guy is just going to have to sit there and watch while the two of the hottest candidates in the
